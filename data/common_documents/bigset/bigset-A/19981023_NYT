MOTORISTS FIND PLENTY TO DO DLING IN TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's 8:30 a.m. The San Diego Freeway is jammed
solid, the Ventura Freeway a vast tableau of idling cars.
</P>
<P>
   Time to floss!
</P>
<P>
   Or shave, read mail or apply some underarm deodorant, said
motorists who took part in a survey released Thursday that details
all the things drivers do when stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide, informal survey of 15,000 drivers found that
Americans are reclaiming time lost to their commutes by
multi-tasking on the road -- converting their cars into mobile
offices, boudoirs and reading rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised few in the city that invented the
SigAlert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you have much choice,'' said attorney Barbara
Minkoff of Westlake Village, who admits to the occasional car-phone
call. ``That's the life you choose when you live in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Munoz, an 18-year-old receptionist, said he sometimes
finishes dressing in the car if time is tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take off my shirt, put on a work shirt if I'm late,'' he
said. ``I haven't gotten into a crash yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz isn't alone in dressing on the go. More than one-fourth of
the drivers surveyed changed clothes behind the wheel, according to
the report, produced by the Pennzoil motor oil company. Forty-two
percent read either mail or a book.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of the women answering the survey applied
makeup in the car. So did 4 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9 percent of respondents plucked nose hairs while
idling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's more surprising findings: Californians
actually do less multi-tasking on the road than the national
average. Those in Southern states do more.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that those ages 16 to 35 are more likely than
members of other generations to get dressed or style their hair in
traffic. In general, older people seemed far less willing to divide
their attention while driving.
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol Officer Frank Sandoval said that while
the labor-intensive activities listed in the survey aren't illegal,
they also aren't a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving is something that needs all of your attention,'' he
said. ``If your mind's not focused, you're not going to be able to
stop if something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a little furtive flossing cause an accident, Sandoval
said the driver could be fined for driving at a speed unsafe for
existing conditions -- namely, the condition of flossing one's
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Crump, vice president of marketing for Pennzoil, said the
survey grew out of the company's efforts to track its customers'
driving habits. However, some of the report's more personal
findings might not be particularly useful, she conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we'll include nose-hair plucking in the
development of our new products,'' Crump said.
</P>
<P>
   A quick and totally unscientific survey of drivers in L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley on Thursday found that most reached for their
mobile phones when stuck in traffic. They called sometimes out of
boredom, but mostly to ease their squeezed schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three children, a full-time job, and time is
precious,'' said Lamia Jarjour, a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep her attention on the road, Jarjour has worked out
a system of dialing only when stopped dead on the road. ``Thank God
I haven't gotten into trouble yet,'' she said.

ZANARDI SET FOR FINAL CART RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The running of the FedEx CART Marlboro 500 on Nov.
1 at Fontana's California Speedway will end an era in American
open-wheel racing as well as the 1998 season. Italian Alex Zanardi,
who has dominated the series during his three-year stay, will make
his final run before heading home to Europe and his new Formula One
team.
</P>
<P>
   And three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal, winner of 24 tour
races including the 1986 Indianapolis 500, will race for the final
time in his 17-year CART career.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi, who has won 15 times and won two season titles (1997,
1998) since joining Target/Chip Ganassi Racing as an unproven
unknown in 1996, will be the favorite to take the 500-mile race,
won last year by Mark Blundell. He has a remarkable .300 winning
percentage (15 wins in 50 starts) since joining the tour.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an upset if Rahal wins. The 45-year-old crowd
favorite's last victories came in 1992, when he won four times.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi wrapped up this year's season points title long ago. But
with the winner of the 500-mile run promised a purse of $1 million
_ the biggest of the season _ there will be plenty of incentive to
win. Zanardi would like to run well. He missed last year's race
after crashing twice in practice.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 tickets remained Thursday for the race, but
California Speedway spokesman Jay Lucas said they are expected to
be gone by race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little over 115,000 (fans) and were sold out for the
Winston Cup race and we expect the same for CART,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets also remain for the Friday and Saturday before the race,
Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   CART and Indy Lights drivers will practice on Friday, with Indy
Lights qualifying set for 12:45 p.m. There is more practice on
Saturday, with CART qualifying at noon, and the 100-mile Indy
Lights race at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The track will open at 7 a.m. on Nov. 1, with the Marlboro 500
to start at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Almost too late:Valencia's Sean Woodside set a track record, won
the pole and the race at this past Saturday's NASCAR Winston West
Spears Manufacturing 250 in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   But with just one race left _ Nov. 7 in Las Vegas _ it is
probably too late to catch series leader Kevin Harvick for the
season title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only got to run 13th or better to win it regardless of
how I do,'' Woodside said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, who has been second to Palmdale's Harvick most of the
season, said his plans for 1999 remain uncertain. He would like to
move up to the NASCAR Busch Grand National or Craftsman truck
series after a probable two straight season runner-up campaigns in
Winston West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get that big phone call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of his present team, Golden West Racing, is in doubt
as owner Ray Claridge has said he wants to obtain a major sponsor
if his Winston West effort is to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by the phone: Another local driver hoping for the call
to bigger things is North Hollywood product Jeff Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, who now lives in Las Vegas, made a big impression on the
KOOL/Toyota Atlantic series this season. As a part-time driver for
the Arciero-Wells Atlantic team, he had finishes of seventh, sixth,
fourth in just four starts. In his other start, he won the pole but
was dropped to the back of the field by a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arciero-Wells and KOOL Green racing teams are rumored to be
interested in putting Shafer on the Atlantic series full-time next
year.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE schedule: The SCORE off-road series will host six races in
1999: Jan. 21-23, Laughlin Desert Challenge, Laughlin, Nev.; March
19-21, Tecate SCORE San Felipe 250, San Felipe, Mexico; June 4-6,
Tecate SCORE Baja 500, Ensenada, Mexico; July 16-17, SCORE
Fireworks 250, Barstow; Sept. 10-11, SCORE Las Vegas Primm 300,
Primm, Nev.; Nov. 5-8, Tecate SCORE Baja 1000, Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: IRL driver and seven-time American Motorcyclist
Association motocross champ Jeff Ward will try to make the field at
Sunday's Winston Cup Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 in Phoenix. It will be the
first time in a stock car for Ward, who finished sixth in season
points with the IRL this year. . . . Palmdale's Ron Hornaday Jr.
trails defending Craftsman Truck champion Jack Sprague by 28 points
with just two races remaining, Saturday's GM Goodwrench Service
Plus/AC Delco 300K in Phoenix and a Nov. 8 race in Las Vegas. . . .
Reacting to the growing popularity of NASCAR, Dover Downs
International Speedway in Delaware will add 15,000 seats next
season, bringing the grandstand total to 122,000. . . . Alex
Barron, 27th in CART season points this rookie year, has been
re-signed by All American Racers owner Dan Gurney. . . . Motocross
racing is set for Saturday night at Orange County Speedway in Costa
Mesa, where riders will compete for a $50,000 purse in the MCD
FreeRide Motocross championship. Gates open at 4:30 p.m. &QL;

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Critical issues were resolved Thursday night at
the Middle East peace talks here as President Clinton pushed into
the night to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions emerged on issues that include an agreement
by the Palestinians to revise their charter to remove clauses
calling for the destruction of Israel and to arrest 30 of 36
Palestinians the Israelis want extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said a deal on a third withdrawal of Israeli
troops from the West Bank, as the Palestinians demand, was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear breakthrough,'' the Israeli industry
minister, Natan Sharansky, said Thursday night of the talks between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was not finished as midnight neared.
</P>
<P>
   To try to keep up the momentum, Clinton asked King Hussein of
Jordan to speak to the leaders and their key advisers just after 10
p.m. They all gathered at a dining table overlooking the Wye River
and heard Clinton summarize the state of the talks. The king,
ailing with cancer, then delivered what officials called ``an
impassioned speech,'' lasting some 10 minutes, calling on Netanyahu
and Arafat to keep making progress and press for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``spirits are good _ he is determined to stick with
this as long as it's a productive use of his time,'' Joe Lockhart,
the White House spokesman, said Thursday night. He and James Rubin,
the State Department spokesman, said advances had been made on a
number of issues, but that advances did not mean complete
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the half dozen serious issues, there have been advances,''
Rubin said. ``But an advance doesn't mean that it's closed. I've
seen them talk for hours over a few words.''
</P>
<P>
   One critical issue apparently resolved Thursday night involved
the Israeli demand that the full Palestine National Council amend
the Palestinian charter, formally removing 26 clauses calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was finessed, Israeli officials said, when the
Palestinians agreed to convene the council along with other
Palestinian institutions in the territories at the end of the
three-month settlement. American officials say the Palestinian
Central Council would vote to amend the charter after eight weeks,
while that vote would be ratified informally by ``all relevant
bodies'' including parts of the Palestinian National Council.
</P>
<P>
   Both Palestinian and Israeli officials say Clinton will attend
that larger meeting, presumably in Gaza, but there was no immediate
confirmation from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council, which includes expatriate Palestinians,
some of whom are wanted as terrorism suspects, will not convene as
a whole, officials say, in part because of fears that it could even
vote Arafat out of office. The idea of the larger meeting is to
``bless the whole process in the public way the Israelis wanted,''
an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The key compromise idea came from the Israeli defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, officials said, and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright sold it to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue was the Palestinian demand that the Israelis
guarantee a separate troop withdrawal from the West Bank, the third
called for under the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords. The Palestinians
do not want it to be wrapped into talks about a final settlement
that would also settle the Palestinian Authority's final
boundaries. Officials say language is being worked out on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A commission of both sides working in parallel with the final
peace talks will handle the timing and size of the third
``redeployment,'' or withdrawal, essentially postponing the issue
for now. American officials said that by being handled in that way,
the issue should not block the peace process later, as the first
two deployments have for 19 months now.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli demand for the extradition of 36 Palestinians _ 31
of them wanted for capital offenses like murder _ was resolved with
a Palestinian agreement to arrest 30 of the 31.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was being made on a Palestinian demand that Israel
release 3,500 Palestinian prisoners arrested for security offenses,
as called for under the Oslo accords. Israel had said it would not
release those ``with blood on their hands.'' American officials say
that the Israelis have agreed to release ``several hundred''
prisoners, and that this may be enough for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still outstanding is the exact method by which Israel will
provide safe passage for Palestinians traveling between the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the talks is Arafat's threat to declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally when the Oslo process ends next May
4. Netanyahu has warned Arafat not to do this, and the Americans
also are opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The main elements of a deal would be carried out over 12 weeks,
or soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived Thursday morning for his sixth day of
intense personal involvement here, spent the evening talking first
to Netanyahu, while Albright spoke with Arafat, and then vice
versa, in what the Americans called ``tag-team diplomacy.'' Hussein
spoke to the leaders on the telephone from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   The main discussions were taking place in a tent off the main
dining room at the conference center here, to keep the numbers of
participants small, officials said. Thursday night, Clinton
reconvened a joint meeting of the key members of both delegations
to try to finish off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday evening, the Israeli and the Palestinian
delegations, of about 20 people each, chatted within 20 feet of
each other in the dining room, with the Israelis gathered around a
fireplace on couches and chairs and the Palestinians sitting at a
table. The Americans were at the main dining table, with Clinton
and Albright _ as well as the national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, and Dennis Ross, the special envoy _ huddling over
proposals to bring to one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rubin compared the atmosphere to ``a cloakroom, with the feeling
and flavor of a legislative session drawing to a close,'' as final
deals are being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean that they will draw to a close,'' he
added. ``But it certainly had that flavor of a lot of people
standing in different parts of the same room, shuttling between one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke over a speakerphone to a huddled mass of journalists
crowded around a small table in the press center here, at
Chesapeake College.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were working with the text of an American plan given
to them at dawn Thursday. After 19 months of stalemate, the
American plan, a product of hundreds of conversations and many
drafts, seeks to lay out a deal by which, over 12 weeks, Israel
will redeploy in stages from 13 percent more of the West Bank _ 3
percent to be a nature reserve _ in return for specific Palestinian
steps to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans have been briefing both sides for months on
drafts of the plan, this is the first time it has been physically
handed to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the sticking points were real, however incidental they
seemed to the main bargain.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other issue _ a seaport for the Palestinians _ is
also unsettled, but need not be resolved here, since the port would
not be built for three years or so.
</P>
<P>
   During a crucial part of the evening, the Americans got both
sides to identify the issues of most importance to them. For the
Israelis, it was the charter and extradition; for the Palestinians,
the third redeployment in the West Bank and the prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, the leaders came together to go over the
progress on the main issues and take stock of what remained to be
done. Some of those issues, like security measures for an
already-built airport in Gaza, were considered minor and easily
finished, but not done yet. Other such issues were safe passage and
economic aid to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're moving,'' a senior American official said. ``But I've
watched this too long to be too optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Israeli and Palestinian officials grew increasingly
upbeat through the long and difficult day, the eighth one of a
negotiating process Rubin called ``excruciating.''
</P>
<P>
   But American interests, and the interests of the region,
required serious efforts to ``get the peace process back on track''
after the 19 months of stagnation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn the White House gave the two sides the American
compromise proposal which became a basis for Thursday's bargaining
sessions. Thursday morning Clinton said, ``The hardest decisions
are at last on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had tried to pull the two sides together
throughout the day, beginning with a lunch. Afterward, Netanyahu
and Arafat sat alone and spoke for some 20 minutes through Arafat's
translator.

VICE CHAIRMAN PLANS TO RETIRE AFTER 31 YEARS AT GOLDMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Zuckerberg, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
and the longest serving partner at the private Wall Street firm,
will retire next month _ potentially missing out on a chance to
perhaps triple the value of his stake if the firm goes public.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerberg is the largest single shareholder in Goldman. If the
firm had issued stock to the public as planned this fall, his
shares would probably have been worth more than $200 million,
people at the firm have estimated. But the share offering was
delayed because of the deterioration in financial markets and
Goldman's own profit decline. Zuckerberg said he had decided not to
wait for the public offering before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Many retired partners, called limited partners in Goldman
parlance, still have capital invested in Goldman. But their capital
is no longer treated as equity, and they will not benefit directly
from the expected increase in the value of Goldman equity when it
becomes a public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided the best thing for me in this case was to move on,''
Zuckerberg said. ``I have been here 31 years. The business has
become extraordinarily intense as it has become more globalized. I
was faced with a decision whether to sign an agreement to stay on
for another two years and decided not to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Zuckerberg helped build Goldman's
now-extensive business serving wealthy private clients. He was
instrumental in founding Goldman's private bank in Zurich and will
continue to serve as that bank's chairman. In recent years,
Zuckerberg held a variety of executive positions at the firm and
was one of the senior partners who pushed the plan to go public
after 130 years as a private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement probably signals that Goldman will not revive its
public offering immediately, though Zuckerberg made no predictions.
``I am not a forecaster, and I don't know if it will be a week, or
month or how long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerberg said he planned to serve one year as chairman of the
Securities Industry Association, a key Wall Street industry group.
And he recently bought a $7.1 million house on 11 acres in East
Hampton, with an 8-acre agricultural reserve suitable for farming
and horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have more time and can enjoy it more,'' Zuckerberg said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Beware the rehabilitation of Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with audacity and new archival information, a number of
U.S. scholars would like to rewrite the historical verdict on Sen.
McCarthy and McCarthyism. Even if his methods were reckless and his
charges often unsubstantiated, they say, his anti-Communist crusade
was well justified and far closer to the mark than his opponents
would ever admit.
</P>
<P>
   This is ideology masquerading as history. Whatever the truth
about Communist infiltration of the U.S. government during the
early years of the Cold War _ and it is now clear there was
probably more than many of McCarthy's critics would acknowledge _
McCarthyism itself was a lethal threat to American democracy and
decency.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet and U.S. intelligence archives have yielded new
information in recent years about Soviet espionage activities in
the United States, but much of it is opaque and ambiguous. The
intelligence documents rely heavily on the accounts of Russian
field agents who had a strong self-interest in chronicling the
successful recruitment of Americans. In many cases it is impossible
to know if the accounts were embellished or even accurate at all,
and the identity of the Americans is often unclear. The testimony
and memoirs of former Soviet officials are equally shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the materials leave little doubt about several of the
most prominent cases. The Kremlin did obtain critical information
about U.S. atomic weapons from a number of people, including Julius
Rosenberg, who was convicted and executed for treason along with
his wife, Ethel. Her complicity is less clear. Alger Hiss was most
likely a Soviet agent, despite his denials. Americans who long
defended Hiss should not flinch from the evidence of his betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But the appropriate response to Soviet espionage should have
been careful investigation and dispassionate prosecution under the
principles of law. Instead McCarthy saw an opportunity for
political sport and hysteria, and he exploited it with demagogic
fervor and a sickening flair for fabrication. Along the way he
trampled the civil liberties and destroyed the careers of hundreds
of Americans, many of them innocent of any Communist affiliation.
The venomous Washington witch-hunt soon spread across American
society, poisoning the universities, the arts, the press and many
other professions.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthyism was not patriotism and must never be mistaken as
such. It was a menace to the body politic. A reconsideration of
Communist influence in America at midcentury is fair enough as new
information is disclosed. But elevating McCarthy and his methods
would be repugnant and historically dishonest.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Massimo D'Alema, who heads Italy's former Communist Party, seems
likely to win parliamentary confirmation as prime minister, making
him the first ex-Communist to lead a major West European country.
But Washington, which worked hard during the Cold War to exclude
Italian Communists from government, has little to worry about.
D'Alema would lead a coalition that ranges further right than the
last Italian government. He is likely to continue the conservative
fiscal policies that have sharply reduced Italy's budget deficits
and qualified it to join Europe's new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema would succeed Romano Prodi, a centrist economist who
lost a confidence vote this month. The Prodi government's strongest
supporter was the Democratic Party of the Left, the name the
Communists adopted when they renounced Marxism in 1991. That makes
D'Alema a logical choice to lead a new government committed to
continued fiscal discipline. But it is not clear if he will be able
to manage a coalition ranging from unreformed Communists to
Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond budgets, the main issues of Italian politics include
reforming the Constitution to promote more stable government,
prosecuting corruption and resisting northern separatism. D'Alema
has a good record on these issues. Giving him a chance to lead
seems a reasonable step.  &QL;

`ROMEO AND JULIET': TRAGEDIES ENTWINED, THE LITERARY AND THE
LITERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj set his
1990 ``Romeo and Juliet'' in a police state. At the Brooklyn
Academy of Music, where this highly theatrical and updated version
of a well-known tale is retold with alternating grimness and
luminous beauty, the Berlin wall still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's famous balcony is now a catwalk patrolled by a
watchtower guard with a real German shepherd on a leash. Below, a
waif of a Juliet in bare legs and a ragged Romeo discover love with
the instinctive movements of young animals in a mating rite.
</P>
<P>
   The society around them has forgotten how to love. The Capulets
are the oppressors of the Montagues, the underclass. In a striking
scene that distills Preljocaj's twist on the entire story, the
Capulet women mechanically caress their immobile robotlike partners
as they pass from man to man. In this regimented society, only
Romeo and Juliet are free spirits, retaining atavistic feelings.
Each of their duets is stunning. Here is choreography that is never
literal but always physical.
</P>
<P>
   When Nadine Comminges, as Juliet, hangs by the neck of her
Romeo, Stephane Loras, and arches so that her legs swing out into
space as he spins faster and faster, the vortex of their passion
looks overwhelming and elicits a kinesthetic response from the
audience: a burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Created just after the fall of the Berlin wall, this ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' with its overt totalitarian images, might look dated. But
then there is Kosovo, and Preljocaj, born in France in 1951 of
Albanian parents, has a larger theme in mind. The individual in a
society where order comes first is always at risk. In his version,
Tybalt is not killed; he is the dictator, looking down at a Romeo
and Juliet whose spirits are united in death.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the Ballet Preljocaj
is part of the Next Wave Festival through Saturday night, comes
late to Preljocaj. After its U.S. debut at Gould Hall in 1991, the
choreographer's company _ actually a modern dance troupe _ was seen
at the American Dance Festival, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts and the Joyce Theater. Preljocaj has also created
works for major ballet troupes. These include ``Le Parc,'' seen in
New York with the Paris Opera Ballet, and ``La Stravaganza'' for
the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Romeo and Juliet'' is another commission from a ballet
company, the Lyons Opera Ballet. But it does not use classical
technique as in the Paris Opera and City Ballet pieces. Moreover,
it offers a limited view of Preljocaj's extensive range. (Some of
the costumes have also been changed since 1990.) The Lyons dancers,
whom I saw in France, offered a commanding ``Romeo and Juliet.''
But the current leads (there is an alternating cast) are more
uninhibited in the athletic abandon that defines the choreography's
virtuosity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this instance, the ensembles are less interesting than the
duets, simply because of the images Preljocaj's police-state
conception has imposed upon the production. His two Yugoslav
collaborators, Enki Bilal for the sets, and Goran Vejvoda, whose
electronic score augments the set passages from a selective tape of
Prokofiev's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' have invented a deliberately
oppressive environment.
</P>
<P>
   Bilal's imposing set (fortress, bulwark and creviced wall) is
both futuristic and of the past. The Capulet men are helmeted
soldiers moving robotically until Tybalt (Philippe Combes) leads
them into a high leaping duel with the Montagues and a gang attack
on a dynamic Mercutio (Jose-Maria Alves).
</P>
<P>
   When the stage is invaded by nine women dressed like Juliet in
halters and shorts, this multiple vision of herself is formal but
strangely stiff. The influence of Viola Farber, one of the
choreographer's teachers and once Merce Cunningham's partner, is
often evident in Preljocaj's work. Here the women's straight-limbed
silhouettes recall Cunningham, but Cunningham-style abstraction
wedded to narrative does not always work.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the duets explain why Preljocaj is a major
choreographer. At his best, he uses movement in a new way, avoiding
narrative connotation but the physical force of every gesture or
movement distills the essence of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   When two women (Claire Burnet and Barbara Sarreau) portray two
halves of Juliet's nurse, they paw the earth. Juliet imitates them
obediently but also walks an imaginary tightrope, a symbol of her
frailty. When she intervenes to protect Mercutio from Tybalt, the
suddenness of her gesture is especially dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Comminges, stunning in her gamine presence, and Loras,
always intense, are a study in impulse in their startling balcony
duet. The symmetry of their bedroom duet on a tilted platform
follows their marriage by a space-age priest. At the wedding, they
reach out from two chairs, an image reworked throughout the
desperate tosses in the air of their final duet in the tomb. Here
is real choreography, difficult to perform but rendered with true
virtuosity.

READERS OF PERSONAL FINANCE MAGAZINES SHOULD DO EXTRA RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>

(EDS, This is a copyrighted story)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Investors should approach personal finance
magazines like they would any other source of investment advice:
with an open but inquiring mind.
</P>
<P>
   These publications are a good source of investment ideas and
company profiles, but investors should do their own research as
well, magazine editors and consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving people ideas,'' said Manny Schiffres, senior
associate editor at Kiplinger's magazine in Washington. ``We
certainly don't mean for people to take our ideas without further
research and buy that stock. ... The picks that appear in our
magazine are meant to be the starting point of the investment
process and not the ending point.''
</P>
<P>
   Since magazines don't have enough space to publish every
pertinent fact about an investment, readers should dig into it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what experts say investors should consult at the very
minimum even after reading a magazine recommendation:
</P>
<P>
   --Value Line's report on the company, which can be found at most
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   --The company's quarterly and annual earnings reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   --Pertinent news and press releases from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also should avoid trends _ like ``The Top 10 Mutual
Funds to Buy Now'' -- no matter how appealing the headline, said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that it's not easy to predict the ``best
investments,'' she said. Don't take the magazine's word for it
without checking it out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, come up with a reasonable investment plan or strategy
that fits your needs and stick to it, Roper said. In general, it's
a good idea to keep expenses down, avoid exotic investment products
and save consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Consult a trusted financial adviser if your situation is
complicated.

NORTHRIDGE HAS TURNOVER TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Cal State Northridge turned the ball over
five times last week, which most would consider the main
contributor to a brutal loss. That's not what CSUN defensive
coordinator Craig Wall saw. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   Wall was fixated on the Matadors' inability to create a
turnover, a problem CSUN needs to solve heading into Saturday's
game with Montana State at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacramento State had the ball on the ground twice and we
didn't get it,'' Wall said. ``We have to get back to doing it. We
need to run to the ball and be aggressive, and those things will
take care of themselves. When you run and hit hard you tend to take
more turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the 24th-ranked Matadors led the Big Sky Conference
in turnover ratio. Now they're fourth, having forced 11 but
committed nine. Not coincidentally, CSUN's defense is fourth in the
conference in points allowed at 21.7 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want two to three turnovers over a game,'' CSUN coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``We're not forcing enough fumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Matadors aren't getting the ones they do force,
recovering half of their opponents' 10 fumbles. Turnovers are a key
because they improve field position and lead to points. With no
turnovers last week, CSUN's best starting field position was its
own 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the offense the ball to punch it in,'' CSUN
defensive lineman Levi Line said. ``Turnovers is something that's
part of the defense. You're going to swarm to the ball, someone's
going to punch the ball out. Causing the quarterback to scramble,
it's like Christmas for the DBs because it's an opportunity for a
pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first six games, the secondary has been victimized
by the lack of a big-time defensive line, which forces it from the
interception-friendly zone defense to man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Ponciano said another factor works against the Matadors _
they lack a ``Fear of God'' hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Jeremy Golden hits hard, but he's 6-foot, 180 pounds
and doesn't deliver Mack-truck hits that leave ballcarriers
disheveled. His hits are more like from a sleek sports car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the big hitters on defense and we don't have
big hitters,'' Ponciano said. ``I don't think we're a team that's
going to get a lot of turnovers. Teams that usually get a lot of
turnovers are zone teams. If you have a stellar front and active
linebackers, you can play more zone stuff. We play a lot of man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot of turnovers when you're extremely aggressive
and physical on defense, and we are not a real physical defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors secondary is, arguably, the most talented and
deepest in the league. Yet, they've combined for five interceptions
in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a lot better,'' said cornerback Mel Miller, who's
yet to have a pick. ``I haven't had that many opportunities. I've
had a few but not that many.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: CSUN linebacker Shayne Blakey stood by an earlier
proclamation and returned to practice Thursday with a heavily taped
elbow. He will play Saturday using an elbow brace.... The Matadors
took a hit to the defensive line when nose guard Mike Colunga,
trying to return from an ankle injury, missed the last 30 minutes
of practice. His availability is in question.

READERS OF PERSONAL FINANCE MAGAZINES SHOULD DO EXTRA RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Investors should approach personal finance
magazines like they would any other source of investment advice:
with an open but inquiring mind.
</P>
<P>
   These publications are a good source of investment ideas and
company profiles, but investors should do their own research as
well, magazine editors and consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving people ideas,'' said Manny Schiffres, senior
associate editor at Kiplinger's magazine in Washington. ``We
certainly don't mean for people to take our ideas without further
research and buy that stock. ... The picks that appear in our
magazine are meant to be the starting point of the investment
process and not the ending point.''
</P>
<P>
   Since magazines don't have enough space to publish every
pertinent fact about an investment, readers should dig into it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what experts say investors should consult at the very
minimum even after reading a magazine recommendation:
</P>
<P>
   --Value Line's report on the company, which can be found at most
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   --The company's quarterly and annual earnings reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   --Pertinent news and press releases from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also should avoid trends _ like ``The Top 10 Mutual
Funds to Buy Now'' -- no matter how appealing the headline, said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that it's not easy to predict the ``best
investments,'' she said. Don't take the magazine's word for it
without checking it out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, come up with a reasonable investment plan or strategy
that fits your needs and stick to it, Roper said. In general, it's
a good idea to keep expenses down, avoid exotic investment products
and save consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Consult a trusted financial adviser if your situation is
complicated.

RICHARD NESSON, 66, EX-PRESIDENT OF A LEADING TEACHING HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   H. Richard Nesson, the former president of Brigham and Women's
Hospital, one of the nation's leading teaching hospitals, and a
pioneer in hospital management in the new era of health maintenance
organizations, died Oct. 18 in Boston. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Nesson suffered a heart attack while exercising, said the
hospital's current president, Jeffrey Otten. Though retired from
Brigham and Women's since 1997, Nesson remained a high-profile
figure in Boston health care until his death. Last week, for
example, he announced the creation of a program at a health center
to give women without health insurance access to cancer tests.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston native who came to view health care as a basic right,
Nesson got his bachelor of science degree from Harvard College in
1954 and completed his medical studies at Boston University where
he graduated cum laude in 1959. Nesson, who was a specialist in
kidney care, never practiced medicine privately. He taught internal
medicine at the Harvard Medical School, but by the early 1980s it
had become obvious that his true vocation lay in building and
managing an increasingly complex health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first people in the country to argue that
HMOs might actually provide better care at lower cost,'' Otten
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Nesson became president of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
Medical research expanded rapidly during Nesson's 15-year
presidency, which saw a nearly twenty-fold increase in federal
financing, to $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nesson presided over the merger of longtime rivals Brigham and
Women's and the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1993. The Harvard
Community Health Plan, by then the largest managed care
organization in the state, sent most of its inpatients there.
</P>
<P>
   He served in public service posts, including chairman of the
Massachusetts Hospital Association, a director of the Massachusetts
United Way and chairman of the Harvard Medical Center AIDS
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nesson is survived by his wife, Lois; two children, Ted and
Sara; two sisters, Marilyn Mann of Gloucester, Mass., and Lois
Cohen of Glencoe, Ill.; and two grandchildren.

MOYNIHAN ENDORSES SPITZER FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that the prestige of the state attorney
general's office had declined under Dennis Vacco, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Thursday endorsed the Democratic
challenger, Eliot Spitzer, saying he would bring energy and high
legal standards to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said that previous attorneys general going back to
Jacob Javits, a Republican, had run the office in a nonpartisan
manner and had hired first-rate lawyers. Under Vacco, however,
``the office has declined,'' the senator said, standing with
Spitzer on the steps of the main branch of the New York Public
Library on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has low visibility, which is probably just as well if you
knew what was going on,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vacco belittled the endorsement as a predictable
partisan gesture. ``Dennis Vacco has been endorsed by every law
enforcement group in the state for his leadership in the fight
against crime,'' said the spokesman, Michael Zabel, ``while Eliot
Spitzer can only get support from Democratic politicians who are
obligated to endorse him by party loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, however, has often been chided by his party for
failing to lend a hand to Democrats in New York state races.
Earlier this month, he bestowed a rare endorsement on Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., in his race against Republican Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco had only one campaign stop on his schedule Thursday, an
evening appearance on Long Island to be named honorary law
enforcement man of the year by the Nassau County Police Department
Detectives Association. That organization is one of about four
dozen law enforcement groups to endorse the Republican incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared remarks, Vacco made no mention of his
challenger, choosing to concentrate on his own accomplishments
during four years in office: a crackdown on child pornography on
the Internet, presiding over the state's first
death-penalty-eligible case since capital punishment was restored
in New York, and a series of drug arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco and Spitzer are scheduled to face each other Friday night
in their first debate, on News 12 Long Island in Woodbury, N.Y. The
taped debate will be shown on the Woodbury television stations and
on two other News 12 stations in Westchester County and in the
Bronx. The two candidates are to meet in a second debate on Sunday
_ live on WABC-TV, Channel 7 _ that will be shown statewide on some
ABC affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign in which both sides have struggled to gain public
and news media attention, Spitzer clearly hoped that Moynihan's
endorsement would gain him both votes and publicity. Moynihan said
he became involved in the campaign because the attorney general's
office had undergone so much change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important race,'' the senator said. ``This has to
do with the quality of government in New York.'' He said Spitzer
would follow the example of Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, hiring people with strong academic credentials
and experience rather than political connections. Spitzer worked
under Morgenthau as an assistant district attorney and ran that
office's labor racketeering unit in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan shied away from specifically criticizing Vacco's
performance, other than to say that the office was not what it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he felt confident that Spitzer would use the power
of the attorney general's office to take action against General
Electric Co. for failing to remove PCB contaminants from the Hudson
River. GE, which operated two factories that legally released more
than a billion pounds of PCBs into the river before such discharges
were banned in 1977, has long contended that the contaminated areas
are mostly dormant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1978, I got a $15 million appropriation to scoop up the
PCBs that General Electric has dumped in the Hudson River,''
Moynihan said. ``The $15 million has long since disappeared; the
PCBs are still there. That's government not working. People drink
that water, up and down the Hudson. No attorney general has done
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Spitzer, Moynihan added: ``He will. He knows it's
there. How he will do it, I don't know. He does.''

 ORMONDE DE KAY, 74, WRITER, POET, EDITOR AND TRANSLATOR 
</HEADLINE>

 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ormonde de Kay, a writer, poet and magazine editor,
died on Oct. 2 at Beth Israel Hospital. De Kay, who lived in
Manhattan, was 74.
</P>
<P>
   He died of lung cancer, his brother George said.
</P>
<P>
   De Kay was a versatile writer who took delight in wordplay and
language. He wrote dozens of documentaries, contributed to the
script of the highly praised 1949 film ``Lost Boundaries,'' wrote
several books that combined his affection for light verse and
French, and was the author of children's biographies of Andrew
Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lewis and Clark. He wrote articles
on history for magazines like American Heritage and Horizon, where
he was articles editor in the 1970s, and he contributed light verse
to The New Yorker, Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Rimes de la Mere Oie,'' a 1971 translation of Mother Goose
that managed to retain the meter, rhyme schemes and humor of the
English originals, was praised by Robert Graves as ``a remarkable
achievement and a great gift to the French.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and '90s, de Kay turned full time to freelance
writing. His last book, ``From the Age That Is Past,'' published in
1994, is a history of the Harvard Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
   De Kay, who was born in New York City in 1923, graduated in 1945
from Harvard College, where he was the editor of the university
literary magazine The Advocate. During World War II and the Korean
War he served aboard Navy destroyer escorts. In the late 1940s and
'50s he lived in Paris, London, Munich and Rome, writing radio and
film scripts. Later he helped to start Interplay, a magazine about
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   De Kay is survived by his wife, Barbara; a son, Thomas, of
Manhattan; two brothers, George, of Manhattan and James Tertius of
Stonington, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Lenore Roosevelt of Cudjo Key,
Fla.; and a stepson, Philip Roosevelt of Chappaqua, N.Y.

ALBERT JOHNSON, 73, SAN FRANCISCO FILM FESTIVAL PROGRAM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Johnson, a film critic and historian who, as program
director of the San Francisco International Film Festival from 1965
to 1972, was celebrated for his pioneering tributes to Hollywood
legends, died on Oct. 17 in Chicago. He was 73 and lived in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Coretta Greaux.
He was in Chicago to present an award at the Chicago Film Festival,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in Harlem, where his mother danced at the Cotton
Club and his father practiced medicine, Johnson attended the
University of California at Berkeley, majoring in English. After
graduation, he studied at Oxford University, and at the Shakespeare
Institute in Stratford, England. He began his film writing and
criticism career as a contributor to the British Film Institute's
Sight and Sound magazine, and was its U.S. editor for 10 years
after his return to California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Johnson became the program director of the San
Francisco International Film Festival, where he introduced works by
the foreign directors Andrzej Wadja, Nicholas Ray, Lina Wertmuller,
Bernardo Bertolucci and Volker Schlondorff to U.S. audiences. He
also initiated what was to become standard festival fare in the
form of tributes to screen luminaries. By 1980, he had become the
festival's artistic director, but resigned after a season during
which, he said, ``commercial interests undermined artistic
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, Johnson was a member of the department of
African-American studies at Berkeley, where he introduced courses
on third-world cinema and ``Images of Minorities in the American
Cinema.'' But it was his course on the American musical film that
earned him his reputation as a compelling lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   True to the lessons learned from his mother, Johnson was a
performer, introducing his lectures with a song _ and sometimes, a
dance _ from the musical being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like magic when he entered a room,'' said Edith Kramer,
the film curator and director of the university's Pacific Film
Archives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, of Sunrise, Fla., he is survived by a
brother, Jesse Jenkins Jr. of New York.

 RANDOLPH CARTER, 90, BROADWAY PLAYWRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randolph Carter, an author who wrote several plays
produced on Broadway, died on Monday at St. Albans Naval Hospital
in Queens. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's first Broadway production was ``Arms of Venus'' (1937),
based on Petronius' ``Satyricon.'' Variety called it ``a tempest in
a Roman tomb'' and ``an orgy of laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was associated with J.J. Shubert for 10 years, serving as
a play doctor and providing dialogue for a wide variety of musicals
and operettas including ``The Student Prince,'' ``Countess
Maritza,'' ``The Land of Smiles'' and ``The Merry Widow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Broadway productions included a dramatization of
``Wuthering Heights'' in 1940 and ``Eugenia,'' starring Tallulah
Bankhead, in 1957. His ``Florence Nightingale,'' starring Katharine
Cornell, was presented on radio in 1951 by the Theater Guild on the
Air.
</P>
<P>
   He also adapted ``Wuthering Heights'' for a television
production that starred Richard Burton and Claire Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 his adaptation of James T. Farrell's ``Death of Nora
Ryan'' was presented off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1969 Carter was the drama critic on the John
Wingate news program on WOR-TV.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``The World of Flo Ziegfeld'' (1974) and a
monograph, ``Joseph Urban'' (1992).

CITY'S HAITIANS DIVIDED ON DEPORTING MAN TIED TO MURDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly four years, many Haitians in New York have
been united in their resolve to have the United States extradite
Emmanuel Constant, the former leader of a right-wing paramilitary
group, so that he can face charges in Haiti that he killed and
tortured thousands of people there.
</P>
<P>
   But as Constant continues to live on a quiet street in
Laurelton, Queens, serious divisions have emerged over the wisdom
of sending back a man who symbolizes to many Haitians the brutality
of the time when the military ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some Haitians in New York are now suggesting that Haiti is
racked by too many problems, and question whether its fragile legal
system could prosecute such a high-profile case.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been fueled by the emergence of a surprising
opponent to his deportation: Arlette Belance, a street food vendor
whose arm was cut off and who was left for dead on a roadside in
Haiti after a bloody coup ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
in 1991. Four years later, about 20,000 foreign troops invaded
Haiti and restored Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belance, 38, who now lives in New Jersey, noted that she
still had family in Haiti, and said that Constant was a bigger
threat there than here, although she said she still believed that
he should be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending him back is not a solution,'' Ms. Belance said. ``It's
only symbolic and we can't assure that he will face justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is raging among Haitians even as the City Council
voted unanimously Thursday to put pressure on the U.S. government
to extradite or deport Constant to stand trial in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   During the City Council's hearings, Ms. Belance did not testify,
underscoring the rift that the Constant case has created among the
500,000 Haitians in the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belance's arguments echo those made by State Department and
Immigration officials in refusing to return Constant to Haiti
despite the Haitian government's extradition request three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After she was found near death in Haiti, photographs of Ms.
Belance appeared on front pages of newspapers around the world,
calling attention to the brutality of the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, she said she had become disenchanted with the
Center for Constitutional Rights _ which aggressively lobbied the
City Council to pass Thursday's resolution _ because the group had
used her picture for fund-raising without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that they have their own political agenda that does
not have anything to do with the realities of Haiti,'' Ms. Belance
said in Creole during a telephone interview in Canada. ``I don't
want them using my pictures in their brochures. I don't support
their cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, said that the principal question was whether Constant
should remain free.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Haitian government officials think they can
handle this case,'' Ratner said. ``Why should I second-guess
them?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Constant, 42, the son of a military officer, spent part of his
career as a diplomat, assigned to Haiti's U.N. mission. But in
1993, he emerged as the leader of a shadowy group, the Front for
the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, that is believed responsible
for the torture and killings of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after United States troops raided his headquarters
in Port-au-Prince, the capital, Constant was allowed to enter the
United States on a tourist visa. He was arrested by immigration
officials in 1995 but appealed for political asylum and was
released a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Ricot Dupuy, manager of Radio Soleil d'Haiti in Flatbush,
Brooklyn, said he supported sending Constant back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of Toto Constant living free in New York, the
bastion of the Haitian diaspora, is definitely one of the biggest
insults to Haitians here,'' Dupuy said. ``I don't know any other
ethnic groups in New York that would have been dealt this insult.''

Charity game lures star-studded field

</P>
<P>
   With their usual places of employment locked, NBA stars will
play in the Gallery Furniture Charity Basketball Game tonight at
Hofheinz Pavilion, and will be paid as much as $10,000 apiece for
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Players, available because of the NBA lockout during the impasse
in negotiations for a new collective-bargaining agreement, will be
paid an appearance fee, game organizer Linda McIngvale said, of ``a
couple thousand dollars.'' Several agents and participating players
said appearance fees will go as high as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Players with ``love of the game'' clauses in contracts are
permitted to play in charity and recreational events, but an injury
in a game for payment could void a contract after the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Game organizers also have purchased group insurance, will assume
all expenses and chartered a jet to bring players from the National
Basketball Players Association meetings in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Players expected to participate include Anfernee Hardaway,
Robert Horry, Mitch Richmond, Sam Cassell, Nick Van Exel, Avery
Johnson and Ray Allen. Tim Duncan and David Robinson are expected
to attend but have not confirmed they will play. Bulls forward
Scottie Pippen had planned to play, but did not receive medical
clearance. Celtics forward Antoine Walker was a late addition to
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rockets guards Kenny Smith and Clyde Drexler, now the
University of Houston coach, will coach the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a couple surprise players,'' McIngvale said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets at the $40 and $50 levels are available from
Ticketmaster. All ticket proceeds will go to the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center.

   LOS ANGELES _ Just what are readers buying?
</P>
<P>
   Personal finance magazines offer their readers the stock
recommendations of Wall Street pundits like star mutual fund
managers, plus investment picks from the magazine's editors and
reporters. Then there are the company profiles and interviews with
executives, among other stories.
</P>
<P>
   Experts of Wall Street featured in these publications have to
possess a stellar investment record before any national magazine
gives them ink. But that's not the case with the magazines' own
journalists who often step into the role of investment guru.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at Money, SmartMoney and Kiplinger's said they and their
staff carry years of financial reporting experience that equip them
to make good recommendations. (Worth did not comment.) For an
expert opinion, they also might bounce ideas off proven fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
   But most don't have either a formal education in finance, such
as an MBA or college business degree, or credentials such as a
certified financial planner designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what qualifies a person to analyze stocks,''
said Jersey Gilbert, financial editor for SmartMoney magazine in
New York. He argues that a business degree does not guarantee great
stock picking. Instead, SmartMoney recruits reporters with
analytical skills and trains them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Schiffres, senior associate editor at Kiplinger's magazine
in Washington, said he's been writing about personal finance since
the mid-1980s and feels ``very comfortable with my abilities in
this area'' especially ``in a world filled with 28-year-old fund
managers.'' He also consults with mutual fund managers he holds in
high regard, those with proven track records.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Consumer Reports' financial editor Lou Richman has
an MBA and so do three of his four financial writers. The magazine
is more a consumer advocacy publication than a traditional business
news publication.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richman says that while it helps to have an MBA,
journalists don't have to possess a business degree to do their
jobs well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are personal finance journalists who have been
covering the industry for so long that they've learned a lot, said
Barbara Levin, executive director of Forum For Investor Advice, a
nonprofit group in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``there's no guarantee these people know what they're
talking about. They don't have to have a history of success,'' said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Bryant Quinn of Newsweek, one of the most famous personal
finance columnists in America, frowns on journalists becoming stock
pickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reporters today are ... turning themselves into financial
advisers by picking, or promoting, mutual fund and stocks in print
_ trading on their credibility as a disinterested source,'' she
wrote in the March/April 1998 issue of the Columbia Journalism
Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We justify it by saying `Better us than a stock salesperson.
Besides, look how our stocks or funds have soared,''' she wrote.
``What kind of geniuses will we be when stocks go down?'' &UR; !end! &QL;

RULING ENDS SOME MARIJUANA STING OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ruling that will limit the way police departments conduct
some sting operations involving marijuana, the State Court of
Appeals in Albany, N.Y., Thursday reversed a Monroe County Court
decision that allowed people who believed they were buying
marijuana to be charged with criminal solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved 54 defendants who bought small amounts of what
they believed to be marijuana, but which was actually oregano, from
police officers in Rochester, N.Y., who were acting as drug
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Because undercover officers are not allowed to sell real
marijuana, the buyers could not be charged with possession of
marijuana, a violation that carries a maximum fine of $100.
Instead, they were charged with criminal solicitation, which
carries a maximum sentence of 15 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals ruled that they could not be charged with
criminal solicitation because of an exemption in the penal code
that states ``a person is not guilty of criminal solicitation when
his solicitation constitutes conduct of a kind that is necessarily
incidental to the commission of the crime solicited.''
</P>
<P>
   David Steinberg, chief assistant public defender in Dutchess
County, said, ``Basically it's a legal exemption, a defense to a
charge of criminal solicitation, when the conduct complained of is
part and parcel to the commission of the crime that is being
solicited.'' Steinberg is now appealing a criminal solicitation
conviction in a reverse sting case in which his client tried to buy
crack cocaine from an undercover officer in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling spells an end to reverse sting operations
involving marijuana, according to Thomas Rainbow Morse, an
assistant district attorney who represented the state, but not to
all reverse sting drug operations. Other drugs carry higher
penalties than marijuana. Although cocaine buyers may no longer be
charged with criminal solicitation, they can be charged with
attempted possession of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempted possession of marijuana is not an offense,'' said
Edward Nowak, the Monroe County public defender, who represented
the 54 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Morse said he was not giving up and that he hoped to change the
criminal solicitation statute. ``We're going to move the halls of
justice to the corridors of the Legislature,'' he said. ``We hope
to find a sponsor in the next session of the Legislature.''

NBA PLAYERS TAKE HARD LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In this glitzy resort town surrounded by desert, NBA
players stood together Thursday and drew a line in the sand:
</P>
<P>
   They will not accept the league's call for a hard salary cap,
even if it means canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   Some 240 players voted unanimously to reject outright the salary
system favored by commissioner David Stern and NBA owners. And they
pledged to do whatever it takes to resist it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes right down to it, and there's either a hard salary
cap or no season, we voted no season,'' said Lakers guard Derek
Fisher. ``In no way, shape or form are we going to agree to a hard
salary cap. It won't be beneficial to anyone in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting, which included everyone from megastars
Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and Karl Malone to the most
obscure role players, came on the 114th day of the lockout imposed
by NBA owners.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of regular-season games have already been canceled,
for the first time in league history. The rest of November's slate
will be called off next week. And players and owners have never
seemed so far apart in their battle over a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   But now, sending a single, clear message to owners, the players
hope to return to the negotiating table emboldened by a new
bargaining chip: unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we established that we're going to stick together
through this thing,'' said Lakers forward Corie Blount.
</P>
<P>
   Union chief Billy Hunter said he wants all 400-plus NBA players
to fly to New York next week to meet with commissioner David Stern
and the league's 29 owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be willing to do it with as many players as they'd like
to bring,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in response.
``We'll meet with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, meeting is the easy part. Compromise is the missing
element here.
</P>
<P>
   Owners want a hard salary cap to replace the current system,
which has numerous loopholes. Players see no reason to give up what
they've gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about ripping it up and starting over from
scratch, that's not fair,'' said Jordan, who might be retiring.
``My reason for being here is because I owe an obligation to the
young players and I owe an obligation to the players who came
before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Players believe the owners' strategy has been to divide and
conquer, playing the classes against each other until the lower
classes break ranks. And there were recent signs that might be
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's Muggsy Bogues and Detroit's Jerome Williams had
questioned the union's motives and strategy. And agent Steve Woods,
who represents Toronto center Kevin Willis, filed a grievance
against the players union, accusing it of mismanaging negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Woods told Hunter he was withdrawing the
complaint. Bogues emerged from the meeting echoing the unity theme.
</P>
<P>
   The players' goal is to retain the exceptions that allow for
Jordan's $35 million contract while also boosting the lower
classes, who make as little as $272,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, top-scale players are pledging to financially
assist their lower-paid union mates as the lockout drags on. Hunter
said 100 to 120 players will donate their annual $50,000
licensing-rights checks to create a fund for players who need it.
</P>
<P>
   Players have already lost an estimated $100 million, a figure
that will double soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to make sure that everybody is taken care of,
especially the veteran guys,'' said Bulls guard Scottie Pippen.
``That money is not even important to us right now. What's
important is that we get the right deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the middle- and lower-salary players were moved by
speeches from stars Jordan, Malone and David Robinson during the
closed-door four-hour players meeting. Players also got a double
dose of perspective from baseball union head Donald Fehr _ who
advised staying unified _ and NFL union chief Gene Upshaw, who
advocated decertifying the union.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has threatened to cancel the season if necessary. That
decision could come as soon as mid-December, if the commissioner
sticks to his previous statement that the NBA should not play any
fewer than 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Arn Tellem practically dared Stern to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants a hard cap, David Stern shouldn't wait until
Dec.15 to cancel the season. He should go ahead and cancel it
now,'' Tellem said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that might happen, Hunter used a more hopeful tone. ``I
would think that David Stern wouldn't be that foolish.''

RADIO STATION CRITICIZED FOR DRUG, SEX TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CLANCY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's called ``Party Radio,'' but unless your parties include
``Hits From the'' ``Bong'' and ``South Park Bitch,'' it is unlike
any party you ever attended.
</P>
<P>
   KPTY-FM (103.9) since June has let fly with sex and drug
references aimed squarely at a high school- and college-age
audience. Some listeners say the station is most popular with an
even younger and more impressionable audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the attention-getting business,'' says Mark Waters,
the station's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to attract attention got so raucous that the
station's best-known personality, the deejay known as Super Snake,
left in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started giving away bongs (water pipes typically
used to smoke marijuana), that was it for me,'' he said. Snake
currently is not on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Station management denies that it promotes drug use, but agrees
that it is doing what it can to get noticed by its target audience.
</P>
<P>
   KPTY may be just another player in a radio environment that
includes the often raw sexual advice of Loveline on KUPD-FM (97.9),
the extreme sex-oriented antics of Howard Stern on KEDJ-FM (106.3)
and the double-entendre humor of almost every FM deejay in town.
Even Beth and Bill, morning hosts on KESZ-FM (99.9), have played
``music'' by an artist known as ``Mr. Methane.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of Stern, whose local audience tends to
be older, KPTY probably is the only station that is making a point
of using frequent sex and drug references.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since a (Valley) station rocked the boat
like the Party,'' said Waters, who conveys a businesslike attitude
much like that of other radio general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Some listeners smell something more ominous than merely
``rocking the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Huey of Phoenix said he has a 13-year-old daughter and has
forbidden the station in his home _ ``not because of the song
selections (some of which are risque), but because of the apparent
station policy of pro drugs and pro sex, as expressed by the
deejays.''
</P>
<P>
   Several program elements reflect the apparent pro-drug tilt. A
frequently played song is Cypress Hill's ``Hits From the Bong.''
The morning show, hosted by a man called Big Mama, is called ``Wake
and Bake,'' a reference to smoking marijuana. The station for a
while did a bit called ``Chronic Calls,'' in which callers were
supposed to act high on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The message comes in light of a recent survey that reported one
in six Arizona youths used illegal drugs, especially marijuana, in
the past month, a rate that is one-third higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in any way supporting the use of drugs,'' program
director Byron Kennedy said. ``But we realize that drugs are part
of kids' lives. We are dealing with their attitudes, things they
deal with every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Greg Carlin of Scottsdale's Drug Abuse Resistance
Education program said he uses several songs the station plays in
talks to parents and community groups about how music might be a
negative influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with a lot of the songs and a lot of what they
do. It can send the wrong message to kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ward, who works with drug-addicted young people as
clinical director at Valle del Sol, said parents also could write
to advertisers. Among them are Bank One, Footlocker, AirTouch
Cellular, Mobil and Health Choice, a health insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Roman, Bank One Arizona's senior vice president of
corporate relations, said the bank's ads were placed from the
national Hispanic Marketing Group, which has an eye on a station's
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buy is done by people who don't know the content,'' he
said. ``If the content is way out of the mainstream, we would have
to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters said that no matter what parents do, advertisers want his
audience _ ``tomorrow's consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug references are part of the station's attempt to
have ``a distinct difference in presentation'' from its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that he gets at least two calls a day from
concerned or angry parents. He tells them that people have a
variety of opinions, and that they can register theirs by turning
off the station.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added, ``We're your radio station, not your role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates radio
broadcasts, fined the station last spring for playing a song with
explicit sexual references. Waters said that the station has
changed formats since then, and that the station is careful to
bleep certain words in songs. The FCC does not consider drug
references to be in violation of its broadcast standards.
</P>
<P>
   The station, which debuted in May 1997, is owned by New Planet
Radio, a small company that operates a similar station in Hawaii.
The success of that station, which made a rapid climb into the Top
10, led to the adoption of the format in Phoenix. Stations in
Tampa, Fla., Baltimore and Miami are tailoring the format to their
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The music format includes hip-hop and rap, a good dose of
alternative hits and some novelty songs, which Waters calls
``identifiers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the identifiers is the marijuana song ``Hits From the
Bong.'' Others, chosen for their ability to grab the ear of a
college student, are:
</P>
<P>
   ``ICP Clown Mix'' by Insane Clown Posse. The rap duo had its
latest album shelved by the record company (through the orders of
parent company Disney) for obscenity and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park Bitch,'' from the Comedy Central TV program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detachable Penis,'' by King Missile. A spoken ``song'' with
limited comedic value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary to hear 12-year-olds calling up asking for
``Detachable Penis'','' said Eric Stein of Peoria, an occasional
listener.
</P>
<P>
   Recent ratings seem to indicate that the station is on the wrong
track.
</P>
<P>
   With ratings dropping from 3.2 to 1.5 during the life of the
Party, the station has lost more than 30,000 listeners, and the
time the remaining 160,500 spend listening is 4 hours 15 minutes a
week, down from 7 hours, according to the Arbitron Co., which
measures radio audiences. &QL;

DODGERS, JOHNSON AGREE ON 3-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Less than two hours after landing in Los Angeles
Thursday night, Davey Johnson became the new Dodgers manager.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to take a little longer to turn around a club
that has been lethargic during most of this decade, but Johnson's
resume for quickly building winners includes one World Series
championship and five division titles in 10 years as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   During dinner with Dodgers president Bob Graziano and general
manager Kevin Malone on Thursday, Johnson accepted a three-year
deal believed to be worth $4.5 million, the same offer the club
made to Montreal's Felipe Alou two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has the highest winning percentage (.575) among
active major-league managers, becomes the Dodgers' fifth manager
during 40 years in L.A. but third in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Glenn Hoffman, who took over last June for fired
Bill Russell. Hoffman has been retained as a coach with Johnson,
who is expected to name his staff quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It all will be made official this afternoon at a 1:30 p.m. news
conference at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to comment until then,'' Malone said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's new team finished a disappointing 83-79 in 1998 and
third in the National League West. He has a reputation as a
players' manager who is effective handling a pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers payroll is expected to climb beyond $70
million next season, $53 million already is committed to 12
players.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's hiring is expected to be the first of many Dodgers
announcements this offseason. The team finished last in the league
in on-base percentage and Malone has said fixing that is the club's
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey is an innovator,'' Malone said after Johnson interviewed
for the job last Saturday in New York. ``He gets the most out of
his teams. His presence is felt all over an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hired Johnson less than a week before the front
office heads to the club's spring-training base in Vero Beach, Fla.
for five days of organizational meetings. From there Malone flies
to Naples, Fla., for the annual three-day gathering of baseball's
general managers.
</P>
<P>
   It is there Malone will begin to reshape his club. He has said
the Dodgers will not pursue San Diego's free-agent right-hander
Kevin Brown, who might command upwards of $12 million a year on the
open market. He also will check the level of interest in third
baseman Bobby Bonilla, whose trade value is crippled by $11.8
million left on his contract. Second baseman Eric Young also will
be shopped.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Graziano returned early Thursday after attending the
end of the World Series in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who also interviewed former Texas and Boston manager
Kevin Kennedy for the job, called the club's new owners at Fox at 8
a.m. with his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was an assistant to Baltimore general manager Pat Gillick
when Johnson led the Orioles to back-to-back playoff seasons.
Malone has denied reports that their relationship was strained.
Johnson, however, did have personality clashes with Baltimore's
ego-driven owner Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also managed in Cincinnati in 1995 and led the Reds to a
NL Central title and a sweep of the Dodgers in the first round of
the playoffs. He left there after a conflict with another
high-profile owner, Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might be luckier in Los Angeles. Dodgers new owner
Rupert Murdoch rarely attends games. But he does expect to win.

MAGAZINE STOCK PICKS OFTEN FAIL TO PAY OFF

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You see them at nearly every bookstore and corner newsstand:
personal finance magazines touting the best investments or the
hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With the subtlety of a 30-minute infomercial, the magazines
scream to readers the promise of investment success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best Mid-Year Investments'' declared a SmartMoney article in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Stocks Pegged to Earn 47%'' within the next year, promised
Money magazine in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But how good are these recommendations? Not very, based on a
Daily News review.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper tracked the yearlong performance of 141 stocks
recommended in 21 articles in issues of four popular personal
finance publications. Seventy-three stocks out of the 141 -- or 52
percent -- lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Forget earning 47 percent or even modest returns; more than half
of the stocks recommended in some articles by some of the nation's
most popular personal finance magazines cost their readers money.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned is that readers ought to beware -- even
when the advice comes from some of the best-known magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The articles ran in the April 1997 to January 1998 editions and
were selected randomly to gauge the yearlong performance of stocks
through last year's bull market and this summer's bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that not every investment recommendation we make will
work out,'' admitted Bob Safian, managing editor at Money magazine
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that even among professional investors ``if they
have slightly more winners than losers, they are stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazines' record is surprising, considering that most of
the stock picks were made in a market that by almost every measure
was hugely profitable. The findings are a cause for concern because
millions of investors -- through self-directed individual
retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and personal accounts -- have
funneled billions into the stock market in recent years, relying on
personal finance magazines like Money, SmartMoney, Kiplinger's and
Worth for advice.
</P>
<P>
   If those magazines' readers had bought into index funds that
tracked the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index on the first day of that
month's issue instead of buying the magazines' picks, the investors
would have made as much as 45.88 percent (before fund fees and
without reinvesting dividends). If they had bought at the worst
possible day during that time, they still would have made 3.24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the stock recommendations against five indexes (S&AMP;P
500, S&AMP;P Midcap 400, Russell 2000, MicroCap 50 and Wilshire 5000
indexes) that better reflect the market segments of these
securities, the magazines did even worse. Eighty-two out of 141
stocks, or 58 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   For Money magazine, 23 out of 39 stock picks -- or 59 percent --
did not beat their market segment. Seventy-four percent (20 out of
27 stocks) of SmartMoney's picks did not beat the appropriate
indexes. Eleven out of 20 stocks (55 percent) touted by Kiplinger's
lost to comparable indexes. As for Worth, 28 out of 55 stocks, or
51 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   If you took the average return per article, excluding dividends,
and compared the result with a comparable index, 56 percent of
Money magazine's articles did not beat the market. SmartMoney had a
75 percent miss, half of Worth's articles did not beat the indexes
and none of Kiplinger's articles outpaced the market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's not easy to beat the market. Most mutual fund
managers don't do better than the S&AMP;P 500. Some of the stock picks
in the articles performed well over 12 months but still didn't
outpace the market.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's April 1997 issue recommended buying Chase Manhattan,
which rose 42 percent in a year. But that didn't beat the S&AMP;P 500's
45.88 percent gain over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't much better even if the yardstick is simple
profitability -- whether a stock increased after a year (or, in the
case of the January 1998 special issue, nine months).
</P>
<P>
   Using this yardstick, 18 of 39 individual stocks recommended by
Money from June to August 1997, or 46 percent, lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the performance of all recommendations by article,
three out of nine Money stories showed negative returns -- a 33
percent miss.
</P>
<P>
   However, Money made a good call in an August 1997 article,
``Don't Just Sit There ... Sell Stock Now.'' Investors who acted on
it would have avoided the October 1997 correction and the current
bear market -- providing they put the money in cash, money market
accounts or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If someone followed the magazine's advice and bought stocks
recommended in other articles in the same issue, the results
would've been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, $1,000 invested in each of five stocks recommended
in ``Defend your portfolio with stocks that promise income and
growth,'' would have made $1,345, or 28 percent, in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But if someone bought $1,000 worth of each stock recommended as
hedges against inflation that also was in the same issue, he would
have lost $1,247 a year later, or 26 percent. Indeed, four out of
the five picks were losers.
</P>
<P>
   As for SmartMoney, 16 out of 27 stocks recommended in the May,
July and October 1997 issues, or 59 percent, lost money. If each of
the four articles examined was tallied separately, half had
declines.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiplinger's April and August 1997 issues, four out of 20
stocks lost money -- a 20 percent miss. One out of four articles
(25 percent) lost money. As for Worth's June 1997, September 1997
and January 1998 issues, 35 out of 55 stocks lost ground (64
percent) and three out of four articles (75 percent) showed losses.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Gilbert, financial editor for SmartMoney in New York,
contends that one year is not enough time to determine a stock's
success. If an investor waits at least five years, ``75 to 80
percent'' of SmartMoney's stock picks will make money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's ``preaches long-term investing'' of at least three
to five years, said Manny Schiffres, senior associate editor in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many stories from his and other magazines remind readers about
the long-term nature of their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not always clear how long an investor has to wait
before the investment produces a competitive return, noted Lou
Richman, financial editor at Yonkers, N.Y.-based Consumer Reports
magazine, which publishes a mutual fund issue once a year.

 McCAIN TO OFFER BILLS FIGHTING BUDGET PORK  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Arizona is tallying up the benefits it gained
under a budget package approved this week, one of the state's top
politicians is calling for legislative changes that may make it
harder for states to get federal goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Senate's foremost pork buster, said he
will introduce legislation next year to put the nation on a
biennial budget, allowing members to debate issues without
distraction for at least one year of the two-year sessions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was highly critical of the omnibus budget legislation,
saying in a floor speech that it ``makes a mockery'' of the role of
Congress in fiscal matters.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't spare his own state. More than half of the items
with Arizona's name on them were listed by McCain as pork.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona projects included:
</P>
<P>
   $500,000 to move U.S. Agricultural Research Service facilities
from the 48th Street and Broadway Road area of Phoenix to just
outside the town of Maricopa.
</P>
<P>
   $3.35 million for Arizona, Hawaii, Mississippi, Massachusetts
and South Carolina for shrimp aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
   $9 million for the Southwest Border States Anti-Drug Information
System.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million for the Arizona Methamphetamine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   $2 million to the National Park Service for improvements to Lake
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   $2 million for land acquisition at Sahuaro National Park.
</P>
<P>
   $3 million to purchase the Bar T Bar ranch near Flagstaff for
use as a park.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million for transportation projects in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   $4 million for Phoenix buses and bus facilities.
</P>
<P>
   $2 million for Tucson for alternative-fuel buses.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million for Tucson for an intermodal facility.
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp, border, meth, bus and transportation money made
McCain's list by employing the criteria he uses to determine
wasteful government spending.
</P>
<P>
   These are the McCain criteria: The project was not included in
the president's budget; it was earmarked for a specific site or
research facility; it circumvented competitive bidding; it was not
germane to its section of the budget; it involved a transfer of
federal property that got around established procedure; and it was
a new item, never considered in the congressional budget process.
</P>
<P>
   McCain even singled out as pork a project favored by fellow
Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl _ the $1 million for the
methamphetamine-interdiction effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it in there,'' said Kyl, who said he's not offended that
McCain put it on his list. He and McCain see eye-to-eye on the
problems with the omnibus bill _ that it was cobbled together
behind closed doors and laden with special projects. Both Arizona
senators voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this stuff, all of this stuff or none of this stuff
may end up being meritorious,'' said Ann Sauer, McCain's
legislative director. ``It's the process we disagree with. It's
hard to determine what a project is, let alone what its merits
are.'`
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said the meth money is important. It funds a pilot project
to train and equip local law enforcement officers to deal with the
expensive removal and cleanup of hazardous meth labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I would have liked to see a more robust program in
other states as well,'' Kyl said. But McCain is right to list it
until he has full information about it, he added. ``I understand
the basis on which he did this . . . I'll bet you 80 percent (of
McCain's list) will turn out to be pork by any definition.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most picked-on project that state received money
for is shrimp farming. McCain and others have scoffed at the idea
of raising shrimp in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   However, UA researcher Dr. Donald Lightner, an authority on
shrimp diseases, will get $310,000 to identify shrimp diseases and
devise ways to diagnose them. &QL;

Los Angeles: ``a year.'' Peter Finch, executive editor of SmartMoney, believes readers
understand that when his magazine writes about the ``best
investments of 1998, we're certainly hoping they will be the best
performing out there, but we don't have a crystal ball. We're
selling you our best investment ideas.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   But when a story promises ``The Best Midyear Investments for
1998,'' as SmartMoney did, the implication is that readers will get
results in six months, not six years.
</P>
<P>
   Why would magazines whose editors believe in long-term investing
use headlines that promise short-term gratification?
</P>
<P>
   ``The more immediate you make it, with more numbers, the more
attractive it is,'' said Samir Husni, head of the magazine program
at the University of Mississippi at Oxford who publishes a guide to
new consumer magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience wants immediate recommendations: What should I
buy now?''
</P>
<P>
   Readers take 2.5 seconds to decide whether to pick up a
magazine, he said, so publishers must grab attention.
</P>
<P>
   And readers are biting in droves. Money magazine has annual
sales of 1.9 million issues, Kiplinger's has 1.1 million,
SmartMoney commands 700,000 and Worth has 540,000.
</P>
<P>
   Personal finance magazines have flourished. There are at least
20 publications now compared to fewer than six a decade ago, Husni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing competition, Money magazine recently
chose to tone down under the leadership of Safian, its newly
installed managing editor, beginning with its October issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sorts of headlines are no longer in the magazine --
(such as) `We'll make up to 67 percent this year,' '' he said.
``We're working hard not to promise things we can't deliver. We
want readers to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiffres prefers more conservative headlines as well: ``In
general, it's better not to build up expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman doesn't like blaring headlines and avoids them in
Consumer Reports. ``We don't do it because we think it's
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   SmartMoney's Gilbert said readers know headlines carry a certain
exaggeration, balanced by a more conservative tone in the article.
``Readers understand that there's a certain hyperbole built in
because the publication wants to catch your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Crippen, a 70-year-old animated-film producer who
lives in Winnetka, disagrees. He bought four stocks two years ago
that were recommended by an investment magazine and lost money on
all. ``I thought they knew what they were doing. You figure that
they are smarter than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he understand that hyperbole was built into the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I buy something if I thought they were exaggerating?
I just want it straight. Don't play it up to get me to buy the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which isn't to say personal finance magazines aren't
useful.
</P>
<P>
   They're good resources for checking out investment
recommendations proffered by your financial adviser, said Barbara
Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation
of America in Washington. The publications also offer investment
ideas that readers should further investigate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Readers benefit from research conducted by personal finance
magazines, which have the time, resources and executive-level
contacts most individual investors don't have in order to properly
screen a company, said Safian of Money.
</P>
<P>
   Readers don't need hyped headlines and magazines can succeed
without them. Just look at Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's annual mutual fund issue is one of the most
popular covers among its 4.5 million subscribers. On the
newsstands, it's also one of the best sellers, Richman said.
</P>
<P>
   But headline hype isn't the cause. This year's spring issue was
entitled ``Funds &AMP; Gains.'' Last year? ``Mutual Funds You Can Live
With.''

   ``Six Stocks Pegged to Earn 47%'' within the next year, promised
Money magazine in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But how good are these recommendations? Not very, based on a
Daily News review.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper tracked the yearlong performance of 141 stocks
recommended in 21 articles in issues of four popular personal
finance publications. Seventy-three stocks out of the 141 -- or 52
percent -- lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Forget earning 47 percent or even modest returns; more than half
of the stocks recommended in some articles by some of the nation's
most popular personal finance magazines cost their readers money.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned is that readers ought to beware -- even
when the advice comes from some of the best-known magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The articles ran in the April 1997 to January 1998 editions and
were selected randomly to gauge the yearlong performance of stocks
through last year's bull market and this summer's bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that not every investment recommendation we make will
work out,'' admitted Bob Safian, managing editor at Money magazine
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that even among professional investors ``if they
have slightly more winners than losers, they are stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazines' record is surprising, considering that most of
the stock picks were made in a market that by almost every measure
was hugely profitable. The findings are a cause for concern because
millions of investors -- through self-directed individual
retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and personal accounts -- have
funneled billions into the stock market in recent years, relying on
personal finance magazines like Money, SmartMoney, Kiplinger's and
Worth for advice.
</P>
<P>
   If those magazines' readers had bought into index funds that
tracked the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index on the first day of that
month's issue instead of buying the magazines' picks, the investors
would have made as much as 45.88 percent (before fund fees and
without reinvesting dividends). If they had bought at the worst
possible day during that time, they still would have made 3.24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the stock recommendations against five indexes (S&AMP;P
500, S&AMP;P Midcap 400, Russell 2000, MicroCap 50 and Wilshire 5000
indexes) that better reflect the market segments of these
securities, the magazines did even worse. Eighty-two out of 141
stocks, or 58 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   For Money magazine, 23 out of 39 stock picks -- or 59 percent --
did not beat their market segment. Seventy-four percent (20 out of
27 stocks) of SmartMoney's picks did not beat the appropriate
indexes. Eleven out of 20 stocks (55 percent) touted by Kiplinger's
lost to comparable indexes. As for Worth, 28 out of 55 stocks, or
51 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   If you took the average return per article, excluding dividends,
and compared the result with a comparable index, 56 percent of
Money magazine's articles did not beat the market. SmartMoney had a
75 percent miss, half of Worth's articles did not beat the indexes
and none of Kiplinger's articles outpaced the market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's not easy to beat the market. Most mutual fund
managers don't do better than the S&AMP;P 500. Some of the stock picks
in the articles performed well over 12 months but still didn't
outpace the market.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's April 1997 issue recommended buying Chase Manhattan,
which rose 42 percent in a year. But that didn't beat the S&AMP;P 500's
45.88 percent gain over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't much better even if the yardstick is simple
profitability -- whether a stock increased after a year (or, in the
case of the January 1998 special issue, nine months).
</P>
<P>
   Using this yardstick, 18 of 39 individual stocks recommended by
Money from June to August 1997, or 46 percent, lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the performance of all recommendations by article,
three out of nine Money stories showed negative returns -- a 33
percent miss.
</P>
<P>
   However, Money made a good call in an August 1997 article,
``Don't Just Sit There ... Sell Stock Now.'' Investors who acted on
it would have avoided the October 1997 correction and the current
bear market -- providing they put the money in cash, money market
accounts or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If someone followed the magazine's advice and bought stocks
recommended in other articles in the same issue, the results
would've been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, $1,000 invested in each of five stocks recommended
in ``Defend your portfolio with stocks that promise income and
growth,'' would have made $1,345, or 28 percent, in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But if someone bought $1,000 worth of each stock recommended as
hedges against inflation that also was in the same issue, he would
have lost $1,247 a year later, or 26 percent. Indeed, four out of
the five picks were losers.
</P>
<P>
   As for SmartMoney, 16 out of 27 stocks recommended in the May,
July and October 1997 issues, or 59 percent, lost money. If each of
the four articles examined was tallied separately, half had
declines.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiplinger's April and August 1997 issues, four out of 20
stocks lost money -- a 20 percent miss. One out of four articles
(25 percent) lost money. As for Worth's June 1997, September 1997
and January 1998 issues, 35 out of 55 stocks lost ground (64
percent) and three out of four articles (75 percent) showed losses.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Gilbert, financial editor for SmartMoney in New York,
contends that one year is not enough time to determine a stock's
success. If an investor waits at least five years, ``75 to 80
percent'' of SmartMoney's stock picks will make money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's ``preaches long-term investing'' of at least three
to five years, said Manny Schiffres, senior associate editor in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many stories from his and other magazines remind readers about
the long-term nature of their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not always clear how long an investor has to wait
before the investment produces a competitive return, noted Lou
Richman, financial editor at Yonkers, N.Y.-based Consumer Reports
magazine, which publishes a mutual fund issue once a year.

RANGERS NIP ISLANDERS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game had five goals, all of them important, most
of them with style. But it was the one important shot that did not
cross the line that provided the best moment of a match that ended
in a 3-2 New York Rangers victory over the New York Islanders last
night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It came on a penalty shot by the Islanders' Claude Lapointe, who
had a chance to tie the score with 4 minutes 42 seconds remaining.
Kevin Stevens had just given the Rangers the lead with his first
goal in a season of personal rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   After Lapointe was pulled down by Brian Leetch on a breakaway,
Referee Dan Marouelli called for the shot. There was a brief delay,
and Richter said it allowed Lapointe to prepare himself physically
while allowing Richter to prepare himself mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pride in these situations,'' said Richter, who has
stopped 7 of 8 penalty shots in his regular-season career. And he
is 2 for 2 in the playoffs, including one against Vancouver's Pavel
Bure in the Stanley Cup finals of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe skated in quickly, faking several times, the puck
ending up on his backhand. Richter, who had gone out to meet
Lapointe, skated backward and matched him move for move. Lapointe
took a low, backhanded shot that Richter stopped with his left leg
pad to the cheers of the crowd as the goalie pumped his arm in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first time taking a penalty shot,'' said Lapointe, who
had 10 goals last season and has 67 in his nine-year career. ``When
you have a breakaway, the defense is chasing you and there is no
time to think. I guess I was thinking too much. I'm not a goal
scorer. I made a great move and he made a great save.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory continued a revival for the Rangers, who have won
two games in succession and are undefeated in three after starting
their season with four consecutive defeats. The game-winner was
significant for Stevens, who came to training camp with a sobering
new job description.
</P>
<P>
   Once a 50-goal scorer, Stevens was told by Coach John Muckler
that those days were over. Settle for a role as a checking left
wing, Muckler said. Not satisfied with Stevens's play, Muckler
benched him once in the first week. And the Rangers put him on
waivers, although no team took Stevens because of his $3 million
salary.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night Stevens gave a robust effort of skating,
checking and shooting. The score sheet credited him with six body
checks. He admitted that the change of role was difficult at the
age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird situation,'' Stevens said. ``I haven't played
once on the power play. Anyone who thinks you'll score 50 goals at
even strength, you're out of your mind. It's tough to score goals
these days. Obviously, I'd like to play on the power play and I'd
like to play more. Mentally, it's a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean, another 33-year-old veteran, scored one of the
Ranger goals and Mike Knuble got the other. Trevor Linden and
Robert Reichel scored for the Islanders. Tommy Salo, the Islander
goalie, stopped 27 shots and was one of the best participants in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Salo turned away a Leetch blast on the power play; he stopped
Wayne Gretzky up close with a pad save after a three-pass
combination had moved the puck low in the zone; he robbed Niklas
Sundstrom by sliding across the crease and snatching the puck with
his glove, and he beat Stevens on a break-in from the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky took a hard hit from Kevin Miller, leaving him on the
ice wincing. Gretzky played the rest of the game, but he left the
building limping. ``Hip pointer,'' he said. But Gretzky rarely
misses games and is expected to play on Friday afternoon in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders also survived an unusual penalty call: delay of
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' Coach Mike Milbury said. ``I have to
question his judgment. He said he gave us warnings. I've never seen
anything like that in my 25 years in the game. It was an absurd
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final seconds, after pulling Salo for an extra attacker,
the Islanders stormed Richter's crease. Lapointe got another
close-in shot, but Richter stopped it, leaving Lapointe to smack
the net with his stick in frustration.

DEVILS DEFEAT FLYERS, 3-2
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In the moments before the start of the third
period, New Jersey Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek stood alone at the
darkened bench. With his team still in the locker room, Ftorek
paced back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   He had already seen his team break out of the scoring drought
that plagued the Devils through the early going this season. Now,
he needed to find a way to hold the lead against the unbeaten
Philadelphia Flyers for the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay, back in the lineup for the first time this season
after sitting out the first four games with a groin strain, made it
easier for Ftorek to watch, scoring 29 seconds into the third
period to give the Devils a two-goal cushion. The goal provided
Martin Brodeur with what must have seemed like a flurry of goals
after seeing the Devils score only six goals in their first four
games, and he preserved the lead for a 3-2 victory at First Union
Center.
</P>
<P>
   For the Devils, despite their early season struggles and the
Flyers starting the season with a 4-0-1 mark, it was business as
usual. Last season, the Devils were 4-0-1 against the Flyers. So,
no matter that the goals came on a power play, while short-handed,
and with McKay sliding toward the net on his stomach, for the
Devils it was a hopeful sign that a return to form is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's early in the season, but that was the biggest game
of the year,'' McKay said. ``It's a good confidence builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur added: ``It's big. Just the fact that the Flyers hadn't
lost yet and we came in struggling, it woke us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lindros cut the lead to 3-2 with 6 minutes 49 seconds to
play, picking up a John LeClair pass in front and slipping the puck
between Brodeur's legs. Afterward, the Flyers did not want to hear
talk of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is last year,'' LeClair said. ``This is a new year.
We haven't struggled, but we haven't won as many as we should have
against them. They had our number a little bit. We'll find a way to
beat them later.''
</P>
<P>
   But now would have seemed the time. The Flyers entered the game
unbeaten with 14 goals scored and 5 allowed, while the Devils were
1-3 and had showed little inclination for putting the puck in the
net. And after a sloppy start, the Devils admitted afterward that
they were fortunate to be trailing by just 1-0 after the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were 1 of 10 on power plays entering the game, and
after squandering their first opportunity tonight, they struck
quickly on their second chance. When Lindros was sent off for
interference at 6:26 of the second period, it took only eight
seconds for the Devils to get on the board, tying the game at 1-1
when Jason Arnott blasted a shot from the top of the right circle
and Brendan Morrison, stationed in front of the net, deflected the
shot past John Vanbiesbrouck for his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils then added their first short-handed goal of the
season, also in the second period, when Scott Stevens cleaned up a
rebound of a Dave Babych shot, flicking it toward the Flyer goal.
Brian Rolston outraced the Flyers to the puck, picking it up just
past the red line, and as he swooped toward the goal with Babych in
pursuit, he flipped the puck in the air as he was falling down,
dropping it over the left shoulder of Vanbiesbrouck for a 2-1
Devils' lead.

FRANCIS SARGENT, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, DIES AT 83
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Francis W. Sargent, the moderate Republican, defender
of the environment and solver of fiscal crises who served as
governor of Massachusetts from 1969 to 1975, died on Thursday at
his home in Dover, Mass. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent moved up from lieutenant governor when Gov. John Volpe
was made transportation secretary in the Nixon administration and
was elected in 1970 over the mayor of Boston, Kevin White, to a
full term.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent was also known for his delicately middle-of-the-road
approach to Boston's busing strife and helped gain passage of a
no-fault car insurance law. He backed public housing, environmental
protections and a statute challenging the Vietnam War on legal
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent was born in Massachusetts, attended the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, (which led to a favorite motto of his:
``Don't ask me, I didn't go to Harvard.'') and went on to serve in
a variety of state and federal jobs involving fish, game, and other
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   He lost an election for the state Senate in 1962 but ran
successfully in 1966 for lieutenant governor. His campaign slogan
was ``Put Sarge in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, he set a record by signing 1,000 new laws in 1971,
and in 1972, he won a battle he called his own Vietnam: he helped
defeat a plan for an ``inner belt'' expressway in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But in his run for re-election during a sour economic period in
1974 he lost to his Democratic challenger, Michael Dukakis, and
stayed out of the central fray of politics from then on, though he
taught and wrote commentary in his later years.
</P>
<P>
   During the friction-filled busing period in Boston in the early
1970s, Sargent responded to the racial tension raised by the
integration plan to shuttle black and white children between
neighborhoods by proposing a ``freedom of choice'' scheme that
would have allowed white children to remain in their neighborhoods
while black children were bused to better schools.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent was married since 1938 to his wife, Jessie, with whom he
had three children, Jessie, Fay and Bill.
</P>
<P>
   He was decorated for his service as a paratrooper in World War
II. Upon his return from the war, he lived on Cape Cod, and, an
enthusiastic fisherman, became interested in environmental issues
when he saw the effects of overfishing there.
</P>
<P>
   A profile earlier this month in The Boston Globe described
Sargent as the last of a breed of homegrown Yankee governors that
included names like Saltonstall, Peabody and Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   In person, he has been described as salty and flinty in typical
Yankee fashion. His penchant for economizing came in handy when
Massachusetts hit a budgetary crisis brought on largely by high
welfare costs. In response, Sargent pushed legislation that altered
eligibility requirements for Medicaid and imposed a new tax on
special interests and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent suffered from heart trouble, and had recently been
sharply restricted in his activities, unable to drive or fish
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He had open-heart surgery in 1981. But in his interview with The
Globe, he sounded as feisty as ever, asking at one point, ``How'd I
get to be so old?''

ALL BASEBALL ROADS LEAD TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ By this morning, most of the Padre bits will have
been picked from the trees, lawns and cars in Mission Valley,
leaving the locals to ponder how it was that their little baseball
team was blown up.
</P>
<P>
   Championship-series sweeps are hard things with which to deal.
Losing is tough enough without getting pantsed on national TV in
the showcase moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres and their fans console themselves with a splendid
98-win regular season and triumphs over favored Houston and Atlanta
in the playoffs, as well as presumed momentum for a Nov. 3 ballot
measure that would build a new baseball-only park downtown.
</P>
<P>
   That look to the past is comforting, particularly in view of the
alternative _ the look ahead, where the champion New York Yankees
are so far distant they are quickly becoming dots on the horizon
even to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   A 125-50 seasonal record has a way of taking the air right out
of the room. It's how the NBA has been in the 1990s with the
Chicago Bulls. Granted, the Yankees have won just two recent titles
compared to the Bulls' six, but in view of October's developments,
the prospect of a parallel dynasty can now be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare teams from different eras, but the Yankees
are very, very good,'' said Padres batting coach Merv Rettenmund.
``They're nothing like the Braves. The Braves have some problems.
So does Houston. Both of those are fine teams, but they're not the
complete package the Yankees are.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete package is when the regular left fielder goes down
with colon cancer and is replaced by a rookie who hits .600 in the
World Series. A complete package is when the No. 4 starter pitches
seven shutout innings in the climax game, and the No. 5 starter
isn't needed to throw once in the postseason. A complete package is
when the closer has a career postseason ERA of 0.51, the best in
history, and he's not even the team's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the 125 victories came during an expansion year, but that
doesn't account for the gap between the Yankees and the rest of
baseball. Liberal free agency makes consistency hard to sustain,
yet the Yankees would appear to have a set-up about as
flop-resistant as can be created.
</P>
<P>
   Without a significant limit on what can be spent on players,
baseball championships mostly go to those who will pay anything to
win. No baseball follower needs to be reminded that's George
Steinbrenner's style, and has been since the Nixon presidency. Not
only did he top baseball this year with a player payroll of $74
million, $21 million more than the Mariners and $23 million more
than the Padres, he annually floods his organization with scouts,
coaches, instructors and consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the wealth of resources, the stewardship of manager Joe
Torre has nearly eliminated the Bronx Zoo fractiousness that, all
other things being equal, kept at least some free agents away.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of New York being a disgusting place to live, what's to
stop every top free agent from giving the Yankees first refusal?
For the money Steinbrenner pays, the player can hire a limo to take
him from his doorstep to a bigger limo.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, unlimited capital makes for leverage with other
teams. For example, the acquisition from Minnesota last winter of
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was accomplished not only with four
prospects but $2.5 million. That kind of package would have bought
the Mariners a season-rescuing closer such as Randy Myers or Rod
Beck, but it was chump change for the Yanks. The same kind of deal
was made with Oakland for Scott Brosius, the Series MVP.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is odious for the rest of the American League, which
has now won 10 of the last 15 Series. Although half the league has
won championships in that time (Minnesota and Toronto as well as
the Yanks have won twice), the gravitational pull toward New York
is immense. The Yankees are not infallible or invulnerable _ before
their 1996 championship, New York had not claimed a Series in 15
years _ but the economic forces in the game work strongly in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the increasingly fewer teams still owned by a
dedicated (albeit sometimes self-destructive) individual, whose
primary joy is limitless winning. It can be a big asset in the
increasingly corporate world of baseball, where media owners such
as the Disney Company (Angels) and the Chicago Tribune (Cubs)
aren't in baseball as much to win as to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a dollar brawl in the National League between the
Braves and Dodgers, whose arch-rival owners, Ted Turner and Rupert
Murdoch, undoubtedly will allow their mutual hatred to spill into
free-agent contracts, there are few if any owners who are
passionate/nuts enough to match the standards that Steinbrenner is
setting this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of baseball largely will be left to play Spot the Dot,
after picking up the October pieces.

   SEATTLE _ Addressing a delegation of Wisconsin farmers with an
unknown axe to grind in 1859, Abraham Lincoln invoked an ancient
phrase: ``This, too, shall pass away.''

   The Beavers come north tomorrow to Husky Stadium, burdened by an
NCAA-record streak of 27 consecutive losing seasons. Jack LaLanne
was young the last time OSU had a winning season. Richard Nixon and
Watergate hadn't been mentioned in the same sentence yet.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oregon State is 4-3, and in Corvallis, there has even been
talk of bowl games. Mike Riley, the second-year head coach, grew up
there, knows where the bones are buried (all over), and has OSU
fans genuinely excited about what's down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about those 27 years is, well, they're so damned
unanimous. In that time, Beaver fans have seen indigents like
Kansas State and Northwestern have winning seasons. UTEP has done
it. Vanderbilt, even. New Mexico and Rice. Wake Forest, Duke.
Everybody has chugged from the chalice of victory, except the
Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use those schools as a model,'' Riley said. ``I use Kansas
State as a great model for Oregon State. If they can do it, why not
us?''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, indeed? It's happened in Manhattan, Kan., and Evanston,
Ill. And here's proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers should realize this, however: There is the
occasional bump in the road. But they knew that already.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the Wildcats were the worst of the worst. They
had two winning seasons between 1954 and 1991. K-State finished the
'80s with a flourish: 1-36-1.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bill Snyder arrived, improved facilities and State got
good. Now it's like the Wildcats have won the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they have. Dave Wagner, a booster from Dodge City,
Kan., won $35 million in Lotto America and donated $800,000 to slap
new AstroTurf in the stadium. Voila, Wagner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has made Wildcat faithful forget the bad old days, like
the loss to Austin Peay in 1987. And the year back in the mid-'70s
when the coach, Ellis Rainsberger, signed 43 recruits to letters of
intent when the NCAA allowed only 30.
</P>
<P>
   It's mathematics like that that put Boston Market into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian
</P>
<P>
   TCU had 12 straight losing seasons from 1973-84. Then its
boosters discovered a popular means to victory: They paid a star
player, running back Kenneth Davis, and in 1984, went 8-4. That got
the Frogs on probation, and it was another 10 years before they
went to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   The lowlight of the 12-year TCU dry spell came in 1977, when an
Oregon defensive back named Kenny Bryant picked off a Frog pass
near the Duck goal line and had a clear path 97 yards to the end
zone. But a TCU reserve named Steve Barker leaped off the bench and
nailed Bryant near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted to make things happen,'' Barker
shrugged. ``I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas-El Paso
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stull, a former Washington assistant coach, achieved winning
years at UTEP in the late '80s. Before that, the Miners had 16
straight losing seasons from 1971-86. UTEP once drew only 2,300 for
a game against Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, there were fewer people than that in the stands as
wind-whipped sleet pelted West Texas. Eddie Mullens, then the
publicist at UTEP, had the P.A. announcer invite everybody up to
the press box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if they were that brave,'' Mullens says, ``they
ought to see the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullens has also seen the scrub-off-the-bench-illegally routine,
in a game against Hardin-Simmons. Unlike the Oregon-TCU incident,
no touchdown was awarded to the UTEP player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't outrun a fat woman,'' Mullens said. ``No way was
he gonna score, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it from a bowl drought that stretched from
1961 to 1989, but Duke has some football history. In fact, in the
only Rose Bowl game ever played away from Pasadena in 1942, Duke
hosted (and lost to) Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the Blue Devils cursed themselves in 1962,
when they turned down the Gator Bowl, believing they were the stuff
of bigger bowls. The moral for the Beavers: If you win six games,
take what's offered.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico
</P>
<P>
   The Lobos went to a bowl game last year, and then the coach,
Dennis Franchione, split for Texas Christian. Some would say that's
pressing your luck.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, New Mexico hadn't been to a bowl game since the
short-lived Aviation Bowl in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' says publicist Greg Remington of New Mexico,
``going to Dayton, Ohio, for a bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Darkness really descended on New Mexico in the late '80s, about
the time coach Mike Sheppard was going 9-50. The Lobos would
occasionally request that fans bring to games a toy or stuffed
animal for needy children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would drop the stuff off,'' Remington says, ``and
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like to discourage players from celebrating in the end
zone by telling them to act like they've been there before. That
seems to apply to fans in Las Cruces, where State has had only two
winning seasons since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the Aggies beat UTEP, and fans tore down the
goal posts. The next week, they beat New Mexico, and they tore down
the goal posts again. There is great fear of the day the Aggies get
their first bowl bid since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores actually are tied with Washington as one of four
teams with 21-year streaks of winning seasons. But that happened
from 1915-35.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much everything you need to know about current-day Vandy
football occurred Oct. 3 at TCU. There, the Commodores won the coin
toss for overtime and blocked TCU's field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   On its very first offensive play, Vandy elected to try a 42-yard
field goal. There is field position, and then there is the fetal
position.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, that kick was blocked, too, and Vanderbilt lost in
the next overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern
</P>
<P>
   If you can win at Northwestern, then anything is possible,
except Rick Venturi coaching again. He was 1-31-1 from 1978-80.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what possessed Gary Barnett to leave an assistant's
job at Colorado, against all advice, to become head coach in 1992.
The year before, Northwestern had actually ``sold'' a home game to
Cleveland, and the Wildcats played Ohio State at Municipal Stadium,
the mistake by the lake.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``High Hopes,'' Barnett relates the story of how
athletic director Bruce Corrie was showing him Northwestern's
facilities as part of his interview.
</P>
<P>
   They were in the press box at Dyche Stadium on a chilly December
day and pushed the elevator button, only to find the power had been
turned off. The door to the stairwell was locked. So there he was,
Northwestern's future savior, crawling through a window to return
to ground level.
</P>
<P>
   Rice
</P>
<P>
   The Owls went 30 years (1962-91) without a winning season (they
did go .500 twice). Apropos of Rice, when it won a co-championship
in the Southwest Conference with four other teams in 1994, it had a
losing record (5-6).
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Jerry Berndt. He came from Penn to take over
Rice in the late '80s and soon mounted an 18-game losing streak.
Curiously, somebody at Temple remembered Berndt well enough to
offer him the head coaching job there.
</P>
<P>
   That put Berndt in the novel position of being 0-18 and going in
to ask his boss at Rice if he wanted to counter Temple's offer. To
which he was told something like, ``Don't let the door hit you in
the backside on your way out to Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Berndt was toast at Temple, too. Unlike him, Mike Riley
has no other offer, only Abe Lincoln's certainty that this, too,
shall pass.

CANIZALES CRUISES; HIGHSMITH SHOCKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Orlando Canizales, the evening went as
expected. Alonzo Highsmith, the former NFL running back, wishes he
could say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Canizales, the former bantamweight champion, stopped journeyman
Tomas Valdez in the third round of a scheduled 10-round
featherweight bout on Thursday at the Country Club in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated Highsmith was knocked out in the third round by
unknown 33-year-old Terry Vernes of Fresno in spite of a 24-pound
weight advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Vernes didn't have an easy time.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt badly in both the first and second rounds and bleeding from
his nose, the 210-pounder came from nowhere in the third. He
staggered Highsmith early, knocked him down once, then rocked him
with lefts and rights to finish him off at 1:19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought in here to lose,'' Vernes said, ``but now it's a
big upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith, a former running back for the Houston Oilers and
Dallas Cowboys who came in 27-0 with 23 knockouts, remained on the
canvas for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Vernes said he was not intimidated by Highsmith's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just made me fight harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernes was on the verge of being knocked out in both early
rounds but shakily surged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go down because I have strong legs,'' said Vernes, in
the midst of a comeback after an eight-year layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Canizales, of Laredo, Texas, used short, accurate punches to
knock down Valdez four times, twice in the fourth, to put him away.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, light heavyweight Victor Ortiz of Simi Valley
knocked out John Parker of San Diego at 58 seconds of the second
round. Eddie Gutierrez of Palmdale rose from the canvas to knock
out Tommy Hindes of Los Angeles in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Quiles, 142, knocked out Margarito Navarro, 139, in the
third. And Pamela Barker decisioned Paula Faye in a four-round
women's match.

EVEN WINNING ISN'T PRETTY FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Over the past 11 days, the Arizona State Sun
Devils told us that hope still floated, that there was still reason
to believe this football season could be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   They would be rested and renewed from the long layoff after the
embarrassing 28-9 loss to Notre Dame. With a new quarterback and a
fresh attitude, they could transform themselves from being one the
biggest busts in the country to a bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the grand delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hope for a decent season, which started circling the drain way
back in September, is not completely gone. But an overtime victory
over Stanford, which is now tied for last in the Pac-10, doesn't
seem much of a rallying point.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Thursday night, the Sun Devils looked like they had
spent the last 11 days working on ways to blow a game. Quarterback
Chad Elliott did a dead-on imitation of the way the guy he
replaced, sophomore Ryan Kealy, had been playing. Elliott overthrew
some passes, forced others into coverage and occasionally hit
someone in the numbers, including one Stanford defender.
</P>
<P>
   The best plays he made all night were the times he handed off to
tailback J.R. Redmond, who scored three touchdowns in the first
half before an ankle injury ended his evening.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third quarter, Elliott was standing on the
bench, watching Kealy resurrecting his career by bringing the Sun
Devils back from a 31-24 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The defense committed dumb penalties all night. The coaching
staff made questionable decisions. And the Sun Devils, until
Kealy's heroics, were nearly helpless to pull themselves out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has said that it's evident that nothing will come easily
for the Sun Devils this season. Balls bounce the wrong way. Tipped
passes fall into the wrong hands. You have to go into overtime to
beat Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But to blame this season on bad luck, rotten karma or faulty
chemistry is to ignore the obvious: The Sun Devils aren't talented
enough.
</P>
<P>
   You don't drop out of the top 10 and into oblivion faster than
Supertramp because the ball just doesn't bounce your way. Other
than Redmond, name one Sun Devil offensive player who scares
anyone. Name one defender that keeps opposing offensive
coordinators in the office after dark.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that this team quit after losing to Washington in the
opener, as some have suggested. It's that it wasn't very good in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck doesn't explain this season's blunders, or even those
made Thursday night. Near the end of the first half, the Sun Devils
forced Stanford into a third-and-10 situation. It was the perfect
time to take a timeout in an effort to get the ball back with
enough time to try to score.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sun Devils, ahead 21-14, did nothing. Stanford
punted, and after a penalty, ASU took over with 10 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   And bad luck doesn't explain the first play of the second half,
when Stanford receiver DeRonnie Pitts was left alone to run down
the center of the field and catch a 78-yard touchdown pass to tie
the score.
</P>
<P>
   The struggles in the first two months of the season seem to have
brought about a change in philosophy in Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, before the Notre Dame game, Snyder spoke of
winning the last six games of the season. Even after that loss,
Snyder was still talking of the possibilities of a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he allowed himself to imagine his team
winning five straight, beating Arizona in Tucson, going to a bowl
game.
</P>
<P>
   This coming from a man who has made ``One at a time'' his
mantra. When he came to ASU from California, he had the slogan
printed on nearly everything, like a mother sewing her kid's name
into everything before he leaves for camp.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of anything but the present used to be blasphemous
around the Sun Devils' program. Players were taught to shield their
eyes from the horizon and to look down to see where their next
steps were going to land.
</P>
<P>
   This team needed something to salvage. So Snyder, who could
become a psychiatrist if he wanted to take a pay cut, started
looking long term. One at a time gave way to talk of winning
streaks and bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a stretch,'' Snyder said earlier this week as he
spoke of the possibilities of keeping hope alive. ``But that's
where I am.'' &QL;

KEALY TO THE RESCUE  
 FINDS MCDONALD AS ASU WINS IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - In the face of adversity, you can always go home,
which is exactly what Ryan Kealy did in overtime Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State quarterback, an unlikely hero, connected with
old friend and former St. Mary's High School teammate Tariq
McDonald for a 25-yard scoring play to rally ASU to a 44-38 victory
over Stanford in front of 58,155 at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10) kept postseason hopes alive.
The Cardinal (1-6, 0-4) is eliminated from bowl contention.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy replaced starter Chad Elliott with 30 seconds remaining in
the third quarter and engineered two touchdown drives. He was 8 for
15 for 153 yards and two touchdowns and probably won his starting
job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``I have so many
things on my mind right now. He had his rhythm and reminded me of
the old Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild ride. Who would have imagined a second half that
featured Kealy in and star tailback J.R. Redmond out because of an
ankle injury?
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils won it with a 25-yard scoring pass from Kealy to
McDonald. Stanford missed a 42-yard field goal on the previous
play. College overtime consists of two series with each team
putting the ball in play from the opponent's 25-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was 8 of 17 for 92 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ASU tied the score at 38, on a 10-yard run by Davaren Hightower
with 2:05 remaining in the fourth quarter. Kenny Mitchell fueled
the drive with receptions of 33 and 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils dominated early, taking a 21-7 lead, before
Stanford responded with 17 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   The final quarter was a wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   ASU tied the score at 31 with 10:21 remaining when Kealy found
tight end Matt Cercone in the end zone for 2 yards. The quarterback
was 4 of 5 for 47 yards during the drive. It was the Sun Devils'
first touchdown pass in nine quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford went ahead, 38-31, on a 28-yard pass from Joe Borchard
to Troy Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sun Devils had their moments, there still was
plenty of the old ASU on the field. The qualities that have set
back this team _ giving up big plays and special teams mistakes _
resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils had their second punt of the season blocked in
the first quarter when Stanford's Tim Smith broke through ASU's
coverage untouched and got a hand on Stephen Baker's kick. Anthony
Gabriel recovered at the Sun Devils' 12 and the Cardinal scored
three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, ASU cornerback J'Juan Cherry mishandled a
punt and Stanford recovered. It converted the mistake into a
34-yard field goal and gave the Cardinal its first lead.
</P>
<P>
   And big plays? How about the 78-yard pass from Stanford
quarterback Todd Husak to DeRonnie Pitts that tied the game at 21?
The closest ASU defensive back appeared to be running in from
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd made it clear it is losing patience with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Boos came rather frequently, starting at the end of the first
half when fans felt the Sun Devils should have called a timeout
during Stanford's final drive so the ASU offense could put together
one last surge. When the Sun Devils did get the ball back, the
timeout came with two seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The team also was booed as it accumulated penalties, and then
the fans let the officials have it a few times for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was ``The Redmond Show''.
</P>
<P>
   He put ASU ahead, 7-0, on a 58-yard run with 10:31 remaining in
the quarter behind solid blocking and fancy footwork. It was the
fifth run of his career of more than 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes later the score was 14-0 thanks to
Redmond, who returned a punt 76 yards for the score. It was his
first return for a touchdown in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal scored on its next possession, and it was helped by
a 41-yard return by Juan-Carlos Lacey. The drive was capped by Joe
Borchard's 19-yard scoring pass to Tafiti Uso. &QL;

STARS OUTSHINE COYOTES  
 PHOENIX COACH ANGRY OVER LATE PENALTY CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Coyotes were in a loose mood before Thursday
night's game against the Dallas Stars. At the morning skate, some
of them were kicking around a soccer ball in the hallways of
Reunion Arena. A couple of hours before the opening faceoff, a
bunch of them took turns tossing a football back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't forget about another sport _ hockey. Well, not
until the final period, when the referees might have forgotten,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Once the puck dropped, the Coyotes were all business, but they
managed to let things slip through their fingers during the final
20 minutes and wound up losing to the Stars, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk, playing his first game for Dallas since
undergoing reconstructive surgery on both knees in April, set up
the Stars' first goal and scored what proved to be the game-winner
at 4:52 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour stopped 20 shots to help the Stars remain unbeaten
after four games on home ice, where they have outscored the
opposition, 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is Phoenix's modest two-game win streak, and with it, so is
a ton of momentum they hoped would get them off to a good start in
the first game of five straight away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored the go-ahead goal on the power play when his
shovel pass through the slot clipped the stick of Coyotes
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky and deflected past Nikolai Khabibulin
(30 saves).
</P>
<P>
   It came during the first of four penalties in the third period
by the Coyotes, who were playing without injured forward Dallas
Drake, and Schoenfeld was livid about it. But his anger was mostly
directed at Mike Leggo and Mick McGeough, the second straight
two-referee pairing Phoenix has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about the (expletive) referees, not our penalties,''
Schoenfeld shouted afterward, kicking over a chair in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good in the first period and tried to sit on it
early in the second, and then we came on. . . . But the calls. The
non-calls. It's the equity of the calls, I guess, is what I'm
saying. If an infraction is let go the other way, then why is that
call made?''
</P>
<P>
   First, it was Jeremy Roenick who was hit with a tripping call
behind the Coyotes' net. Then it was a roughing minor on Keith
Tkachuk. Next, a slash by Keith Carney. And finally, interference
on former Dallas player Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That interference on `Gus' was (expletive) laughable,''
Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld's game plan was for the Coyotes to initiate the
aggression early and hope Dallas would retaliate. That's a tactic
the Stars have worked to perfection in past games with Phoenix, and
one that led to 11 power play opportunities Tuesday night during a
3-1 victory over Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy when we play this team to get emotionally charged,''
Schoenfeld said. ``But we usually end up playing short for the
first eight minutes of the first period, and they end up scoring on
a couple of power plays to get the jump on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher were hit with the only
two penalties in the opening 20 minutes, and the Coyotes turned the
first one into a 1-0 lead at the 4:09 mark when Oleg Tverdovsky
unleashed a 40-foot slap shot that Belfour apparently never saw.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Nieuwendyk's return, the Stars were gunning early
but couldn't get anything past Khabibulin. A would-be goal in the
second period by Mike Keane was waived off when video replays
showed he was in the crease before redirecting the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk helped tie the score at 1 about five minutes later,
setting up Sergei Zubov on the power play. The Stars' had scored 16
goals this season up to that point, and Zubov was on the ice for 14
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Nieuwendyk back should pay huge dividends in a hurry. He
led Dallas last season with 39 goals and set a franchise record
with 11 game-winners, second-best in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a complete player who does a lot of things,'' said Stars
forward Brett Hull, whose five-game scoring streak came to an end.
``I don't think he's lost a step, even with the knee injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hull, Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor also was kept
off the score sheet. Sydor entered the game leading the league in
scoring with 10 points on four goals and six assists. &QL;

B.  LABONTE ON VERGE OF BREAKOUT SEASON  
 IT COULD COME AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - Jeff Gordon bashing is everywhere. Even in
restaurants where Bobby Labonte sometimes eats his supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I see at restaurants and places I go to here in High
Point (N.C.), they say, `Hey, man, I wish someone else would win.
Jeff's winning all these races, da, da, da,' '' Labonte said. ``One
thing about that is I wish I was in (Gordon's) shoes. I wish I was
winning all these races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they (fans) wouldn't like me, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But what's not to like about the personable Labonte?
</P>
<P>
   More than that, what's not to like about Labonte's abilities
behind a NASCAR Winston Cup steering wheel?
</P>
<P>
   Although he's yet to become a prolific winner on the stock-car
circuit, unlike you-know-who, Labonte has proven to be a constant
threat week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 starts, Labonte already has accumulated career highs in
top-five finishes (11) and top-10s (18). And beginning with the
Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway,
there still are three remaining races.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not enough time to flag down series leader Gordon,
runner-up Mark Martin or third-place Dale Jarrett, Labonte is in a
position to overtake Rusty Wallace for fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   One or two more sputtering finishes, however, and Labonte could
drop to seventh place, which is where he finished a year ago
driving the Joe Gibbs-owned Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand
Prix.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Wallace is fifth, which if he remains there,
wouldn't terribly upset Gibbs at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finishing fifth in this league is great,'' said Gibbs, a Super
Bowl-winning coach for the Washington Redskins. ``This NASCAR deal
is tough. It's competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mystified by what Gordon's team has done (11 wins, 24
top-five finishes) because it's hard to imagine somebody getting on
a roll like that. I mean, every week he's right there. They've got
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't spend our time thinking about what that team has.
We're trying to build on our own team. Our motivation is to achieve
those same results.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Team Gibbs appears to have unlocked some of the secrets
to producing strong runs on the circuit's flat tracks such as PIR,
such results could be right around the next corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a pretty good basis to go off of now,'' said
Labonte, who has two wins this season and seven in his career, all
since joining Gibbs in 1995. ``I'm sure we'll never say it's
perfect, but we know it's better than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, watch out for Labonte in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a few bad breaks, Gibbs said, this season might have
been the year Labonte challenged for the crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 20 races have been the best we've ever had,'' Gibbs
said. ``We've only had one bad race. The rest of them were
unfortunate wrecks. If they hadn't of happened, we'd be in the
thick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season would be soon enough for Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be hard this season,'' said Labonte,
whose older brother Terry is a two-time Winston Cup driving
champion. ``And I can count four races right now that I wish I
could have back. You just can't have four bad races. You can't have
any bad races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I think we had a good shot this year. Circumstances
just didn't go our way. But we should have an even better shot next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough of a shot to make Labonte a preseason favorite to unseat
Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' said Labonte, who will be joined next
season by teammate Tony Stewart. ``I'd say we're definitely going
to be (a contender). If we do everything right, we will be. If we
don't, we won't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a great fleet of cars and a great crew chief
in Jimmy Makar. We have all the ingredients. The morale is great
and we have a great team. We're all one big happy family.''
</P>
<P>
   A family that will be smiling even more should Labonte manage to
get a head start on next season by winning his first flat-track
race Sunday at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Phoenix because you don't have to run on the bottom all
day,'' Labonte said. ``You can run bottom, middle or high. And
there's different avenues where you can pass. It's just a great
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In three days, Labonte will discover just how great. &QL;

SPRAGUE NABS POLE FOR TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a good news, bad news Thursday for  &UR; Jack Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, clinging to a narrow 28-point lead over runner-up Ron
Hornaday in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series standings, will start
on the outside of the front row in Saturday's GM Goodwrench Service
Plus/AC Delco 300.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague did so by uncorking a 126.720 mph qualifying lap,
slightly less than pole-sitter  &UR; Mike Bliss (127.155 mph).
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news?
</P>
<P>
   No more twice-yearly Truck Series appearances at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   By adding a NASCAR Busch Series race to next year's NASCAR
Winston Cup weekend schedule, something had to go.
</P>
<P>
   That something was the truck event, whose only scheduled
appearance next year at PIR is in March during the Indy Racing
League event.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Sprague, who has won three of the past five races
and finished second and third in the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hate it,'' Sprague said. ``Phoenix is my favorite
racetrack. I'd race here every week if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bliss never has won a truck race at PIR, he always runs
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't finish well,'' said Bliss, who has won three U.S.
Auto Club Silver Crown race and one sprint car race at PIR.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stacy Compton narrowly missed out on the front row, qualifying
third at a speed of 126.711 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see going into (Turn 1),'' Compton said. ``The sun
was too far down.''
</P>
<P>
   Truck qualifying was delayed because of intermittent sprinkles,
forcing it to be held in the late afternoon, when a lowering sun
blinded most drivers as they entered Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell how deep to go in (the corner),'' Bliss said.
``They (his crew) said I drove too hard into it, but I thought I
lifted too early.''
</P>
<P>
   As for next year's inaugural Busch Series race, retired driver
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Allison believes it will be a hit with Valley race fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to see the up and coming stars,'' Allison said.
``And that
 &UR; Dale Earnhardt Jr. is a good one. I'm really impressed by him. I
like the way he applies himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of that racetrack savvy that his Dad
(seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion  &UR; Dale Earnhardt) has. He's
got the ability to get that last little bit out of a car.'' &QL; 
Pole cat II
</P>
<P>
   A part-time racer put a full-time effort into NASCAR Featherlite
Southwest Tour qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michael Alsup grabbed the pole with a speed of 129.767 mph, the
second time in two years he has captured the top qualifying spot.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for someone driving limited budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only our (seventh) race (of 14) this season,'' Alsup
said. ``It's my own car and we just haven't been able to get enough
funding to do the whole year. It's sort of a hit and miss thing for
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am thankful for the sponsors we do have. It's why we're
here at Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Alsup, 35, twice has finished third this season and is hoping
another good finish might open some eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my opportunities are getting slimmer as I grow older,''
Alsup said. ``I'd like to get into a (NASCAR Truck) deal or Winston
West.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Darrell LaMoure (127.886 mph) of Glendale starts in the fifth
row. &QL; 
Oops, it's Taurus
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's NASCAR Extra section in ``The Arizona Republic,''
last season's Ford Thunderbird was not updated to the Ford Taurus
in the drivers' bios. &QL; Pit stop
</P>
<P>
   Despite sprinkles, most of the schedule was completed. The only
scratch was a scheduled half-hour Southwest Tour practice. &QL;

RANKINGS SHOULD MOTI VATE UA

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, ARIZ. - A no-name, non-conference opponent at midseason
is often a loaded negative on the motivational scale, but Arizona
has reason not to go into snooze control Saturday night against
Northeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bowl Championship Series poll is due Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the BCS poll will only determine teams for the
national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl. But a spot among the
top 12 also will serve as an argument for a team seeking a place in
one of the other biggies _ the Rose, Orange and Sugar bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The once-beaten Wildcats are No. 13 in the Sagarin ratings, No.
14 in the Associated Press and ``Seattle Times'' polls, No. 16 in
ESPN/USA ``Today'' and No. 18 in the`` New York Times.'' An average
of all will determine the BCS ranking.
</P>
<P>
   With a loss to a team or two above them, the Wildcats could be
close to cracking the top 12.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA stays on track to the Fiesta, Arizona has hopes of going
to the Rose for the first time. But unprecedented factors could
intervene. If UCLA _ the probable Pac-10 champion _ goes to the
Fiesta, the Rose is under no obligation to take a Pac-10 team.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Arizona were to win the rest of its conference games,
the Rose still might fall for the powerful influence of Notre Dame
and Nebraska or opt for an unbeaten Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a team we feel is worthy, we're certainly going to
lobby the Rose Bowl,'' Pac-10 assistant commissioner &UR; Jim Muldoon
said. ``I suspect the Rose will take a look at its historic
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's safe to say that it won't take much of a look at any
team with a suspect performance against an obscure Northeast
Louisiana. &QL; 
Return trip &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Louisiana Coach  &UR; Ed  &UR; Zaunbrecher was Arizona's
offensive-line coach in 1975 and 1976. He also earned a master's
degree in guidance and counseling at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Zaunbrecher says the Wildcats compare favorably to two top
10-ranked teams, Florida and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is big and physical, and faster and quicker than
Florida and Kansas State,'' said Zaunbrecher, whose club has been
routed by both this season. &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona linebacker &UR; Marcus Bell, the conference's leading
tackler, has 78 tackles in seven games. He had a total of 80 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach &UR; Dick Tomey got some exercise this week in a couple
of pickup games at McKale Center with &UR; Adia Barnes, a former
Wildcats star now with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs. Tomey went
0-2. &QL;

ACT II, SCENE II: QB PLOT THICKENS  
 KEALY REPLACING ELLIOTT WASN'T IN SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - This wasn't in the script.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Elliott had a major but supporting role in his first start
at quarterback for Arizona State. Ryan Kealy, whom Elliott
replaced, was way down in the credits.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot turned Thursday night against Stanford when ASU
fell behind, 31-24, at the end of the third quarter. That's when
the Sun Devils turned to Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year sophomore redeemed himself by piloting two long
fourth-quarter touchdown drives, then connecting with his former
St. Mary's High School teammate Tariq McDonald on a 25-yard
touchdown pass on the Sun Devils' first play of overtime as ASU
won, 44-38.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy completed 8 of 15 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns
in a little more than a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, a redshirt freshman, basically was to hand off to J.R.
Redmond and watch along with everyone else as Redmond ran wild. But
by halftime, Redmond was gone, injured. The offense stopped. And
the defense couldn't stop Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   In came Kealy, who, it was surmised, lacked the confidence to
help produce a victory. Now he was in a pressure situation to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott seemed to have an easy part to play, especially with
Stanford sharing the billing at Sun Devil Stadium. Statistically,
the Cardinal has the worst defense in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott threw a harmless interception in the first series, and
then the story ran predictably. Redmond ran for 58 yards and a
touchdown. Redmond ran back a punt 76 yards for another touchdown.
Stanford scored, but Elliott began to limber his strong right arm.
A pair of co-stars made him look good. Lenzie Jackson made a great
catch, McDonald made a better one and then it was Redmond again,
from 3 yards out, for a 21-7 ASU lead.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the story line changed: Redmond hurt his ankle,
returned for a couple of plays, then went to the bench. Stanford,
meanwhile, scored twice. And then, with the ASU defense resembling
Stanford's, the Cardinal led, 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott completed 5 of his first 6 passes but was 3 for 11 after
that. Coach Bruce Snyder went to his bullpen. With 30 seconds left
in the third quarter, Kealy came in and led ASU on a 12-play,
80-yard drive to tie the game. He was 4 for 5 for 47 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The offense had done its job, but not the defense. Again.
Stanford cruised to a score and took a 38-31 lead with 8:16 to go.
That was the score when Kealy and ASU took over on their 20 with
3:32 left. Two passes, 32 and 33 yards, to Kenny Mitchell, and it
was first down on the Stanford 15. Three plays later, the score was
tied.
</P>
<P>
   ASU held, and with 39 seconds left, the Sun Devils had a first
down on the Stanford 37. Kealy located Davaren Hightower with a
swing pass and the reserve tailback motored 16 yards to the 21. On
4th and 13, Stephen Baker missed a 41-yard field goal with five
seconds left. But Kealy would get another chance. &QL;

BROKEN ANKLE TO SIDELINE DRAKE AT LEAST 1 MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Coyotes will be without first-line right wing
Dallas Drake for four to six weeks after tests revealed Thursday
that he suffered a fractured left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was finishing up the final drill of Wednesday's workout
when his skate caught a rut in the ice. He slipped and rookie
defenseman Bryan Helmer fell on top of him. Drake will not need
surgery and, for the time being, will not have his foot put in a
cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those stupid, freak things,'' center Jeremy
Roenick said. ``A lot of guys are (ticked) off right now. Stuff
like this doesn't need to happen in practice. It's one thing if you
do it in a game, but for Dallas to get hurt in the final seconds of
practice, it just sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake, who was paired with Roenick and Keith Tkachuk on the No.
1 line, is one of the Coyotes' grittiest players and hardest
workers. He scored 11 goals and 40 points in 60 games last season,
but his biggest contributions _ big hits in the open ice, the
grinding in the corners _ rarely show up in the score sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing him is going to be bigger than anyone thinks,'' Tkachuk
said. ``A lot of people don't know how much a guy like that brings
to the team. He works so hard and brings so much to the table. You
almost wish you had 20 Dally Drakes running around.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake, traded by the Detroit Red Wings in 1984, was working on
his rehabilitation just minutes after learning the extent of his
injury. During the morning skate at Reunion Arena, he wheeled a
stationary bike into the visitors' dressing room and rode it for
nearly 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four to six weeks is the maximum, but I'm hoping to get back
sooner than that,'' he said. ``You never know. It depends how the
rehab goes, but I'm walking around pretty good right now. It's just
frustrating. Things seemed to be going really well. Keith, JR and
me were starting to jell together, and I was real excited to have a
chance to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To fill Drake's spot on the roster, the team recalled
second-year forward Brad Isbister from Las Vegas of the
International Hockey League. Isbister, who played one game for the
Thunder, arrived in time for the morning skate and played mostly on
the fourth line during the game against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to step in and do whatever I can to help
contribute,'' said Isbister, who was a healthy scratch in Phoenix's
first two games. ``This is a chance to show myself and try to keep
myself in the lineup. Obviously, I'm not happy that it took Dallas
Drake to get hurt for me to be back here, but hopefully, I'll make
the most of it and try to give the team a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld's orders to Isbister, 21, were simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has to bring some passion to the game. He's a young
guy, and young guys should fill the room and the bench with
enthusiasm and play with that extra jump,'' Schoenfeld said. ``We
need him to be aggressive, and when he gets his scoring
opportunities, we need him to bury them.'' &QL;

A BITTER PILL: STAND PAT ON SLUMPING PLAY ERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's nothing worse than a good player gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Oakland wide receiver  &UR; Tim Brown. Last year, he
led the AFC in receiving with 1,408 yards. Through six games this
year, he's amassed a whopping 317 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of behavior I'd expect from a high school
letterman.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't make Brown a bad person. Let's face it, the Raiders
have a real quarterback problem _ they don't have a real
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reasons, Brown's collapse makes for some tough
decisions for fantasy owners. How long do you stick with a star in
a slump?
</P>
<P>
   There's always some lesser-known player on your roster who just
might be the answer that week. But you know the minute you start
the other guy, Brown will ring up 472 yards, score six touchdowns
and cement lasting peace in the Middle East _ all in one game.
</P>
<P>
   There's just nothing worse than benching your money player when
he has a big game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the classic case was Dallas running back  &UR; Emmitt
Smith, who always looked as if he were about to turn the corner.
Trouble is, before he got to the corner, he fell off the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Emmitt is productive enough to start every week, but
other players are causing owners' hair to fall out in clumps.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as with every other problem in the NFL, this is the
fault of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kordell Stewart has been a &QL; 
mega-bust, throwing for only 847 yards and three touchdowns in six
games. He's also rushed for 185 yards and one score _ little solace
to owners who took him fourth in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only quarterback in the AFC worse than Stewart is
San Diego's
 &UR; Ryan Leaf, who actually had a pass batted down by harsh language.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Stewart's receivers can be covered by motivated
sheep. Despite tossing a 55-yard bomb to  &UR; Charles Johnson last
week, Stewart often has nowhere to throw. At this point, it might
be impossible for him to pull out of his nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't change the laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart's not the only guy causing headaches. New York Jets
running back
 &UR; Curtis Martin has only one touchdown, mostly because coach  &UR; Bill
Parcells doesn't think he's big enough to move the pile around the
goal line. To prove his point, Parcells gave the ball to Martin
Monday night, and he was summarily poleaxed at the one-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle,  &UR; Ricky Watters has only 490 yards and one touchdown,
not quite the production of say, Chargers running back  &UR; Natrone
Means, who has 708 yards and four touchdowns for an otherwise
dismal team.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the strange case of  &UR; Herman Moore, who leads
the NFC in catches with 39, but only has 390 yards and one
touchdown.  &UR; Johnnie Morton occasionally has looked better, but his
space-cadet nature makes it easy for him to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? You're not going to like the answer. At this
point, I'd keep running these guys out there, unless your backup is
a proven commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, I can give you a really good deal on Tim Brown. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   I'd bench Jaguars quarterback  &UR; Mark Brunell against the Broncos
this week. Jacksonville has a trio of dinged-up running backs, and
the Broncos are monsters at home. I'd also stay away from any New
Orleans players against the Buccaneers. &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   Take a hard look at running back  &UR; John Avery, who keeps taking
away  &UR; Karim
 &UR; Abdul-Jabbar's &UR; playing time in Miami. This would be the perfect
time to deal Emmitt Smith, before he gets another nagging injury.
In Kansas City,  &UR; Donnell
 &UR; Bennett is suffering from a case of fumble-itis. &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's Jets tight end  &UR; Kyle Brady, the refrigerator on
wheels who got loose for two touchdowns Monday night against New
England. This may be the last time you ever see his name in print. &QL;

LIONS HAVE A BATCH OF OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Rookie quarterbacks  &UR; Peyton Manning and  &UR; Ryan
Leaf received most of the preseason hype _ and money _ but
statistics make a good case that Detroit Lions second-round pick
 &UR; Charlie Batch has been more proficient than his first-round
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, from Eastern Michigan, has an 83.2 quarterback rating
with four touchdown passes and two interception since replacing
 &UR; Scott Mitchell three games ago. Manning has a 63.5 rating, nine
touchdowns and 14 interceptions, while Leaf has a 33.3 rating, one
touchdowns and 12 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin suspects, is
that Batch might be in a more desirable circumstance than Manning
and Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably has the greatest running back to ever play back
there and hands the ball off to him a lot,'' Tobin said. ``He's
getting a lot of predictable coverages because of it, so he doesn't
have to face a lot of complex coverages when he wants to throw, and
he's making good decisions when he does throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals'  &UR; Jake Plummer, little more than a rookie himself,
has a 63.3 rating with six touchdown and 11 interceptions. &QL; 
Job hunting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis was taken aback
by a question posed by one of the 400 women in attendance at the
team's ``NFL 101, Class of 1998'' on Wednesday night in the Kachina
Ballroom of the Buttes Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The question? What determines whether you go with a zone
coverage or a man coverage on third down?
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a job?'' a stunned McGinnis answered. &QL; 
Good timing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a team is doing well, bye weeks are rarely appreciated. In
the case of the 3-4 Cardinals, however, it is welcomed by Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically and emotionally, it's a good time to recharge our
batteries and take some time off to get rededicated,'' he said.
``We have nine regular season games left and a lot of football to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well last week (a 34-7 loss to the New York
Giants), and we'll have two weeks to chew on that. Plus, we have
some guys nicked up a little, and it gives them time to get healthy
during this week and the first part of next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the team, which usually goes over films from a Sunday
game on Monday, will practice next Monday before taking their usual
day off Tuesday before beginning practice Wednesday on the Detroit
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll practice against some of the plays Detroit uses on
Monday, but because they play on Sunday, we'll wait until we see
those films before putting in our game plan on Wednesday,'' Tobin
said. &QL; 
Silly subject &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive tackle  &UR; Eric Swann was listed in ``Sports
Illustrated'' magazine's ``Dirty Dozen,'' or the 12 players who
would least likely make their way onto the pages of Emily Post.
</P>
<P>
   While the other 11 subjects are accused of less than
sportsmanlike behavior, Swann's presence on the list is basically
for losing his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying to control his temper, Swann refused to respond
to his inclusion on the list, but McGinnis wasn't shy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is so silly. Why would you even talk about it?''
McGinnis said. ``I just don't understand it. That's
sensationalizing things that don't pertain to football.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle  &UR; Rashod Swinger missed part of practice
Thursday after his knee collided with someone else's during a
nine-on-seven drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right, it's just bruised a little bit,'' Swinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end  &UR; Johnny McWilliams, cornerback  &UR; Tommy Knight, running
back  &UR; Adrian Murrell and guard  &UR; Chris Dishman also missed practice.
McWilliams and Murrell are suffering from calf injuries suffered
before Sunday's game against the Giants. McWilliams played, but
Murrell didn't. Dishman has a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knight (hamstring/knee) practiced yesterday, but his knee got
sore, and we decided to hold him out and give him Friday, Saturday
and Sunday off and then see what it's like on Monday,'' Tobin said.
``We might even hold him out Monday and see if its 100 percent on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle  &UR; Mark Smith missed Thursday's practice to be
present for the birth of his first child, a boy, in Birmingham,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Simeon Rice and safety  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter returned to practice
after being absent Wednesday to attend funerals. &QL;

DIVER CAN'T BREATHE EASY  
 ASTHMA SUFFERER STARS IN ALMOST EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Ariz. - As long as an inhaler and a breathing machine
are around, Scott Hunter feels no limits.
</P>
<P>
   He pushes himself through the day. He rises early for band
practice at Glendale High School. He studies and tutors others. He
sings in choir. He dives and swims after school. He bags groceries
at night. And, in a rare moment of relaxation, he listens to big
band music.
</P>
<P>
   If he had his way, the senior would be performing in the
school's fall play, ``The Diary of Anne Frank''.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, he played the lead in ``The Pirates of Penzance''
and won the school's musical star award.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a time when enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry,'' said Karen Hunter, Scott's mom. ``It's like,
`Scotty, you can't be doing all this.' He's doing it all. I get
concerned being a mother. But he just feels, `I can sit around and
feel sorry for myself, or I can excel to the best of my ability.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hunter, 17, 5-foot-7, 142 pounds, was born with severe
asthma. His mother said his attacks hit him so hard that he was
hospitalized for days, hooked up to IVs, given oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be gasping,'' Karen said. ``He'd get to the point
where his stomach and chest would sink in because he wasn't moving
any air. It was very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he was told he'd eventually outgrow the problem and
get stronger. He is doing better now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports was encouraged. So were the fine arts. He learned to play
trumpet when he was 15. He taught himself to play the drums and put
together a ``garage'' band in which he is the lead vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   He said he loved soccer but became frustrated when an asthma
attack prevented him from joining his friends on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard as a little kid to understand, `Why did this
happen to me? Why am I having this breathing trouble?' '' Scott
said. ``But I've grown to understand things better and take life as
it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cold weather tends to trigger the attacks, he said. He takes his
medication in the morning and at night, keeps his inhaler on the
pool deck and prays he doesn't get an attack similar to the one
last year that kept him out of the 4A state diving championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad. It was a killer,'' he said. ``I was afraid to take
a breathing treatment because it makes you so dizzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hunter said her son has a breathing machine at home and at
school. Scott doesn't fret. He takes his inhaler everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma has driven Hunter to pursue everything and anything. He
said he taught himself to dive three years ago when he gave up
summer baseball because, he said, it was too hot.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught himself the various swimming strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, at the city of Glendale meet, he won the 50-meter
freestyle, backstroke and butterfly. He was also first in diving.
Along with diving, he said he'll swim the 50-yard free at next
week's regionals.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has yet to lose a diving contest this prep season. He's
lost only one 50 free race. He feels the diving title at the state
championships Nov. 6 and 7 at Arizona State University is in reach.
</P>
<P>
   His main passion is diving. Peers are amazed that he had no club
training before a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call one night from a parent of the one of the kids on
the team,'' Karen Hunter said. ``He said, `I am so impressed with
your son. My son is a freshman and he was saying what a great diver
your son is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The parent had asked Scott why he didn't pursue diving more.
Karen, who basically is raising her son by herself and cleans homes
for a living, said she couldn't afford to put Scott into a club.
</P>
<P>
   The parent got Scott a sponsor to dive for the Kachinas, a local
diving team under the tutelage of former Olympic diver Barb Nejman.
Scott trains at Arizona State twice weekly with the Kachinas. He
feels he's gained more in a month than he did in three years. But
he will need more sponsors to continue with the Kachinas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hunter doesn't think about the championship weekend
ahead. He dives into his school work, maintaining straight A's this
semester. He helps other students with their studies. He works part
time at a grocery store. He goes to band festivals on weekends. And
he is psyched for the winter school play, ``Cinderella''.
</P>
<P>
   His story is a little like that. Rising above the odds.
Overcoming obstacles. Coming out gold. &QL;

CALL FOR SAFE NEEDLES TUCKED INTO SPENDING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By REYNOLDS HOLDING  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress has called for a dramatic reduction in accidental
needle injuries, urging federal health-care and worker-safety
agencies to require safer needles and more accurate reporting at
the nation's medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Congress has publicly acknowledged a
nationwide health crisis in which hundreds of health care workers
contract HIV, hepatitis B and other lethal viruses every year after
being stuck by contaminated syringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has finally recognized that needle sticks have become
epidemic among our nation's health care workers,'' said Andrew
Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union,
which represents hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors.
``This is the first step in what must be a total nationwide ban on
dangerous and deadly needles.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal spending bill signed into law Wednesday urges the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration
and other federal agencies to ``make reduction of accidental needle
sticks a priority by . . . taking all necessary actions to address
this serious public health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The language in the bill was introduced by California Sen.
Barbara Boxer and endorsed by OSHA.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, The Chronicle published a series of articles
that described how needle sticks had infected tens of thousands of
nurses, doctors, lab technicians and public safety workers with HIV
and hepatitis viruses over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The stories reported that needles with safety features have
existed for nearly a decade but that few are being used because of
inadequate regulation and the higher cost of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the new spending measure, Congress urges OSHA to require that
hospitals and other medical facilities record all accidental needle
sticks in logs mandated by the agency. As few as 10 percent of
needle injuries are recorded now, according to studies, because the
severity of the injuries _ and the infections they transmit _ may
not be known for many months.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also calls on the CDC and the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health to collect the numerous studies that
have compared the performance of standard needles with that of
safety needles.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new law asks the CDC to include in its hospital
manual a recommendation for the use of needles and syringes with
devices that protect against needle injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the measures is mandatory, the language ``is
another step in the right direction to protect the health and
safety of medical workers and their families,'' said David
Sandretti, a spokesman for Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Worker-safety advocates said they were pleased by Congress'
action but disappointed that it did not go further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small step,'' said Dr. June Fisher, a San Francisco
occupational safety expert. ``I would have liked to have seen
appropriations for training of institutions and health care
workers. But we welcome congressional attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, California became the first state in the nation to
require the use of safety needles as protection against needle
sticks. Under the new law, the state Occupational Safety and Health
Standards Board must issue final safety needle regulations by
August 1 of next year. Health care employers must begin shifting to
the safer devices on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Congress' statements, John Duncan, director of the
state Department of Industrial Relations, said, ``There's obviously
recognition that this issue is important, and they are finally
paying attention to it nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you look at California, and we've already done the heavy
lifting on a number of these issues. I recommend that they
duplicate what we're doing because a lot of this isn't that
complicated.''

STRONG WARNING ON DANGER OF PESTICIDES TO RURAL CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Pesticides pose a profound risk to children living in or near
agricultural communities, and the state and federal governments
should enact tougher restrictions, a national environmental group
said Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report analyzing 170 university and government studies, the
Natural Resources Defense Council said there is substantive
evidence indicating that the country's estimated 320,000 children
under age 6 who live on farms are exposed to dangerously high
levels of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural industry representatives say the report is poorly
conceived and arrives at improper conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The report's author, Gina Solomon, a physician and a senior
scientist for the NRDC, said children from farm families as well as
those living at the margins of farming communities are threatened
from agricultural poisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bull's-eye,'' said Solomon. ``Farmworker kids are
right at ground zero. They come into contact with pesticides from
their parents' clothes or from the soil, air and water in their
home environments. But there's a ripple effect _ kids who live near
farming operations but whose families are not involved directly
with agriculture are still absorbing far more pesticides than city
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was released simultaneously with petitions submitted
by NRDC and several labor, environmental and health groups to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The petition to the state requests a phase-out of farm chemicals
known to cause cancer and reproductive problems, increased research
on children and pesticide exposure, and consideration of the
special hazards that farm children face when determining pesticide
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The petition to the federal EPA seeks tougher pesticide safety
margins for children, consideration of all possible routes of
contamination when figuring pesticide risk, and denying the
licensing of any pesticide unless a test exists to detect it in the
environment and living tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau
Federation, the state's largest agricultural interest group, took
issue with NRDC's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``California agriculture is a responsible industry, and many of
our 75,000 member families have children of their own,'' he said.
``Many of the claims made in the report are simply not true and
don't take into account the regulations already in place and the
protections already provided. The tolerances set (in California)
today are made with a hundredfold safety factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Krauter said his organization welcomes ``peer-reviewed
scientific studies that lead to a greater understanding about
pesticides, but I don't think this particular report was
peer-reviewed. We need regulations based on real science and actual
use data.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon acknowledged that no definitive links have been made
between pesticides and disease, but said that the health
implications of heavy exposure are nevertheless clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the nature of pesticide risks, and we know that the
exposures are there,'' she said. ``There are two ambitious studies
going on now examining pesticide exposure in farm families, but the
data may not be available for years. We need to reduce the risk for
these children now.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Kearns, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's pesticide program, said staffers are looking
forward to reading the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that farmworkers, their families and children are an
important group and need to be protected from pesticide
exposures,'' Kearns said, ``and we'll consider NRDC's
recommendations to ensure that protection.'' &LR;

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WARNS OF OVERFISHING WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BARNUM  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    The United States and other nations must take dramatic,
economically painful steps to head off a collapse in global fish
populations, a new report by the National Academy of Sciences
warns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Previous studies by federal fishery agencies have found that as
many as 80 percent of commercial fish species in the United States
_ and more than a third worldwide _ are fully exploited or
overfished.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on those findings, the National Academy of Sciences
report, released Thursday by a panel of biologists, economists and
fishing industry representatives, calls forcefully for reducing
fish catches and repairing marine ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of fisheries depends on radically changing our
attitudes, practices and policies about fishing,'' said Jane
Lubchenco, a marine ecologist at Oregon State University and a
member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long been concerned about dwindling fish
populations. Off the West Coast, salmon and some species of
rockfish are on the decline, and squid has become the latest
fishery to become a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within five years, we're going to see big changes (in fish
populations) on our coast,'' said Tom Powell, a University of
California at Berkeley biologist and another panel member. ``We're
going to be pretty sorry if we don't take action now.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences report, ``Sustaining Marine
Fisheries,'' focuses on a range of causes and possible solutions to
overfishing, some of them familiar, some untested:
</P>
<P>
   -- Overcapacity in the fishing industry is widespread, largely
because of policies that encourage unrestricted competition on the
open seas.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, for example, the Pacific Fishery Management Council
has estimated that the fishing fleet is 21/2 times the size
necessary to catch the available resources.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce overcapacity and keep fishing at sustainable levels,
the report argues for assigning fishing rights or quotas that
individuals or enterprises could trade back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   --Marine refuges _ areas of the coast or ocean where it is
illegal to fish or capture marine species _ are an effective but
undervalued tool for keeping stocks healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Marine refuges have been used successfully to restore fish
populations in the Florida Keys and the Philippines, yet less than
a quarter of 1 percent of the open ocean or coastal areas are
designated as marine refuges.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for many more refuges, but stopped short of
endorsing a proposal that 20 percent of the world's oceans be off
limits to fishing by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   --The capture of unwanted marine species, known as bycatch,
should be taken into account in setting fishing quotas and
designing management plans.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about a quarter of the 110 million tons of fish and
invertebrates that are harvested from the world's oceans are
unwanted species.

   Environmental groups praised the report. ``It stands out as a
powerful call for action,'' said Karen Garrison, a fisheries
specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She said the report's message does not seem to be getting
through to policymaking bodies, like the Pacific Fisheries
Management Council, which manages West Cost fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   While the council recently took steps to control overfishing, as
required under federal fisheries law, she said it failed to protect
fish habitat and to reduce bycatch, which is also required by the
statute.
</P>
<P>
   Zeke Grader, executive director of Pacific Coast Federation of
Fishermen's Associations, said the report identifies key issues,
but fails to point out threats to salmon species from dams, logging
and other terrestrial activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, we could close the fishery altogether, and
still it would decline because of all the other factors that are
impacting them,'' he said.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 23. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big stories are about the promise of good things, foreign
and domestic. The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and New York
Times lead with a Mideast peace deal apparently almost in sight.
USA Today fronts that but leads with hints from top Federal Reserve
officials that the Fed is likely to cut interest rates again next
month. The paper quotes the Fed's vice-chairman and three other
officials to the effect that the central bank is intent on keeping
credit loose enough to prevent a slowdown in the U.S. economy. The
Wall Street Journal flags the Fed scenario in its front-page news
box.
</P>
<P>
   The WP, NYT and LAT report that starting Thursday afternoon,
Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat entered into intense
one-on-one bargaining. Everybody writes that the U.S.-backed
land-for-peace deal has been basically accepted. The papers also
say the two parties have arrived at compromises regarding the
Palestinian National Covenant (which currently calls for the
destruction of Israel), the arrest of suspects wanted in Israel and
the release of Palestinians from Israeli jails, but that the issue
of whether or not Arafat might declare the territory he administers
an independent state still remained a sore point. The papers report
that the discussions are being conducted under the rule that no
agreed-to provisions would be final until an overall agreement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and LAT have the most physical details about what went
on behind closed doors, right down to seating arrangements. The two
papers report that Thursday night, President Clinton, who had been
at the summit all day (accompanied, notes the LAT, by Buddy)
invited King Hussein of Jordan to join the talks and that once
there, the king delivered an impassioned speech calling on
Netanyahu and Arafat to press for peace. The papers report that the
deal being worked out involves a finishing-touches meeting a few
months from now, probably in the Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip,
with Clinton in attendance. This has not been confirmed by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reports the LAT, on the West Bank, dozens of Israeli
settlers blocked roads and held prayer rituals to drive home their
demands that no more land be returned to Palestinian control. And,
adds the paper, Palestinians pressing for the repatriation of their
relatives in Israeli jails took to Gaza streets. And three Jewish
parents who lost children to terrorist attacks began a hunger
strike outside Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT's Column One notes a trend among those arrested for
Internet porn: they have a disproportionate tendency to kill
themselves. Of the 34 Americans arrested in a Sept. 3, 14-nation
child porn raid, reports the paper, four have since offed
themselves. The suicides tend to be respectables who've never
previously been in any kind of trouble and are desperate to escape
the impending humiliation, like the former Air Force pilot in Maine
who asphyxiated himself, the University of Connecticut
microbiologist who slashed his wrists, or the Colorado computer
consultant who shot himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Both the NYT and WP report that, according to a study released
Thursday, 1.4 million black men _ 13 percent of all black men _ are
ineligible to vote in the election next month because of a felony
conviction. The Post says this is seven times the national average.
The study found that the proportion of black males in prison has
increased 10 times faster than for white men over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ Washington Wire reports that Ken Starr's investigators
are looking into whether or not Linda Tripp's tapes were doctored.
A NYT op-ed by former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste
makes the observation that Starr's ardor about the tapes apparently
has its limits: he never, for instance, called Lucianne Goldberg
before his grand jury. The reason, Ben-Veniste suggests, is that
her testimony might reveal that Starr knew about the tapes before
he swears he first heard of them _ which could suggest a working
relationship with Paula Jones' legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into a WP Style section story by Michael Powell on the
South Carolina governor's race is this sentence: ``He's angered the
Bubba vote, the black vote, the gambling vote and the anti-gambling
vote and all that in just in the past few months.'' Notice that you
can't defend the usage here by observing that many people actually
use the B-word, because a lot of those folks also use the N-word,
which the Post would never run. No, this is a perfect illustration
of the truism that there's still one group in this country that
``respectable'' people, even (especially?) sophisticated newspaper
people, are allowed to slander _ Southern white males. Hey,
Posties, time to rework that style-sheet.

 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Here are four ideas for terrific Halloween costumes that require
minimal effort and no sewing.
 ``TALKING GHOST''  
 &HT;    Add sound effects to your ghost costume this year. It's easy. Be
sure to have the camcorder ready for this one.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    White sheet
 &HT;    White belt or length of white rope
 &HT;    Mini tape recorder with cassette tape and batteries
 &HT;    Packing tape
 &HT;    Pots and pans
 &HT;    Chains (you can use the chains on the swings at the park)
 &HT;    Fanny pack
 &HT;    Before Halloween, fill a cassette tape with haunted, spooky
noises. Just turn the recorder on and create creepy sounds: rattle
chains (try shaking the chains on the park swings), scrape together
pots and pans, scream, moan and groan. Let the whole family get in
on the act.
 &HT;    To create the ghost costume, simply cut holes for the eyes,
making them large enough for the child to see through easily.
Secure the cassette player (with cassette inserted) in the fanny
pack and place it around your child's waist.
 &HT;    Place the sheet over his or her head, aligning eye holes and
allowing hands to stick out. Secure sheet at waist with white belt
or white rope.
 &HT;    ``Blouse'' sheet over belt to shorten length, and to disguise
fanny pack, if needed. Turn on cassette player and get ready to
scare the neighbors.
 PAIR OF DICE  
 &HT;    This is a great costume for siblings.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Large cardboard box
 &HT;    Black non-toxic poster paint
 &HT;    White paper and glue
 &HT;    White glow-in-the dark fabric paint
 &HT;    Cut head and arm holes in a large cardboard box. Cut flaps off
of bottom of box and leave open for child's legs. Paint box black.
 &HT;    When dry, glue on circles of white paper to resemble the dots on
a pair of dice. Add white glow-in-the dark fabric paint to the dots
for a more dazzling after-dark effect.
 FLOWER POWER  
 &HT;    Here's a simple but cheerful costume.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Adult-sized stretchy headband
 &HT;    Two or more different colors of felt
 &HT;    Hot-glue gun
 &HT;    Green turtleneck
 &HT;    Black or green leggings or sweatpants
 &HT;    Black or green shoes
 &HT;    Washable fabric glue
 &HT;    Cut felt into petal shapes. Using a glue gun, attach petals to
the headband. Allow glue to set.
 &HT;    Place headband around child's face to make a flower. Have the
child put on the green turtleneck, green leggings and brown shoes.
Glue additional petals to bottom of sleeves of turtleneck with
washable fabric glue, so turtleneck can be washed and worn again.
 SCARECROW  
 &HT;    Your trick-or-treater will be ready for the yellow brick road in
this costume.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Big long-sleeved T-shirt or flannel shirt
 &HT;    Jeans or sweat pants
 &HT;    A flannel or straw hat
 &HT;    Brown burlap or fabric for around head
 &HT;    Black or brown felt for ``booties''
 &HT;    Iron-on patches
 &HT;    Rope or twine for waist and wrists
 &HT;    Straw
 &HT;    Stuff straw in the wrists of the shirt, either taping the ends
on the inside of the shirt sleeve or using a loose rope around the
child's wrist. Do the same around pants legs.
 &HT;    Stuff clothes with more straw. Use black or brown felt or fabric
to make ``booties'' to cover up sneakers. You can also arrange
straw to stick out of holes cut in the jeans or sweat pants.
 &HT;    A dark flannel or straw hat tops the look.

   ``Odgen Nash was onto something when he observed that progress

long,'' begins Glicksman in this humorous essay. She fondly recalls
the days when ``a laptop was where you sat a child'' and ``a
compatible interface was what you hoped for on blind dates.''
Echoing the frustration of many a PC user, she wonders, ``Why can't

 &HT;     (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into
the ``l'' and ``b'' files.)  
 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.
</P>

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.

   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

RETIRING EARLY TO ENJOY MIDDLE AGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, when my sister-in-law Lee was turning 40, she
made this announcement: ``I plan to retire on Dec. 31, 1999. I will
not work in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bold remark.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since, much as a bird builds its nest one twig at a
time, Lee has been methodically laying the foundations for her
future life _ retirement that would begin long before 50.
</P>
<P>
   She left the large firm where she was one of many in-house
lawyers, started her own law firm in Washington, wrote a legal
reference book that promises a long stream of income and taught her
sharp young hires how to run the firm and land new clients.
</P>
<P>
   She got into stocks and mutual funds early in the bull market
and stayed with them. She has been relentless, and I'm confident
that when the millennium comes, there will indeed be one less
person practicing law in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   My sister-in-law, of course, is not alone. Plenty of people have
subdued the economic monsters of living expenses, their children's
college educations and retirement savings and realized that they
don't have to wait until they are in their 60s to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   And they are all not chief executives or Wall Street whizzes.
Many, like Lee, are smart people who had a plan and simply stuck
with it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fantasies of middle age is having the chance to enjoy
it. We have worked hard, and the thought that we will have to toil
for 10 or 20 more years before claiming our reward can be
depressing. I know that I would love to wrap up my career in about
10 years, when I'm 56, but I also know that I probably won't be
able to afford to.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Hollister, a partner with the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in Cincinnati, says she hears talk of early retirement all
the time, as more and more clients chase the dream. Recently, she
had to give a lesson in economic reality to a group of workers at a
factory in the Southwest after dozens of them, having seen the
value of their 401(k) plans jump, began considering such a move.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is this: You have to start planning early and saving
early. And you have to understand that if you retire when you are,
say, 50, you might need to finance a retirement that will last as
many years as your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out how to pay our children's college costs is scary
enough, but as Ms. Hollister pointed out, ``There are no
scholarships for retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't worry someone else who is planning an early
retirement _ a 41-year-old consultant in Manhattan who is married
with two children. He started making his retirement plans when he
was 33 and wants to have about $5 million in assets by the time
he's 50, when he plans to retire. And he says he will achieve his
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes financial discipline,'' said the consultant, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``You have to approach saving like
you would paying a mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives frugally, owning two older cars and a modest house, and
pours much of his and his wife's salaries into a combination of
stocks, bonds and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about financial independence,'' he said. ``It just
means that at 50, I want to have flexibility. I don't want to have
to have a job to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is married and has no children, also decided to forgo a
grand house; instead, she invested the money she would have paid in
higher mortgage payments into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in Washington 16 years, and I still live in a
condo,'' she said. ``I haven't had huge housing expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   She also decided that she could earn a lot more by working for
herself, in her own law practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took the cap off my income level,'' she said. ``It also
eliminated debt from my life.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ms. Hollister how much I would need to retire in 10
years and still put my four children through college. She ran my
numbers through her computer. Her short answer: $2.1 million. Her
somewhat longer answer: Forget it, you'll never make it.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe some people can. Ms. Hollister offered a rough formula
to find out. First, assume that your retirement will begin in 10
years and last for 30 years, that your investments will earn a 4
percent real, or inflation-adjusted, annual return and that
inflation will be a steady 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   To estimate how much you'll need in savings on the day you
retire, multiply your current annual expenses by 26.6 _ a number
she derived in complex calculations from the assumptions above,
based on the present and future value of money.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, you have $100,000 a year in expenses, you will
need to set aside $2.66 million to join my sister-in-law _ who, by
the way, doesn't plan to just lie on the beach. To her, retiring
early means having the freedom to make her next move without
economic pressure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to retire early so I can stop doing what I am
doing,'' Lee said. ``I want to retire early so I can start doing
things I am not yet doing. I have the feeling that the ability to
do new things will diminish if I wait.''

WHEN NOBODY HAS THE NUMBER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were still using telephone party lines in the late 1960s when
a mentally retarded woman in my small Midwestern town dialed
information and asked for my mother's number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to call Karen,'' said the woman, who can here be
identified only as Wanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karen who?'' the operator inquired. ``What's her last name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Wanda replied. ``Just Karen.''
</P>
<P>
   The operator asked questions like a razor-sharp detective's,
pieced together her clues and somehow delivered the correct number.
</P>
<P>
   In the gee-whiz technology of the 1990s, the party line is long
gone. So too, it seems, is Wanda's operator.
</P>
<P>
   As most anyone who uses directory assistance knows, the operator
often does not have the number these days, especially for
long-distance calls. This is largely because there is no single
clearinghouse of America's telephone listings, and there is
precious little sharing of numbers among the companies that have
their own lists or data bases.
</P>
<P>
   For people who depend on directory assistance, the paucity of
information can mean a tortuous journey through the telephone
twilight zone _ and typically at about $1 a long-distance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In this dimension, things that seemed certain to exist upon last
sighting _ a school, a police station, a church _ a grandmother,
for goodness' sake _ suddenly leave no telephonic trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minneapolis Public Library, please,'' was my request to
directory assistance one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' chirped the operator. ``No listing for a public
library in Minneapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please check again _ maybe it's listed as a municipal
library.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No library in Minneapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Minneapolis is a big city. It's got to have a library.
Don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one that's listed, sir. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   Another time I requested the number of a local church.
</P>
<P>
   ``No listing,'' said the operator. ``Maybe it's new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was new,'' I couldn't resist replying, ``in 1897.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Ma Bell. She knew just about
everybody's number. But since Congress broke up the telephone
monopoly in the 1980s, phone companies have been left with their
own directory lists, which they guard jealously.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the owners to
release these lists at a ``reasonable'' cost, but AT&AMP;T, for
example, says it refuses to pay the prices most local phone
companies ask and is trying to negotiate lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is using lists compiled from other sources,
like the white pages, which can be out of date. Moreover, with some
services centralized, a question about a phone number in Milwaukee
may go to an operator sitting in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the problem exists,'' said Howard McNally, a vice
president of AT&AMP;T who is in charge of directory assistance. He says
the accuracy rate is nearly 95 percent, adding, ``Things will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T now has a new service called ``Double 0 Info'' guaranteeing
that consumers will talk to a real live person _ and for as long as
it takes to get an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Callers can also develop their own strategies for coping in the
world of directory assistance. They can demand to speak to a
supervisor, who is more likely to go the extra mile to find a
missing number.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick is simply to hang up and call directory assistance
again, in the hope that the next operator will be more savvy. (The
cost of the extra call can often be recovered by reporting
unsatisfactory service to the phone company.)
</P>
<P>
   But for many Americans, getting a simple telephone number can
still be an adventure. In some cases, the long-distance operator
will come up empty, put the caller on hold, dial the local exchange
to get the number and then give it to the caller. And that's if
you're lucky.
</P>
<P>
   I have a running feud with directory-assistance operators about
the area code in which I live, an issue that comes up when I am out
of town. The computer apparently insists that my town, Sycamore,
Ill., has two area codes: 815 (the correct one) and 708.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody familiar with the geography of northern Illinois knows
that the 708 area hugs Chicago. My town, on the other hand, is deep
in cornfield country, 65 miles and two area codes away. But to an
operator sitting in Florida, I might as well be talking about Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cooper, a spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America,
sizes up post-Ma Bell progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the breakup, information was an unbilled service in
which you got a person,'' Cooper said. ``Now you pay for it, and
you often get a computer.''

 Mark Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. His column on investment
strategies will appear every other week.  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, particularly in the way
that investment advisers have co-opted the term ``contrarian
analysis'' without really understanding it.
</P>
<P>
   As originally used a half-century ago, the term referred to a
discipline of independent thinking that resisted Wall Street's
latest fads and fashions. It is just such independent thinking that
has helped investors resist, say, becoming fully invested at market
tops and going to cash at bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   But most advisers who say they are contrarians today bear little
resemblance to the originals. Reflexively, they do the opposite of
what they perceive to be the majority belief, thus overlooking the
possibility that the majority might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Contrarian analysis has become what it was intended to overcome:
a fad. Adviser after adviser claims that he is alone in his
analysis, and is thus correct, according to today's peculiar
contrarian logic. What doesn't occur to such knee-jerk contrarians
is that they don't have even remotely similar forecasts. So they
can't all be right.
</P>
<P>
   The father of contrarian analysis, as far as I can tell, is a
Vermonter named Humphrey Neill, who, beginning in the late 1940s,
published the Neill Letters of Contrary Opinion. Neill would
strenuously disagree with today's contrarians when they assume that
the majority is always wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As Neill argued, though the majority ``is wrong at the terminals
of trends,'' it ``is right, on the average, during the trends.''
Furthermore, because the market spends more time during a trend
than at turning points, it follows that the majority is correct
more of the time than not.
</P>
<P>
   My research into the average recommended equity exposure among
investment newsletter editors confirms that Neill was right. The
peak of their bullishness came in early 1985, when the Dow Jones
industrial average was around 1,250 and their recommended equity
exposure was 83 percent. To be sure, many advisers were burned by
the 1987 crash. But that was nearly three years and 1,500 points
later. Knee-jerk contrarians, who were in cash in 1985, missed out
on one of history's great bull-market runs.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of investment newsletters are more bearish today
than they've been in years. I calculate that from a peak of around
70 percent in July, the average recommended equity exposure has
dropped to as low as 14 percent. Knee-jerk contrarians insist that
this is a positive sign. Maybe it is. But the bearishness may also
be presaging a deeper decline.
</P>
<P>
   So what good is Neill's approach as a short-term market-timing
tool? Not much. But Neill never claimed it was. And he went out of
his way to tell readers as much.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may pay a high price for ignoring that. Consider
Contrarian's View, a newsletter that in recent years has been
bearish. I calculate that since the beginning of 1991, its model
portfolios have produced an annualized return of just 3.4 percent,
versus 17.2 percent for the Wilshire 5000, a broad market index.
</P>
<P>
   An even higher price has been paid by adherents to the Natural
Contrarian, which has bet heavily on gold-mining companies. I
calculate that since the beginning of last year, a portfolio of its
most recommended stocks has lost more than 50 percent on an
annualized basis.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean you should always invest with the majority.
That strategy won't always work either, since there are other
periods _ particularly when the market changes course _ when
contrarian approaches will succeed. Furthermore, some contrarian
approaches actually beat the market over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Investors Intelligence, a newsletter that uses
contrarian analysis to time the market. Though it has lagged behind
the market since I began tracking it in 1985 _ returning 13.4
percent a year, on average, versus 16 percent for the Wilshire 5000
_ it did so with less than half the risk _ a winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from all this? There is no substitute for independent
thinking. Remember too, the modesty of Neill's claims for his
approach: ``It is plainly nothing more than developing the habit of
doing what every textbook on learning advises, namely, to look at
both sides of all questions.''

NOT ALL SCIENCE PRIZES ARE EQUALLY NOBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year I nervously await the announcements of the Nobel
prizes in various fields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not because I ever expect to win one but, rather,
because each year I learn anew just how ignorant I am. And it helps
to keep me humble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may, if you wish, pretend you were aware that physicists
Horst L. Stormer, Daniel C. Tsui and Bertrand I. Halperin had spent
years working on a phenomenon known as the fractional quantum Hall
effect. But I will admit to anyone who asks that I was clueless
about this surprising work, which has to do with how electrons
behave. (Sometimes oddly _ even naughtily.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that other physicists say the work of these three new
Nobel prize winners in physics has no practical application. I find
it embarrassing to realize that such compelling work in physics and
other fields can be going on while I'm deeply ignorant of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus I also was caught by surprise when the Nobel prize in
economics this year was given to a man unknown to me doing
important work of which I'd also never heard. He's Amartya K. Sen,
a native of India who teaches at Trinity College in Cambridge,
England (the tiny country where Prince Charles lives). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, I lived for two years in India, and it seems
to me that, had I really been paying attention, I might at least
have picked up some news of Sen's pioneering work on the causes of
poverty, famine and other deprivations. But, alas, I was in the
dark until the Nobel folks in Stockholm made the announcement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of my distress about this, however, is mitigated each year
when I learn the winners of the annual Ig Nobel prizes, presented
at Harvard University about the time the Nobel prizes are
announced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ig Nobel ceremony is produced by a science humor magazine,
``Annals of Improbable Research'' (point your browser to
www.improbable.com), edited by Marc Abrahams, a funny fellow I
know. Co-sponsors of the event are the Harvard Computer Society,
the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and _ who else? _
Manco, a company that sells a brand of duct tape called Duck Tape. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, as always, the winners were scientists who spent an
inordinate amount of time on research that, well, sounds bizarre.
But in defense of these researchers, let me tell you that the only
reason their work sounds bizarre is because it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Ig Nobel prize this year in ``Safety
Engineering'' went to a Canadian named Troy Hurtubise for
developing and personally testing a suit of armor that is
impervious to grizzly bears. How handy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, in fact, did well in the Ig Nobels this year. Two
statisticians _ one from Toronto, one from Alberta _ won a prize
for a paper published in the ``Annals (two n's) of Sex Research''
called ``The Relationship Among Height, Penile Length and Foot
Size.'' (No more about this later.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you see why _ even if I'm unhappy being ignorant of the real
Nobels _ I am pleased to learn of my ignorance about such areas of
research? If I knew that this work was going on while it was
actually under way, I might be tempted to go to Canada, find these
people and slap a little sense into them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all of them. Some of the Ig Nobel winners do good
work. It just sounds silly. For instance, the Ig Nobel medicine
prize this year went to some staff members at a hospital in Wales
for a paper in a medical journal that described their treatment of
``a man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for five
years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they solved the problem of ``a decompositional
process,'' so the guy smells better now. In fact, I bet he has a
better aroma than that emanating from some of the scientific
research being done hither and yon. &QL;
</P>

<P>
   It is hardly surprising that people scratch their heads over a
mutual fund like PBHG Advisor Defensive Equity. The fact that it
gets 30 percent of its returns from options summons up notions of
all kinds of derivatives-fueled volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fund, with $51.2 million in assets, is actually a tame
offering. Indeed, it has not posted a loss in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore that safety, the fund changed its name from
Optioned Equity two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fixated on the word `option,' '' explained Harindra de
Silva, the fund's co-manager, from his downtown Los Angeles office.
``But we use options the way they were originally designed _ to
hedge, not to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive Equity lost just 6.7 percent between the market peak
on July 17 and Oct. 16, compared with losses of 10.1 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and 12.3 percent for the
average fund in its peer group of large-cap blend funds, according
to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But hedging has been a drag on performance during the bull
market. In the three years through Oct. 16, the fund returned 18.1
percent, versus 24.4 percent for the S&AMP;P and 18.6 percent for the
peer group.
</P>
<P>
   For such markets, de Silva and his co-manager, Dennis M. Bein,
also run the $19.3 million PBHG Advisor Enhanced Equity fund, an
unhedged version of its sibling. That fund returned 26 percent for
the three years through Oct. 16, versus 24.4 percent for the S&AMP;P
and 17.1 percent for the peer group, according to Morningstar.
(Because of its small asset size, Enhanced Equity is not included
in the mutual fund tables of The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   De Silva, 38, and Bein, 31, began running Defensive Equity in
1996 with its original manager, Charles Dobson, who retired this
year. The pair use an investment approach derived from the work of
their former teacher, Robert Haugen, a finance professor at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most money managers try to pick individual stocks,'' de Silva
said. ``We don't believe that works, because the market is too
efficient. But we can build a portfolio with the profile of a
perfect stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a personal computer, stocks are rated by dozens of
measures, which fall into five categories. The first assesses
value, using measures like price-to-earnings ratios. The second
does the same for profitability, using earnings growth rates, among
others. The third tracks risk, using factors like volatility. And
the fourth measures liquidity, taking note of trading volume and
other figures.
</P>
<P>
   The screening gets trickier in the final measurement: historical
returns. De Silva and Bein seek out stocks whose returns fit a
profile that they say points to superior future returns. Ideally,
they look for a stock with a poor one-month return, which suggests
that the shares will be relatively cheap; a strong one-year return,
indicating good price momentum, and a poor five-year return. ``That
adds a contrarian flavor,'' Bein said.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the discipline is that they need not find ``perfect''
stocks that fit each ideal parameter. Instead, they require only
that their total portfolio's blended average does so.
</P>
<P>
   How do they put it all together? By using what they call an
optimization process that crunches the data they collect to build a
portfolio of 70 to 100 names from the S&AMP;P 500 that together have
such ideal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a sampling of different measurements from three of its
top stocks as of Oct. 16. On that date, American International
Group had a P/E of 23.3 and per-share earnings growth of 14.1
percent. The stock lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by 1.1 percentage points over
the last five years and by 3.7 percentage points for the 12-month
period _ the latter return indicating bad price momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech had a P/E of 15.38 and per-share earnings growth of
29.2 percent. It's stock beat the S&AMP;P 500 by 24 percentage points
during the last 12 months and 3.3 percentage points during the last
five years _ the high five-year return indicating bad contrarian
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in McDonald's, with a P/E of 27.03 and per-share earnings
growth of 7.6 percent _ a sign of poor growth prospects. It lagged
the S&AMP;P 500 by 6.7 percentage points over the past five years, but
beat it by 7.2 percentage points over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The weighted average of these three stocks stacks up quite
attractively against the S&AMP;P 500. The three stock portfolio has a
P/E of 22.4 percent versus the S&AMP;P 500's 32.64 percent, indicating
better valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Per-share earnings growth is 16 percent, better than the index's
11.4 percent. The portfolio lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by 2 percentage
points over the past five years, giving it a strong potential for
rebounding, but beat it by 9 percentage points over the last 12
months, indicating strong price momentum, Bein said.
</P>
<P>
   How do de Silva and Bein take advantage of options? The two
managers write, or sell, call options, which give purchasers the
right to buy stock at an agreed-upon price, called the strike
price, within a certain time, from less than a day to several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The managers make money if the stock price stays flat or moves
no higher than the strike price _ a simple defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the option income as steady dividend payments, Bein
said. ``It's like a high dividend-paying stock fund, without the
vulnerability of owning a big chunk of utilities stocks,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's front-end load, or sales charge, of 5.75 percent will
be waived indefinitely starting Monday.

<P>
   Some deaf parents would use genetic testing to ensure that their
child is also deaf. A small minority of deaf people would even
consider aborting a hearing child.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of society views deafness as a disability, some
deaf people take the view that they belong to a different, equally
valid culture. To gauge attitudes among deaf people, Anna
Middleton, a genetic counselor at St James's University Hospital in
Leeds, England, surveyed delegates at the Deaf Nation conference at
the University of Central Lancashire in 1997. This group argues
that deaf people have a distinct cultural and political identity.
</P>
<P>
   Many delegates declined to participate in the study. Of the 87
people who took part, just over half believed genetic testing would
do more harm than good. In a similar survey of the general
population, just 21 percent shared this negative view.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen percent of the deaf people who responded said that they
might use prenatal genetic testing. But one-third of this group _
five people _ said they would prefer to have deaf children (The
American Journal of Human Genetics, vol. 63, p. 1,175).
</P>
<P>
   Middleton admits that there may have been a bias in the sample
of conference delegates, so she is now analyzing a further survey
of 600 deaf people recruited in a variety of other ways. But she is
still finding a small proportion who say they might abort a hearing
child.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not restricted to the deaf, says Clair Francomano,
a geneticist at the National Institutes of Health near Washington
D.C. Following the 1994 discovery of the genes that cause
achondroplasia _ a form of dwarfism _ several couples contacted
Francomano to see if they could guarantee having a baby that would
inherit the parents' short stature. &QL;

 &HT;    Bar houses the bravery, grace, history of toreros
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The men began to gather in their special section
of the bar about 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   This bar, like the historic hotel that embraces it, is dedicated
to these men and their profession.
</P>
<P>
   The men are toreros _ professional bull men.
</P>
<P>
   Such men must have had similar gathering places in ancient Crete
and imperial Rome where they also were honored.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Madrid, the men gather in Bar Manolete in the Grand
Hotel Reina Victoria. When they talk about fearless bullfighters,
heroic bulls or celebrated bullfights, they can point to nearby
photographs and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men in the bar must be in the photographs. If they
are not in the photographs, they surely were there when the picture
was taken. And if not that, then their fathers or grandfathers had
been there and these men can repeat those old stories as if they
had seen it all with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The men tell their stories under the watchful gaze of some of
Spain's most storied bulls, whose magnificent heads are mounted in
ferocious posterity on the surrounding walls.
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria was built on the site of an ancient palace. It is
located in the heart of Madrid on the Plaza de Santa Ana where
Madrilenos exercise their purebred dogs, browse nearby shops and
linger over tapas and raciones in the surrounding bars and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hotel where today's top bullfighters stay before
they engage in a bullfight in the world's most famous Plaza de
Toros not far away.
</P>
<P>
   Bullfighters in Spain are like rock stars. They are wealthy,
famous and glamorous. But unlike rock stars, they have a bearing
and dignity that commands respect.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who oppose bullfighting view the spectacle as an
unfair contest between a man and a bull. Done properly, the
struggle is not unfair. Bulls are bred for strength, stamina and
aggressive instincts.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the contest is not between a man and a bull
but between a man and himself.
</P>
<P>
   The real contest is the matador's daring and grace while risking
his life with each pass of the bull's deadly horns.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone in Bar Manolete will tell you, Juan Belmonte
revolutionized bullfighting nearly 100 years ago when he stood
still and emphasized bravery and graceful capework over the killing
of the bull.
</P>
<P>
   In his novel ``Death in the Afternoon,'' Ernest Hemingway wrote
that Belmonte ``would wind a bull around him like a belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1700, more than 40 of the 125 major matadors have been
killed in the bullring.
</P>
<P>
   Belmonte and his friend Joselito were considered two of the
greatest bullfighters of all time. Joselito was killed in the ring
in 1920. Belmonte was gored more than 50 times but survived to
retire at age 43 in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The matador that the bar was named after, Manolete, is generally
considered the greatest successor to Belmonte and Joselito. He was
the epitome of skill unflappable bravery. Manolete, too, was killed
in the bullring.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest matador I ever watched was El Cordobes, or Manolo.
He was the star of opening ceremonies in Mexico City's huge Plaza
de Toros more than 30 years ago. That day I bought tickets on the
shady side and cheered his amazing courage along with every other
voice in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   El Cordobes did not have the skill or grace of Manolete. But no
matador ever had more courage. Amazingly, El Cordobes did not die
in the ring. He retired in 1972 as a Spanish national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to have a drink with some of the bravest men alive,
go to Bar Manolete in the Grand Hotel Reina Victoria in Madrid.

 &HT;    Groundbreaking for concrete skate park planned
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Although they're hardly criminals, Jason Lewis
and his friends have grown used to dodging police.
</P>
<P>
   Like many skateboarders across the Miami Valley, Lewis and his
friends find themselves constantly looking for new spots where they
can work on their tricks, or grinds, without being confronted, if
not detained, by police who confiscate their prized skateboards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Middletown officials, in cooperation with a Monroe
concrete company and an Athens, Ohio, designer, will take a major
step toward giving the community's skateboard enthusiasts a legal
place to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait. I'll use that everyday,'' said Lewis, 16. ``I
looked at the plans. It's going to be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the city government, Baker Concrete Construction
Co. and skateboarders will gather from 8:30 to 11 a.m. Saturday at
Smith Park, near the municipal airport, to clean up the park and
break ground for the city's concrete skateboard park.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown's will be the second public skate park to become a
reality in the Miami Valley. The other is a temporary facility set
up set up outside Hobart Arena in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   But others are recognizing the trend _ and the need. In Yellow
Springs, fund raising is under way for a park to be constructed in
1999 behind the John Bryan Community Center. And the Countryside
YMCA in Lebanon is close to jumping on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, that age group (teen-agers) is normally the group that
kind of disappears. It's a tough age. I think we need to create
programs and activities more geared to that group,'' said Stephen
Boland of the Countryside YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why our group is so eager. That, and it's a
fast-growing sport across the country,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, Mel Durand began designing portable
rails used in performing skateboard tricks with his son, Aaron, a
professional skateboarder. Now the Durands run Suburban Rails, the
company donating the design of the Middletown park.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it wasn't being well-built. It's dangerous if it's
not built properly,'' said Durand, who has coached youth baseball,
soccer and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skaters need parks. They're treated like criminals in a lot of
towns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just athletes like any other. The only difference is
they're not good team players. They like to do their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Middletown's park never would have become a reality without the
contribution of Baker Concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The company has pledged the materials and labor for the concrete
park, as well as a maintenance fund to cover the costs of upkeep
and repairs. On Saturday, the company will help coordinate the
clean-up and groundbreaking as part of an event held in recognition
of Make a Difference Day established by USA Weekend magazine. Lunch
and refreshments will be provided, as well as a safety seminar for
skaters.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 13, Durand met with Lewis and other skateboarders at
Middletown city hall to discuss the park's design.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, police began enforcing a city ordinance
barring bicycles and in-line skates, as well as skateboards, from
the city plaza and City Center Mall area. But after the meeting,
Durand and the youths walked the prohibited areas for design ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Middletown City Commission accepted the plan,
after learning the city's insurance company had agreed to include
the park in the city's insurance coverage _ at a higher premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of communities looking into this,'' said Denise
Bolton, the city's recreation administrator. ``Insurance companies
are taking another look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Miami Valley parks, Bolton said there are two
public facilities in Columbus and one in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Durand said there are 20 to 40 cement parks in the United
States, and 100 in the planning stages, mostly on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Middletown park is completed, Lewis and his friends
will continue skating wherever they can. Lately, they've been
gathering almost nightly around a local school and church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of my friends skateboards or Rollerblades. I
love the sport. It's fun,'' he said.

 &HT;    Charges of discrimination lodged against home rental firm;
lawsuit filed
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Miami Valley Fair Housing Center has sued
Huber Home Rentals saying it discriminates against families with
children by dictating what size house they can rent.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCarthy, the center's executive director, said the center
received two complaints in 1997 from parents who said they were
told they would have to rent larger houses. Undercover
investigators for the center were told the same thing, McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Huber Home Rentals in Huber Heights declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Huber Home Rentals is one of the area's largest landlords, the
housing center said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that in June 1997 a Huber Home Rentals agent
told a single mother of four that company policy prohibited her
from renting a three-bedroom townhouse and she would have to move
into a four-bedroom house. Another agent told a family with five
children looking at a four-bedroom house in September 1997 that
company policy required them to rent a five-bedroom house,
according to the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover investigators posing as renters were told the same
thing on six different occasions in June and July 1997, McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the
sale or rental of housing based on race, color, sex, religion or
national origin. The act was amended in 1988 to include disability
or having children in the household.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines say two people per bedroom is a reasonable
occupancy level, but Huber Home Rentals attempts to steer families
to larger and more expensive units, said Christine White, education
coordinator for the Fair Housing Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center, Housing Opportunities Made Equal Inc., Toylyn
Caldwell of Dayton and Danny and Michele Tolson of Germantown,
Tenn., filed the lawsuit. The Tolsons and Caldwell are the parents
who filed the complaints with the center. HOME is a Cincinnati
organization that conducts undercover investigations of unfair
housing complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Both Caldwell and the Tolson family had to live with relatives
for several months as a result of Huber Home Rentals discriminatory
practices, the lawsuit says. Eventually, the Tolsons moved to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks for $1,070,000 in damages as well as a court
order barring Huber Home Rentals from discriminatory practices
</P>
<P>
   Huber Home Rentals is owned by Huber Investment Corp., which
owns more than 2,000 parcels in Montgomery County. McCarthy said
Huber Investment also owns properties in Cincinnati. Charles Huber
Sr. is the majority owner, he said. The Huber family developed much
of what is now Huber Heights.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said he has heard complaints about Huber Home Rentals
for years about several issues, including complaints about security
deposit refunds, and complaints that it discourages tenants from
moving into smaller units, and requires potential tenants to sign
``agreements to rent'' and put down security deposits before
signing eases.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley Fair Housing Center, formed in 1993, is a
private, non-profit corporation that contracts with Kettering,
Montgomery County and the Affordable Housing Fund to help eliminate
unfair housing practices.

 &HT;    Texas students occupy building to force dialogue
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As police sealed off the premises, University of
Texas students occupied the Main Building recently, vowing to spend
the night if necessary to protest what they called a lack of
commitment by UT officials to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   One student who tried to enter the building, known as the Tower,
after it was locked around 5 p.m. was carried out in handcuffs,
while another 30 students bringing food were denied entry.
Occupying students also were refused access to the restrooms, but
officials later relented.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of affirmative action at Texas colleges brought on by
the 1996 federal court's Hopwood decision has been a hotly
contested issue at UT. But this school year had been quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Students began their occupation after a brief meeting with UT
President Larry Faulkner at which he refused to sign a letter
saying he would meet with them at a specific date to respond to
their demands. They are asking officials to reinstate affirmative
action in virtually all parts of the university and to hold regular
town-hall meetings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted was Dr. Faulkner to say he would respond to our
letter and have an open forum and set up a date,'' said Jemima
Pierre, a member of the newly formed Anti-Racist Organizing
Committee. ``He shunned us.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said that, instead of signing the handwritten document,
he gave his word to the students that he would meet with them to
discuss the Hopwood ruling, which UT is appealing. ``I think it's
unfortunate they seem not to perceive we are on the same side and
committed to the same ends,'' he said in an interview after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre said an oral agreement was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although Faulkner has only been in office since April,
pro-affirmative action UT students have long been suspicious of how
committed UT officials are to overturning Hopwood. UT regents _ not
all of whom support affirmative action _ said they were appealing
the ruling because UT was at a disadvantage in competing for bright
minority students and needed a level playing field. Students said
that meant regents would be satisfied even if the U.S. Supreme
Court banned affirmative action in every state.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the student organizing committee and some lawyers have
argued that Hopwood only affects admissions to the UT School of
Law, the lawsuit's target. However, Attorney General Dan Morales
and others have interpreted the ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals broadly, arguing that it not only affects the law
school but public and private schools as well as scholarships and
other student programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has had every opportunity to reinterpret Dan
Morales' opinion,'' said J. Reed, another student committee member.
``The fact that they haven't proves our argument that we are
skeptical about their commitment to affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Pierre, among those occupying the building, vowed not
to leave until Faulkner signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, interviewed at a building dedication on campus, said
he understood students' passions and was not inclined to discipline
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Building, which usually stays open until 11 p.m., was
sealed off ``for security reasons,'' university police said.
``We're trying to dissolve the demonstration,'' Chief Donald Cannon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, Silas Griggs, said police also were not
allowing anyone in, unless they had a key, to prevent any further
disruption of business.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gordon, an associate professor of anthropology, took the
students' letter and said he would try to locate Faulkner and
negotiate a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, state educational leaders offered several proposals
aimed at beefing up minority enrollment in the wake of the Hopwood
ruling, which triggered a decline in enrollment of black and
Hispanic students at selective Texas schools such as UT.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board tentatively
recommended that the Legislature dramatically increase financial
aid for college-bound students of all races. Board members said
they want to triple financial aid, to $500 million, for the
two-year budget cycle. The state now spends about $122 million.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees and a statewide commission also have
proposed increased scholarship aid, which would help many minority
students, who tend to be needier.

 UNDATED: Buccaneers, 16-10.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (2-5) vs. Tennessee (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bears (42) _ Rushing first downs. Oilers (4-0) _ Vs.
NFC in `97.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Both teams enter on high notes. The Bears upset Dallas
at home by 13-12 and Tennessee smashed Cincinnati by 44-14. The
Oilers' offense finally began to click and show in results what
appears to be so much promise. With Steve McNair at quarterback and
Eddie George in the backfield along with Yancey Thigpen at
receiver, no defense should shut down the Oilers. That is simply
too much talent not to move the football. And now the Oilers are
doing it. George has three 100-yard rushing efforts in his last
four games. Tennessee is 11-4 when George rushes for 100 yards. He
will get that against the Bears and the Oilers prime themselves for
a strong sprint in the season's second half.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (2-4) vs. Oakland (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bengals (2) _ Turnovers committed. Raiders (45.4) _
Donald Hollas' qb rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bengals are a strange franchise and they are having
a strange season. They have committed an NFL-low 2 turnovers this
season. They are plus 5 in turnover differential. Winning the
turnover battle is supposed to mean victories. It is not that way
for the Bengals. Too much shoddy play in other areas. Not enough
big plays in big time. The Raiders are continuing to improve. Their
defense is making wonderful strides. It allowed 381.3 yards per
game in its first six games a year ago. The Raiders have shaved
that to 262.8 yards per game through six this season. That is a
huge jump. Look for Oakland to keep trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-11.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-3) vs. San Diego (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Seahawks (13.2) _ Average. points. allowed. Chargers
(72.0) _ Average. rushing yards. allowed.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: _ Seattle had a bye week to contemplate its furious
start and then dismal skid. The thinking time was much needed. This
is a group of players whose attention span has long been
questioned. Talented, no question, but committed, focused,
prepared? It's been hit or miss with this bunch. June Jones is the
Chargers' new coach and as a result we should continue to see a
more relaxed and improving Ryan Leaf at quarterback. But for Leaf,
this game will provide more growing pains. The Seahawks will be
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (3-3) vs. Carolina (0-6)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bills (10-5) _ Flutie's record as starter. Panthers
(11) _ Kevin Greene sacks.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Buffalo has won three straight and now looks like a
contender in the AFC East. This is a small miracle. There were so
many changes in Buffalo during the offseason _ coach, quarterback,
running back _ that the Bills looked as if they would need a year
just to settle down before being able to truly compete. But fresh
from beating previously unbeaten Jacksonville and from quarterback
Doug Flutie's heroics, Buffalo knows that it is quite capable of
beating most AFC teams. We can't say that about Carolina. What can
be said about the Panthers? High hopes mangled. A quarterback
(Kerry Collins) who was the franchise who is now no longer in town.
A winless team. It remains that way.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (4-2) vs. Kansas City (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Steelers (14.5) _ Average. points. allowed. Chiefs
(7-2) _ Record after byes.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Chiefs have not played since being punished by
40-10 at New England. That will be two weeks and one day by the
time game time rolls around. The Chiefs will be flying around at
home, spurred by the bright lights of Monday night and by the
raucous Chiefs' home crowd. Pittsburgh usually has an answer. The
Steelers are 10-3 under coach Bill Cowher on Monday nights and
often respond when pushed by pushing back. Problem is the Steelers'
offense remains too green to properly answer. This offense simply
has not meshed but should in the weeks to come. Not against the
Chiefs defense, however, which has allowed an average of 10.1
points per game at Arrowhead Stadium in its last 11 games there,
all victories. Chiefs, 23-13.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Women voters are becoming increasingly
turned off in Florida, a new study suggests _ which may help
explain why Democrats have lost control of the state legislature
and trail in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Florida ranked 44th in the nation in voter turnout among women
in the 1992 and 1996 elections, according to an analysis released
Thursday by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington
group. The state was 42nd in women's turnout in a similar report
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If those numbers prove true in the Nov. 3 election, analysts
say, it's bad news for Buddy MacKay, the Democratic candidate for
governor. He trails by 10 points and needs a late surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women make up the larger part of the Democratic party,
particularly older women,'' said Susan MacManus, professor of
political science at the University of South Florida. ``So if there
is a turnout problem, it hurts the Democrats.'' ``I think women are
pretty much discouraged,'' said Charlene Carres, a Tallahassee
attorney who serves on a Florida advisory committee to the
Washington institute. ``I think the lower turnout is partially due
to the way campaigns are run, with 30-second sound bites. When
women are excited by things, they turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's women fared relatively well in some areas: Florida
ranked sixth nationally in women's pay compared to men's, with
women earning 76 cents on the dollar, according to the study. That
was the highest in the Southeast region, except for Washington's
87.5 cents. West Virginia was lowest with 64.8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida ranked 30th out of 50 states and the District of
Columbia in the percentage of female office-holders. As it happens,
all of Florida's 1998 candidates for U.S. senator, governor,
lieutenant governor and five of the six Cabinet positions are men.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, women's voter turnout in Louisiana jumped from 35th
in the country to 18th in part because of a female candidate in a
Senate race there, contends Amy Caiazza, state issues coordinator
for the Institute for Women's Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Registered women voters outnumber men in Florida by 3.2 million
to 2.8 million, but despite all the talk about President Clinton
appealing to female voters in 1996, only 46.6 percent of registered
women voters actually went to the polls, according to the study.
That was well below the national average of 49 percent for women's
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, voter turnout for Florida men, 49.6 percent, was
slightly higher than the national average, 49 percent, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of a research project to measure the status of
women and is financed in part by the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay spokeswoman Michelle Kucera said women's turnout may
appear low partly because of Florida's highly mobile and to some
extent seasonal population, but did not dispute it was important
for the campaign to reach women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the women's vote is very important and we're trying
to do everything we can do to energize women's participation,''
Kucera said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the old assumptions about women favoring the
Democrats are out of date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree if they turn out the women's vote the Democrats
will get it,'' said John Dowless, executive director of the
Christian Coalition of Florida. ``I think they're up for grabs.''
He pointed to heavy participation by women in conservative groups
such Concerned Women for America.
</P>
<P>
   MacManus cautioned that the statistics were based in part on
estimates, so it is possible that the low turnout is somewhat
exaggerated. Caiazza acknowledged that the estimating formula does
run the risk of error, but said the same formula was used for other
states, so it should still provide a helpful picture of where
Florida stands compared to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Division of Elections does not keep voter turnout by
gender, according to an assistant to director Ethel Baxter. The
U.S. Census' 1996 estimates for turnout were not available when the
report was compiled.

 &HT;    SER program director claims he's a fall guy
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The private contractor running the state's
one-stop work force centers designed to help unemployed workers and
their families in Austin is expected to be ousted today in the wake
of federal and state investigations of claims of fraud and records
falsification.
</P>
<P>
   The two centers, run by SER Jobs for Progress Inc. for the past
year, had been touted as a showcase of welfare reform through
privatization of state business.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of accusations by SER work force center employees,
before and after they were fired or resigned in the past six
months, led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor and
the Texas Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Capital Area Workforce Development Board, which
oversees the work force centers, voted to cancel its $4.8 million
annual contract with SER. A private, nonprofit corporation, SER has
collected part of the money for expenses incurred in the first four
months of the current fiscal year, but will get no more of the
undetermined remainder of the $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Rodriguez, SER's local chairman, pleaded unsuccessfully with
the Capital Area Workforce Development Board recently for an
``opportunity to right the ship'' in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was their call, and also their loss,'' Rodriguez said. The
work force development board met for two hours in executive session
before voting 16-2 to demand that SER voluntarily withdraw as
manager of the centers by 2:30 p.m. If not, the board said it will
terminate the contract and SER will forfeit the right to rebid
against others for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Until an interim manager is found, the staff of the work force
development board will continue to operate the two work force
centers, where unemployed workers can get help finding jobs and
register for public aid. Sometime in the next several months, the
board will rebid the project, said Nora Comstock, chairwoman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Development board member Sandy Dochen listed the board's
findings against SER after the executive session. They were:
</P>
<P>
   1. Violations of record keeping and fiscal controls.
</P>
<P>
   2. Failure to abide by the policies and regulations of the
federal Jobs Training Partnership Act.
</P>
<P>
   3. Inadequate monitoring of performance standards.
</P>
<P>
   4. Questions and concerns over the treatment of SER employees.
</P>
<P>
   The violations of record keeping were partly a reference to
employees' claims that clients' records were changed, said
Comstock.
</P>
<P>
   SER employees have claimed they were ordered to hide, delete or
falsely upgrade clients' progress to enhance chances of incentive
pay in the management contract. If so, the record changing didn't
achieve its goal because SER did not exceed performance standards
in any category and hence did not benefit from any incentive pay,
according to development board executive director Martin Aguirre.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring within SER ranks turned caustic as it became
apparent that the board was going to reprimand SER for its
performance in training low-income and unemployed workers in the
Austin work force program.
</P>
<P>
   Safar Gerabagi, executive director of the SER work force
program, claimed he was a target of the dissident employees and
said the SER board was making him a ``sacrificial lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerabagi bitterly complained recently that the local SER board
of directors ``cut a deal'' to remove him as director and settle
formal grievances filed by 10 former employees in connection with
their loss of jobs at the work force centers. Earlier, Gerabagi
read a prepared statement to the work force development board
before board members met in executive session. He said he has been
``judged guilty on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerabagi's public comments before the board appeared to
infuriate Rodriguez, the local SER chairman, who said Gerabagi,
executive director of the SER work force program, was not speaking
for the SER board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This small group of disgruntled employees, desperate to
discredit me for the advancement of their own agendas, have gone to
the press and visited with public officials making wild accusations
but offering no proof,'' Gerabagi said. ``Only one of them claims
she was told to falsify the records . . . but failed to bring her
complaint to me despite her supervisor's instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor, James Moore, said that protocol would have the
employee report the falsification of records to Gerabagi. But in
her case, she risked being fired if she did so, according to Moore,
who is no longer with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the employee called the fraud hot line of the Texas
Workforce Commission. The hot line investigator returned the call
and left a message on her voice mail. She was fired two days later.

   MARTHA-FAITHFUL _ Angela Sarris shows off a bunny Halloween
costume she made for her infant son from a Martha Stewart pattern.
The other members of the Martha Stewart Club ooh and aah over its
preciousness, but for those considering making the costume
themselves, Sarris has one bit of advice. ``I had to add a long
zipper, otherwise, you can't get a child in the costume.'' Such are
the stories at the monthly meeting of the dozen or so Martha
faithfuls. Whether recipe or craft, the idea is great, but the
execution is never quite carried out with the grace and ease Martha
exhibits on her daily television show. ``Maybe it's because she has

 &HT;    Wangrin: UT's Brown makes a Major call
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 1985, Fred Akers had to pick a starter from
between Todd Dodge, the senior who had held the job but struggled
the year before, and Bret Stafford, a promising sophomore. All
through two-a-day practices he hemmed and hawed, pondered and
vacillated, guarding the choice as if it involved divulging nuclear
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the day before the season opener, with one hometown
reporter present, Akers interrupted a brief discussion of recent
revelations of payola at Texas Christian by blurting out . . .
``and Todd Dodge is our No. 1 quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   My scoop-meter piqued, I whipped out my rectangular reporter's
notebook and dutifully recorded his every utterance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Headline the next day: Dodge will lead Horns in opener with
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   After kickoff I focused my binoculars on the sideline and saw .
. . Bret Stafford run out to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Akers hadn't lied. Stafford was guiding the second-team offense
in a two-minute drill, which worked until a holding penalty allowed
Missouri to regroup. Then Akers pulled Stafford and the backups,
replacing them with the first unit led by No. 1 quarterback Dodge,
who wound up alternating series with Stafford all night. The ploy
did not work _ the drive wound up stalling _ except to teach me a
lesson in semantics: No. 1 does not mean starting.
</P>
<P>
   All week long Mack Brown had maintained that he and offensive
coordinator Greg Davis haven't talked about whether Major
Applewhite or Richard Walton, recently returned from a broken hand,
would start against Baylor on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't mean they haven't already decided individually.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, what had been expected, was made official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start Major at quarterback,'' Brown said. ``No. 1, he
deserves it, he's done so well. He's on a roll. Also, it's entirely
too much to ask of Richard Walton (to be ready).''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence had been overwhelming in support of Applewhite:
</P>
<P>
   -Brown's record shows that he will play the quarterback who best
gives them a chance to win that week's game.
</P>
<P>
   -Applewhite IS on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   -Walton, at least in Tuesday's practice, the only one open to
the media this week, did not look sharp.
</P>
<P>
   -Though Brown has talked of Walton's improvement throughout the
week, he has also kept bringing up the soreness in Walton's forearm
and how nobody could expect a player who had been in a cast for
four weeks to be back to form immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Why the delay in announcing a starter? Brown understandably
wouldn't want to crush the feelings of Walton, a fifth-year senior
who had patiently waited four years to take over for James Brown
and is the consummate team player. He also believes firmly that
competition in practice, even if only a pretense, brings out the
best in the players. And, not that we're talking fire and ice here,
but keeping Baylor in the dark about which quarterback the Bears
would face couldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   For Walton this has to be a twisted case of deja vu. As a
redshirt freshman backup in '95, Walton was preparing to start, if
called, in place of James Brown, who had rolled an ankle late in
the previous week's game against TCU. When Brown couldn't drop back
in pregame warmups, it became obvious he would not be sent into the
fray to face Baylor's fierce defense, ranked No. 6 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   That was Walton's job. With less than five minutes left in the
first half, the Longhorns had managed zero net yards in total
offense and no first downs. Then Walton stepped up into the pocket
and threw deep to tight end Pat Fitzgerald for a 70-yard touchdown,
effectively loosening up the Bears' defense for a 21-13 win.
</P>
<P>
   The next week a still hobbling Brown resumed the starting duties
and led the Horns to a 16-8 win at Texas A&AMP;M that won the final
Southwest Conference title. Walton dutifully went back to the
bench, waiting for his time to come. He just didn't expect it to go
so quickly.

 &HT;    Only grumps are unhappy these days
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm so happy I could spit.
</P>
<P>
   And if you believe the recent surveys, this makes me a typical
American.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polls, Americans are optimistic about the
future these days. The pollsters claim we're as happy as we have
been in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gallup, 45 percent of the people surveyed said they
were ``very happy.'' Fifty percent said they were ``fairly happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the other 5 percent are working for Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   I just made that last part up for cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, though, most Americans really are happy now. You want
to know why? There's a simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It's because we aging baby boomers make up 31 percent of the
U.S. population. And as we get older, the nation as a whole is
becoming increasingly more senile.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to cop an attitude when you're wandering around in a
daze.
</P>
<P>
   As a baby boomer, I'll tell you one thing that makes me
optimistic about the future. I'm optimistic about making it to 65
so I can retire and help use up all of the Social Security money,
so these jerks with the nose rings can't get their grubby little
hands on it.
</P>
<P>
   That's one big reason why I'm so doggone cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are several reasons why people around here
should be optimistic. Read 'em and weep:
</P>
<P>
   -When the entire global computer network crashes, as predicted,
in the year 2000, it's going to make it difficult for people to
bill you.
</P>
<P>
   -Never before have people enjoyed so many entertainment
possibilities. Why, there are so many channels on the Time Warner
cable system here in Austin that there's even a new 24-hour cooking
channel called the TV Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that poor people who have television sets but
can't afford filet mignon can at least look at film of other people
enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   -How about this $520 billion federal budget deal passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton? Now there's something to
make you burst into giggles.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget provides money for critical projects. We're
talking $1.1 million for manure handling in Mississippi, $750,000
for grasshopper research in Alaska and more than $5 million to be
divided among eight states to research uses of wood.
</P>
<P>
   This wood thing is important. I'd always heard wood can be used
to build stuff like, say, houses. But this study should confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   -It's easier to get to know people in Austin than ever before.
This is because rents are so high that groups of four or five
professionals have to move in together to make the payments.
</P>
<P>
   -It's another lovely ozone action day, but at least that gives
you an excuse not to mow your yard.
</P>
<P>
   -The general election is on Nov. 3, which means by Nov. 4 we
won't have to look at all of these political ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   -OK, so your investment portfolio is only worth about 80 percent
of what it was a couple of months ago before the stock market
plunged. But look at it this way. Next year you won't have to send
as much money to the IRS _ for manure handling, grasshopper studies
and wood research.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't make you feel better, you're an atypical
grump.

 &HT;    Satanism? Occult? Naaah _ just a bit of Halloween fun
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had to happen one year, I suppose. After years of creative,
even educational Halloween costumes _ a police officer, a knight, a
Civil War soldier _ my son opted for the macabre: a ghoul mask, a
$9.99 Walgreens special.
</P>
<P>
   I stifled the impulse to say, ``What about that darling clown
costume?'' It's a boy thing, I figured. No, it's a kid thing
(little sister Veronica loved it, too). Heck, it's a Halloween
thing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a bad thing, certain church groups would have us
believe. As if parents don't have enough to worry about, we're now
being warned that Halloween could plant the seed for satanic or
occult activities.
</P>
<P>
   Satanism? Paganism? Demonism? Naaah. Alec may be dabbling in
playfulness, in the delight of popping out from behind doorways and
scaring the wits out of his already witless parents, but I'm pretty
sure he's not dabbling in the occult.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year again. Time to shore up reserves of candy
and bemused tolerance for those who insist on seeing evil in
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Bowman of the North Huber Heights Baptist Church
said, ``We just do not see anything Biblical whatsoever about
Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'll grant him that. But isn't there enough bad stuff
going on in the world without picking on Halloween? Are today's
overscheduled kids really in danger of having too much spontaneous
fun? The only evil thing promoted by this time-honored American
tradition is tooth decay. It's a holiday that celebrates families,
neighborhoods and the creative spirit.
</P>
<P>
   On what other day can you overhear your colleagues say, ``I've
got to go home and put on a wart?'' On what other day do dozens (in
our case, hundreds) of neighbor kids knock on your door?
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about being a parent is reliving the
favorite parts of your childhood. I enjoy strategizing my kids'
costumes almost as much as I used to love plotting my own. Once I
spent the entire month of October in the garage, making my costume.
The result was a triumph. Not only that, I may be the only child in
recorded history to go trick-or-treating as the illustrated text of
``Little Women,'' complete with an eyehole-pocked bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   Alec's first Halloween, a friend and I decked out our infants as
Raggedy Ann and Andy. Sooner than I could have dreamed, he had his
own ideas about how he wanted to dress up. Parents are only good
for a little advice: Should he carry his broad ax or his toy
pistol? Should he wear his Civil War costume and be the ghost of a
Gettysburg soldier? His decision may change from week to week, or
hour to hour, but, clearly, he was in charge of his own
transformation on this night of transformations.
</P>
<P>
   So this year he wants to be a ghoul instead of the historical or
literary creature his mother might fancy?
</P>
<P>
   It's a boy thing. No, it's a kid thing. Heck, it's a Halloween
thing.
</P>
<P>
   And _ don't let anyone tell you otherwise _ that's a good thing.

 &HT;    `Mighty' triumphs with imagination, feel-good themes
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wizard of Oz doesn't live in south Cincinnati, as sickly
Kevin Dillon says in ``The Mighty.'' But together, two outcast boys
from the Queen City find a brain, heart and courage.
</P>
<P>
   The second of two films released this fall about a child
afflicted with Morquio Syndrome, ``The Mighty'' is an uplifting
tale of friendship, based on the acclaimed young-adult novel by
Rodman Philbrick. Combining elements of fantasy, adventure, comedy
and tragedy, the heartwarming drama is deeper and more complex than
the similarly themed ``Simon Birch,'' which opened in September.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin (Kieran Culkin) is a young, fearless kid with a huge IQ
and a wild imagination. His debilitating disease leaves him
hunchbacked and in leg braces. Moving to Cincinnati with his single
mom, Gwen (Sharon Stone), Kevin is picked on by bullies at school,
much like his new next-door neighbor, Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson).
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Max is a giant boy in size-14 shoes who lives
with his grandparents, Grim (Harry Dean Stanton) and Gram (Gena
Rowlands), and is tormented for being slow in school and short on
courage.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin perched on Max's shoulders, the pair dub themselves
``Freak the Mighty'' and set out to perform noble deeds, inspired
by tales of King Arthur's knights. But vanquishing bullies is
child's play compared to battling Kevin's disease and Max's father,
Kenny (James Gandolfini), an escaped convict.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Toronto, with three days of exteriors shot in
Cincinnati, ``The Mighty'' features a number of stirring images,
such as knights on horseback crossing the bridge from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's performance is tepid, and the finale is emotionally
overwrought, but the touching film by British director Peter
Chelsom (``Funny Bones'') proves that anyone can triumph over their
own limitations, with the mighty sword of imagination.

 &HT;    `Soldier' predictable with recycled themes
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Russell suits up as a monosyllabic, futuristic fighting
machine in ``Soldier,'' a sci-fi Western from the director of
``Mortal Kombat'' and ``Event Horizon,'' and the screenwriter of
``Blade Runner'' and ``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   The mind-numbing action-adventure flick incorporates elements of
all of those films, but basically plays like The
Terminator-meets-The Road Warrior in space.
</P>
<P>
   The bulked-up Russell is Todd, a galactic soldier whom we learn
in the monotonous prologue was drafted at birth, separated from
society and conditioned to kill with ruthless efficiency. After a
lifetime of slaughter, Todd is rendered obsolete by the next
generation of fighters, typified by the hulking Caine 607 (Jason
Scott Lee), who bests him in hand-to-hand combat. Todd is left for
dead on a remote garbage planet that's believed to be uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
   The laconic hero _ think Clint Eastwood in a Sergio Leone
spaghetti Western _ is rescued by ragtag group of settlers, a la
``The Road Warrior,'' ``Waterworld'' or any other post-apocalyptic
adventure starring Kevin Costner. A compassionate pioneer family
straight out of ``Shane'' nurses Todd back to health, restoring a
modicum of his humanity along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that goes right out the window when Caine and his
crew show up on a training exercise, with orders to exterminate the
settlers. Ol' Todd shows 'em who's obsolete, making his point with
a sharp dagger in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The grotesquely violent testosterone fest from British director
Paul Anderson also features such stomach-turning sights as a
brutally snapped-back forearm and blown-off limbs, along with
relentless explosions and gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has no more than a dozen lines of dialogue in the entire
picture. He mainly stares at the lovely pioneer woman Sandra
(Connie Nielsen), whom Anderson depicts in lingering, soft-focus
close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Want to guess whose husband is conveniently among the first to
die?
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' is completely obvious and totally predictable. The
film's sole saving grace is its stunning production design by David
L. Snyder, the Academy Award-nominated art director for ``Blade
Runner.'' The planetary trash heap features set pieces from
``Executive Decision,'' ``Demolition Man,'' ``Event Horizon'' and
``Blade Runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad screenwriter David Webb People's ideas are all recycled,
as well. ``Soldier'' is utterly disposable.

 By ELIOT A. COHEN  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The shock of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in 1995 overshadowed, in some measure, Israel's celebration of its
50th anniversary three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was not merely the country's leader but one of the pillars
of its survival: a hero in the 1948 War of Independence, the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in the 1967 Six Day War
and the man who as defense minister masterminded the withdrawal
from most of Lebanon after the debacles of 1982-83 and is said to
have ordered his troops to break the bones of the youthful
stone-throwers of the intifada. He was also the Nobel Peace
Prize-winner who presided over the opening to the Palestinians. His
life spanned the full half-century of his country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, was no marginal man, no
fantasist like John Wilkes Booth, no lonely oddball like Lee Harvey
Oswald. He was, rather, the product of some of Israel's finest
institutions: the elite Golani infantry brigade, a prestigious
religious nationalist yeshiva, and arguably the best law school in
the country. He was religious but not a member of the
ultra-Orthodox extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin assassination inflicted a wound on the Israeli polity
that will take decades to heal. It revealed, as in one horrible
flash of lightning, the gap between religious and secular, between
zealots for the land and those willing to sacrifice it, between
those willing to take large risks for peace and those who view such
gambles as trifling with survival.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the murder of Rabin struck a blow at yet another myth
_ that no matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade Israeli
politics, in the end these are merely words, and the nation will
stand together.
</P>
<P>
   That myth, like most myths, rested on a very considerable
element of truth. When a series of suicide bombings this decade in
the hearts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv caused horrible carnage,
secular Israelis glued to their televisions saw squads of bearded
ultra-Orthodox men magically appear to collect, with reverent care,
every dismembered limb, every scrap of human flesh, every drop of
clotting blood for decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   These unpaid volunteers, responding within minutes to pagers
summoning them, were of the same ilk as those who throw rocks at
cars driving on the Sabbath. Indeed, in some cases they were the
same people. For a few moments, these grisly acts of mercy
suspended the ferocity of disagreements about state subventions to
seminaries, draft exemptions and Saturday road closures.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's success in thwarting the very real threat to its
existence in its first decades requires little retelling. In a
series of wars _ some short, some long, some marked by desperate
clashes of tens of thousands of soldiers, some by ambushes and
raids by mere squads _ Israel managed to convince its enemies that
it could not be defeated by conventional means, that prolonged
insurgency or guerrilla struggle would not bring it down and that
even unconventional threats would only elicit cunning and violent
preemption or the most terrible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal assumption of Israeli statecraft _ universal and
implacable hostility on the part of its immediate neighbors _ was
never entirely accurate (Jordan, in particular, often found itself
in clandestine alliance with the Jewish state). But by the 1990s,
it had become completely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   An Israel at formal peace with Jordan and Egypt, in negotiations
with Palestinians who a few years before would never have
considered sitting down with representatives of the Zionist entity,
and with a foreign service stretched to maintain legations in all
the countries eager for ties is not the embattled Israel of old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israel's existence in a state of perpetual siege had
its terrors, but to a large extent it had simplifying comforts as
well. It relieved Israel of the need for a complex statecraft
toward the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The siege helped ensure solidarity within a diverse population,
sympathy from without, and support from Diaspora Jewry. Above all,
it relieved Israel of the need to wrestle with the original and
most durable conflict of all: the contest with the Arabs of
Palestine for a small plot of land to which both peoples had a
powerful claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel may not be at peace,'' remarks Reuven Gal, a sturdy
former paratrooper and onetime chief psychologist of the IDF, ``but
Israelis have decided that they are at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   When they voted in 1996 for the Likud's Netanyahu, they did not,
as some outsiders feared, vote to end the peace process but merely
to slow it down and get a better deal than they expected from
Shimon Peres' dreams of a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself has, without fanfare, given up his party's
ideology, which once stood foursquare against relinquishing
territory to the Palestinians. The prior quarrels within Israel and
between Netanyahu and the Clinton administration have really been
over percentages, pace and details.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud government will probably witness the birth of a
Palestinian state _ and will accept it because most Israelis will
wish it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to forge a new and more subtle statecraft. If
it fights more wars (and it well may, for it still has real
enemies), it must fight them in a political world that has known
formal peace and to which peace may return.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can Israel's internal problems be subordinated to what
Israelis still call ``ha'matzav'' _ ``The Situation'' _ the daily
and enduring security threat. It endures in the form of Hezbollah
ambushes, Hamas bus bombs, Palestinian Authority guerrilla warfare,
or Iranian or Iraqi missiles armed with weapons of mass
destruction. But serious as each of these are, they no longer loom
over Israel in quite the same way security threats did for the last
70 years of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By now, that Israel is the most pro-American country in the
Middle East goes without saying; it has, after all, benefited from
American friendship and largesse and fought its battles using
American weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americanization of Israel goes far deeper. English is so
much Israel's second language that one can live quite comfortably
without knowing a word of Hebrew. American fashions fill the stores

</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful arguments for direct election of the
prime minister (an innovation introduced in 1996) was that it would
give rise to American-style political decorum and stability (which,
of course, it did not). But when Netanyahu gave a gracious victory
speech after ousting Peres in 1996, commentators noted proudly that
he had spoken just the way a successful American pol would have.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Israel's fascination with America mirrors the
general extension of American culture throughout the world. But it
also reflects the natural intertwining of two very different
societies _ one tiny, one vast _ in which Jews can without mental
tricks or self-deception feel comfortably at home.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree unthinkable for Israel's founding generation, their
country has already become dependent on the United States for
matters as diverse and vital as defense and finance. And it
 &UR; has done so, by and large, cheerfully and wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever material successes they have had, Israelis can
never achieve what so many of them crave _ the benign normalcy that
now characterizes Western societies and the United States above
all. Small wonder that hundreds of thousands have emigrated over
the years, most to the United States, which remains a mythic land
of opportunity and forgetfulness to those who find the cramped
confines of Israel and the tormented destiny of the Jews an
intolerable burden.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Israel _ and the catastrophe of the Holocaust, in
a quite different way _ has understandably overshadowed the miracle
of Jewish survival and creativity over the centuries of the Jews'
dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have dismissed or even despised that experience.
Ironically, however, they find themselves increasingly forced to
wrestle with the questions that agitated the Jews in their
wanderings: Who are we, and what is our mission?
</P>
<P>
   More than for any other state, a spiritual question lies at the
heart of Israel's self-definition and, indeed, its very existence.
Few prosperous peoples, in this age of superficial entertainments
and instant gratification, confront such ultimate questions. As one
that does, the Israelis have every reason to be proud.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The shock of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in 1995 overshadowed, in some measure, Israel's celebration of its
50th anniversary three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was not merely the country's leader but one of the pillars
of its survival: a hero in the 1948 War of Independence, the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in the 1967 Six Day War
and the man who as defense minister masterminded the withdrawal
from most of Lebanon after the debacles of 1982-83 and is said to
have ordered his troops to break the bones of the youthful
stone-throwers of the intifada. He was also the Nobel Peace
Prize-winner who presided over the opening to the Palestinians. His
life spanned the full half-century of his country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, was no marginal man, no
fantasist like John Wilkes Booth, no lonely oddball like Lee Harvey
Oswald. He was, rather, the product of some of Israel's finest
institutions: the elite Golani infantry brigade, a prestigious
religious nationalist yeshiva, and arguably the best law school in
the country. He was religious but not a member of the
ultra-Orthodox extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin assassination inflicted a wound on the Israeli polity
that will take decades to heal. It revealed, as in one horrible
flash of lightning, the gap between religious and secular, between
zealots for the land and those willing to sacrifice it, between
those willing to take large risks for peace and those who view such
gambles as trifling with survival.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the murder of Rabin struck a blow at yet another myth
_ that no matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade Israeli
politics, in the end these are merely words, and the nation will
stand together.
</P>
<P>
   That myth, like most myths, rested on a very considerable
element of truth. When a series of suicide bombings this decade in
the hearts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv caused horrible carnage,
secular Israelis glued to their televisions saw squads of bearded
ultra-Orthodox men magically appear to collect, with reverent care,
every dismembered limb, every scrap of human flesh, every drop of
clotting blood for decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   These unpaid volunteers, responding within minutes to pagers
summoning them, were of the same ilk as those who throw rocks at
cars driving on the Sabbath. Indeed, in some cases they were the
same people. For a few moments, these grisly acts of mercy
suspended the ferocity of disagreements about state subventions to
seminaries, draft exemptions and Saturday road closures.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's success in thwarting the very real threat to its
existence in its first decades requires little retelling. In a
series of wars _ some short, some long, some marked by desperate
clashes of tens of thousands of soldiers, some by ambushes and
raids by mere squads _ Israel managed to convince its enemies that
it could not be defeated by conventional means, that prolonged
insurgency or guerrilla struggle would not bring it down and that
even unconventional threats would only elicit cunning and violent
preemption or the most terrible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal assumption of Israeli statecraft _ universal and
implacable hostility on the part of its immediate neighbors _ was
never entirely accurate (Jordan, in particular, often found itself
in clandestine alliance with the Jewish state). But by the 1990s,
it had become completely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   An Israel at formal peace with Jordan and Egypt, in negotiations
with Palestinians who a few years before would never have
considered sitting down with representatives of the Zionist entity,
and with a foreign service stretched to maintain legations in all
the countries eager for ties is not the embattled Israel of old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israel's existence in a state of perpetual siege had
its terrors, but to a large extent it had simplifying comforts as
well. It relieved Israel of the need for a complex statecraft
toward the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The siege helped ensure solidarity within a diverse population,
sympathy from without, and support from Diaspora Jewry. Above all,
it relieved Israel of the need to wrestle with the original and
most durable conflict of all: the contest with the Arabs of
Palestine for a small plot of land to which both peoples had a
powerful claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel may not be at peace,'' remarks Reuven Gal, a sturdy
former paratrooper and onetime chief psychologist of the IDF, ``but
Israelis have decided that they are at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   When they voted in 1996 for the Likud's Netanyahu, they did not,
as some outsiders feared, vote to end the peace process but merely
to slow it down and get a better deal than they expected from
Shimon Peres' dreams of a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself has, without fanfare, given up his party's
ideology, which once stood foursquare against relinquishing
territory to the Palestinians. The prior quarrels within Israel and
between Netanyahu and the Clinton administration have really been
over percentages, pace and details.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud government will probably witness the birth of a
Palestinian state _ and will accept it because most Israelis will
wish it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to forge a new and more subtle statecraft. If
it fights more wars (and it well may, for it still has real
enemies), it must fight them in a political world that has known
formal peace and to which peace may return.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can Israel's internal problems be subordinated to what
Israelis still call ``ha'matzav'' _ ``The Situation'' _ the daily
and enduring security threat. It endures in the form of Hezbollah
ambushes, Hamas bus bombs, Palestinian Authority guerrilla warfare,
or Iranian or Iraqi missiles armed with weapons of mass
destruction. But serious as each of these are, they no longer loom
over Israel in quite the same way security threats did for the last
70 years of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By now, that Israel is the most pro-American country in the
Middle East goes without saying; it has, after all, benefited from
American friendship and largesse and fought its battles using
American weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americanization of Israel goes far deeper. English is so
much Israel's second language that one can live quite comfortably

CLICHES ARE GI-ISSUE   IN FUTURISTIC `SOLDIER'
</HEADLINE>
 OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ Here's the kind of movie ``Soldier'' is: Near the
end, the wordless hero (Kurt Russell) has to save an outer space
settlement by facing down 17 military psychopaths who have been
bred to destroy everything in sight. When someone asks how he plans
to do it, Russell says through gritted teeth, ``I'm going to kill
them all, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the next 30 minutes, he does. Only, Russell doesn't kill
just 17 of these soldiers. As he pops up everywhere (is there more
than one of this guy?), Russell mows down some 30 killing machines,
who just seem to keep multiplying like intergalactic jackrabbits. I
guess the filmmakers figure most of its audience can't count to 17
or would be so deadened by the flying bullets that they wouldn't
even bother to try.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a blatant example of the film's low aspirations.
``Soldier'' is passable entertainment for the blood-and-guts crowd,
but with a little effort, it could have been a pretty good movie.
Instead, the rather pedestrian effects and sets seem like they were
slapped together after watching a ``Mad Max'' movie marathon.
There's little here that we haven't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Russell plays Todd, a veteran soldier who was raised from birth
with one overriding dictum: kill or be killed. But now, in the year
2034, Todd seems to have outlived his usefulness. There's a new
breed of soldiers, genetically improved to be faster, stronger and
just plain meaner. Todd literally is put on the scrap heap, winding
up half-dead on a planet that seems to serve the universe as a
giant garbage dump.
</P>
<P>
   There Todd mends with the help of a scraggly band of humans,
whose presence there is never fully explained. Todd gets back to
speed and gets in touch with his bottled-up emotions just in time
to help stave off an invasion by those new, emotionally repressed
soldiers. The outcome is as predictable as it is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest surprise about ``Soldier'' is just how
little David Webb Peoples' script explores the story's ideas.
Peoples, whose credits include ``Blade Runner'' and ``Unforgiven,''
never defines the future in any kind of interesting way. The
universe seems to be run by some cartoon fascists and no attempt is
made to explain the technological leaps that would put people into
space and populating intergalactic settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The film's inevitable confrontation between the two generations
of soldiers is also standard-issue. Instead of delving into these
warriors' psychological scars, ``Soldier'' merely winds them up in
a routine death match, fought (naturally) in a nicely lit, outer
space rain storm.
</P>
<P>
   The ending reinforces the idea that old soldiers never die.
Neither do old, cliched ideas, which is one reason we'll always
have so many empty-headed movies.

 UNDATED: Buccaneers, 16-10.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (2-5) vs. Tennessee (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bears (42) _ Rushing first downs. Oilers (4-0) _ Vs.
NFC in `97.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Both teams enter on high notes. The Bears upset Dallas
at home by 13-12 and Tennessee smashed Cincinnati by 44-14. The
Oilers' offense finally began to click and show in results what
appears to be so much promise. With Steve McNair at quarterback and
Eddie George in the backfield along with Yancey Thigpen at
receiver, no defense should shut down the Oilers. That is simply
too much talent not to move the football. And now the Oilers are
doing it. George has three 100-yard rushing efforts in his last
four games. Tennessee is 11-4 when George rushes for 100 yards. He
will get that against the Bears and the Oilers prime themselves for
a strong sprint in the season's second half.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 23-9.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (2-4) vs. Oakland (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bengals (2) _ Turnovers committed. Raiders (45.4) _
Donald Hollas' qb rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bengals are a strange franchise and they are having
a strange season. They have committed an NFL-low 2 turnovers this
season. They are plus 5 in turnover differential. Winning the
turnover battle is supposed to mean victories. It is not that way
for the Bengals. Too much shoddy play in other areas. Not enough
big plays in big time. The Raiders are continuing to improve. Their
defense is making wonderful strides. It allowed 381.3 yards per
game in its first six games a year ago. The Raiders have shaved
that to 262.8 yards per game through six this season. That is a
huge jump. Look for Oakland to keep trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-11.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-3) vs. San Diego (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Seahawks (13.2) _ Average. points. allowed. Chargers
(72.0) _ Average. rushing yards. allowed.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: _ Seattle had a bye week to contemplate its furious
start and then dismal skid. The thinking time was much needed. This
is a group of players whose attention span has long been
questioned. Talented, no question, but committed, focused,
prepared? It's been hit or miss with this bunch. June Jones is the
Chargers' new coach and as a result we should continue to see a
more relaxed and improving Ryan Leaf at quarterback. But for Leaf,
this game will provide more growing pains. The Seahawks will be
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (3-3) vs. Carolina (0-6)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bills (10-5) _ Flutie's record as starter. Panthers
(11) _ Kevin Greene sacks.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Buffalo has won three straight and now looks like a
contender in the AFC East. This is a small miracle. There were so
many changes in Buffalo during the offseason _ coach, quarterback,
running back _ that the Bills looked as if they would need a year
just to settle down before being able to truly compete. But fresh
from beating previously unbeaten Jacksonville and from quarterback
Doug Flutie's heroics, Buffalo knows that it is quite capable of
beating most AFC teams. We can't say that about Carolina. What can
be said about the Panthers? High hopes mangled. A quarterback
(Kerry Collins) who was the franchise who is now no longer in town.
A winless team. It remains that way.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (4-2) vs. Kansas City (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Steelers (14.5) _ Average. points. allowed. Chiefs
(7-2) _ Record after byes.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Chiefs have not played since being punished by
40-10 at New England. That will be two weeks and one day by the
time game time rolls around. The Chiefs will be flying around at
home, spurred by the bright lights of Monday night and by the
raucous Chiefs' home crowd. Pittsburgh usually has an answer. The
Steelers are 10-3 under coach Bill Cowher on Monday nights and
often respond when pushed by pushing back. Problem is the Steelers'
offense remains too green to properly answer. This offense simply
has not meshed but should in the weeks to come. Not against the
Chiefs defense, however, which has allowed an average of 10.1
points per game at Arrowhead Stadium in its last 11 games there,
all victories. Chiefs, 23-13.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As hard as it was to get Israelis and Palestinians
to agree in this week's American-hosted summit meeting, the future
of the Middle East peace process looks even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The Oslo peace accords signed five years ago were not
a finished product. They simply set a schedule for settling the
disputes between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are now more than a year behind that schedule.
</P>
<P>
   This week's agreement at the secluded Wye River Plantation in
Maryland certainly moved the process forward. Even so, Ron Pundik,
one of the Israeli authors of the Oslo Accords, warned, ``The
post-Wye Plantation era could be tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, the Palestinians are supposed to recognize Israel's
right to exist. Israel is supposed to make phased troop withdrawals
from some of the Palestinian lands it captured in wars. The idea is
to build trust, allowing the adversaries to resolve the most
important and contentious issues in the so-called ``permanent
status talks'' at the end of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent status issues include whether the 3.4 million
Palestinian refugees, and descendants of refugees, can return to
land that is now part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the holy city of Jerusalem, including whether Israel
will let Palestinians rule part of it, must be decided. And
negotiators must decide whether to dismantle or protect the 144
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the final boundaries of Israel to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has already withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip and
from lots of little pockets in the West Bank. The Palestinians have
made partial progress in dropping their resistance to Israel's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leader
Benjamin Netanyahu journeyed to the woods of Maryland's Eastern
Shore to work out this week's deal, they were already 19 months
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The main topic of the summit: a land transfer that was supposed
to start in March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, the whole process is set to expire May 4, 1999 -- and
the two sides have not even started negotiating the final issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed to declare Palestinian statehood in May. That
would put nations around the world on the spot as they decide
whether to recognize the new nation. And Israeli leaders hint they
could respond by retaking the land they gave back under Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger is that the Wye agreement could unravel before
negotiators can even get to the final issues. Terrorist blasts
could derail it all. So could threats from Netanyahu's right wing
supporters to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take into account the extremes on both sides,''
said Palestinian political analyst Mahdi Abdul Hadi. ``It is a test
all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Wye agreement holds, the two sides are approaching
negotiations over the permanent issues with totally incompatible
positions. Netanyahu says he will never share even an inch of
Jerusalem. About a third of the city's population is Palestinian,
but it is ruled by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis say they will not allow the return of the more than
three million Arab refugees, something that would change the very
nature of the Jewish state. And settlers threaten political
upheaval in Israel -- and even civil war -- if many of Israel's 144
West Bank Jewish neighborhoods are dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arafat says there can be no real peace without a
Palestinian capital in a shared Jerusalem. The refugees insist on
returning to the land they say was stolen from them. The
settlements are indeed situated in occupied territory, and are
often surrounded by bitter Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hadi, the Palestinian political analyst, said
negotiators might be able achieve a permanent status agreement that
will be based on support from both sides and security commitments
from around the region. That, Hadi said, is one of the reasons
Jordan's King Hussein, an influential figure in the region, was
brought into the Wye talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is pending,'' Hadi said. ``Once there is a regional
package for cooperation, I can see the Israelis and the
Palestinians meeting halfway.''

 &HT;    THE ROAD TO WYE, THE LONG ROAD AHEAD
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1023.

<P>
   The summit talks at the Wye River Plantation are one step in
restarting a peace process that was born in hope in 1993 but has
been mired in violence and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 13, 1993: Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin come to the
White House to sign the Oslo accords (negotiated in Norway).
</P>
<P>
   The accords lay out a largely unspecified schedule for Israel to
turn over occupied areas to the Palestinians in return for the
Palestinians dropping their resistance to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   May 4, 1994: Israeli and Palestinian leaders, in Cairo, sign the
Gaza-Jericho agreement, clearing the way for those areas to be the
first areas where Israeli troops withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 26, 1994: Culminating years of secret relations and months
of formal talks, in part a result of the Oslo process, Israel and
Jordan sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 28, 1995: Arafat and Rabin come to Washington to sign the
detailed agreement filling in many of the gaps in the first
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 4, 1995: An extreme right-wing Israeli kills Rabin at a
peace rally in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 20, 1996: As laid out in the previous accords, elections
are held in the Palestinian areas, electing a legislature and
Arafat as president of the new Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   February and March, 1996: Four Palestinian terrorist attacks
kill 54 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   May 29, 1996: Shocked by terrorism, Israelis narrowly elect
right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister over incumbent Shimon
Peres. He had opposed Oslo, but says he will fulfill its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   September, 1996: Scores of Palestinians and several Israelis die
when Palestinian police and Israeli troops engage in firefights.
Palestinians were protesting Netanyahu's expansion of a tunnel near
a Muslim holy site.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 17, 1997: Israel and the Palestinians sign the Hebron
Accords, pulling Israeli troops out of 80 percent of the holy city
and laying out a rough schedule for further withdrawals. Israel has
now pulled out of most of Gaza and pockets in the West Bank
containing most of the Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   March, 1997: Deadline for the first of the three next troop
withdrawals is missed when Israel's offer is rejected as too small.
</P>
<P>
   July-September, 1997: Efforts to restart the peace talks are
derailed when Palestinian suicide bombers kill 24 Israelis in two
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 10, 1997: U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visits the region and leaves with little progress, stressing that
the local leaders are not ready to make hard choices needed for
peace and that she will not come back again to ``tread water.''
</P>
<P>
   September, 1998: Deadline for second in series of Israeli troop
withdrawals missed.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 15, 1998: President Bill Clinton hosts summit at Wye River
Plantation, aiming to get Israel to carry out the delayed troop
withdrawals and get the Palestinians to improve their fight on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In the future:
</P>
<P>
   Early 1999: Negotiations could begin on the toughest issues
under Oslo:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Whether Israel will share Jerusalem;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  whether Palestinian refugees can return to their homeland or
be compensated;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  whether the Palestinians can have a state;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and what the two final borders will be.
</P>
<P>
   May 4, 1998: Oslo accords expire. Arafat says he might declare
statehood whether or not he has Israeli approval. Israel hints that
could prompt it to retake land.

 &HT;    WHERE WYE MEETS OSLO: THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MID-STREAM
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-1023.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: How do the talks at Wye River Plantation Conference
Center fit into the Oslo peace process?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The Oslo Accords, agreed to in 1993, set out a series of
negotiations aimed at settling the dispute between the Israelis and
Palestinians. The understanding was based in part on Israel making
phased troop withdrawals from captured Palestinian lands in
exchange for the Palestinians dropping their resistance to the
existence of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The process was supposed to include a series of troop
withdrawals while leaving the toughest issues to be dealt with at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are meant to end a 19-month stall in the process
and continue the troop withdrawals and security work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far along is the process?
</P>
<P>
   A: Israel has withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip and the
parts of the West Bank areas that are populated by Palestinians.
But, in the West Bank, the Palestinians are left in more than 150
little pockets that are surrounded, and can be cut off, by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Palestinians, having dropped their Intifada
uprising, made commitments to recognize Israel. Their security
forces often work with Israeli forces, but their fight against
terrorist extremists within their own ranks has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the process on schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The troop withdrawal negotiators are discussing at Wye
was supposed to have started in March 1997. And Israelis contend
the Palestinians have not kept their promises to fight terrorism.
The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) started, but never
completed, the process of amending its charter to drop resistance
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are the negotiations so tough?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right now, leaders on both sides have incentives to resist
compromise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is backed by
a right-wing coalition that largely opposed the Oslo process when
it was signed by then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian
statehood on May 4, 1999, when Oslo expires, and he may feel that
deadline will scare Israelis into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If they get an agreement at Wye, what comes next?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, it will have to be implemented. If Israeli troops are
to be pulled out, the withdrawal could be phased over time along
with Palestinian anti-terrorism steps. Then, another phased
withdrawal might be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most important, come the permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the issues in the permanent status talks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Will part of Jerusalem, a city run by Israel with about
450,000 Jews and almost 200,000 Arabs, be ceded by Israel for use
as a Palestinian capital? Will the 3.4 million Palestinian
refugees, and the descendants of refugees, be allowed to return to
Israel? Will Jewish settlements in occupied territories be
preserved? What are Israel's, and the Palestinians', final borders?
</P>
<P>
   And the parties will have to negotiate what kind of powers the
Palestinian government will have, such as whether it will be
empowered to form an army, or negotiate with other countries. And
they will have to resolve whether Palestine will, in fact, be a new
nation.

exchange for the Palestinians dropping their resistance to the
existence of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The process was supposed to include a series of troop
withdrawals while leaving the toughest issues to be dealt with at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye talks are meant to end a 19-month stall in the process
and continue the troop withdrawals and security work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far along is the process?
</P>
<P>
   A: Israel has withdrawn from most of the Gaza Strip and the
parts of the West Bank areas that are populated by Palestinians.
But, in the West Bank, the Palestinians are left in more than 150
little pockets that are surrounded, and can be cut off, by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Palestinians, having dropped their Intifada
uprising, made commitments to recognize Israel. Their security
forces often work with Israeli forces, but their fight against
terrorist extremists within their own ranks has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the process on schedule?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The troop withdrawal negotiators are discussing at Wye
was supposed to have started in March 1997. And Israelis contend
the Palestinians have not kept their promises to fight terrorism.
The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) started, but never
completed, the process of amending its charter to drop resistance
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are the negotiations so tough?
</P>
<P>
   A. Right now, leaders on both sides have incentives to resist
compromise. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is backed by
a right-wing coalition that largely opposed the Oslo process when
it was signed by then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian
statehood on May 4, 1999, when Oslo expires, and he may feel that
deadline will scare Israelis into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If they get an agreement at Wye, what comes next?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, it will have to be implemented. If Israeli troops are
to be pulled out, the withdrawal could be phased over time along
with Palestinian anti-terrorism steps. Then, another phased
withdrawal might be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most important, come the permanent status talks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the issues in the permanent status talks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Will part of Jerusalem, a city run by Israel with about
450,000 Jews and almost 200,000 Arabs, be ceded by Israel for use
as a Palestinian capital? Will the 3.4 million Palestinian
refugees, and the descendants of refugees, be allowed to return to
Israel? Will Jewish settlements in occupied territories be
preserved? What are Israel's, and the Palestinians', final borders?
</P>
<P>
   And the parties will have to negotiate what kind of powers the
Palestinian government will have, such as whether it will be
empowered to form an army, or negotiate with other countries. And
they will have to resolve whether Palestine will, in fact, be a new
nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUJITUMO, China _ In one of the coldest reaches of China,
twenty-three-year-old mother Bai Ming Xia has been assigned to live
with her new baby through this winter inside a sandbagged shelter
dug into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial flood-fighting officials in China's northernmost
Heilongjiang Province have decided that the best way to house Mrs.
Bai and 75,000 other victims of this summer's flood is in temporary
camps consisting of brick-lined ``dugouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Each dugout has sandbagged walls that rise a few feet above
ground level and are topped with a roof made of straw and plastic
sheeting. The only heating comes from a single brick hearth that
doubles as a cook stove.
</P>
<P>
   By January, the temperature on the windswept hillside where Mrs.
Bai's dugout sits is expected to slip to 22 below zero. And even
the government worries about finding enough fuel for the dugout
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our duty is to ensure that no victim of the flood will starve
or freeze to death,'' Ma Shu Jie, the provincial deputy governor,
said in an interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   To Western ears, Ma's pledge may sound minimal. But
accomplishing even that much will be no small feat here in this
hardscrabble frontier region that is worlds apart from the glitz
and bustle of modern China's cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now working out plans to bring 100,000 cubic meters of
firewood from north of the province,'' Ma explained. ``But we don't
have enough money to pay for it.'' She would also like to transport
coal from province mines to the dugouts, but so far there are not
enough funds for that either.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the destruction of about 300,000 mud- and clay-walled
homes, Ma said, the peasants of Heilongjiang Province lost 186,000
head of livestock as well as crops and grasslands to the floods
that swelled over the banks of three major rivers -- the Heilong,
Songhua and Nen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Heilonjiang authorities say that not a single human life was
lost in the province of 36 million because of their insistent,
sometimes forcible, efforts to relocate local farmers in advance of
the cresting waters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most dugout dwellers have accepted the government's
determination about their future with the kind of resigned stoicism
that has characterized China's farmers, now 900 million strong, for
most of the last 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bai, however, is an exception. She is hoping to go her own
way with her two-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby can't live in such cold in the winter. It's dark and
wet here,'' said Mrs. Bai, a round-cheeked young woman. ``I'll go
to my relatives' home. There isn't much room, but it will be better
than here.'' Her husband and his parents will weather the winter in
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Across China, more than 5.8 million families lost their homes in
August and September floods that killed more than 3,600 people and
caused losses estimated at $30 billion. But outside this northern
province, the hardest-hit areas were in the warmer climes of
central and south-central China, where victims can expect a less
punishing winter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Siberia of China, a province just south of the
Russian border whose broad farm and grass lands normally surrender
growth to snowfall by the close of October.
</P>
<P>
   It is a region of jolting contrasts, where wealth from the
Daqing oil fields allows even small cities luxurious indoor
swimming arcades and multi-storied department stores, while
hundreds of thousands of poor farmers live in mud houses without
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles from Mrs. Bai's dugout, some recent visitors were
led to a nearly completed village of 112 solidly built brick duplex
houses. Local leaders said the houses will be assigned to flood
refugees, but probably not until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jiao Ming Zhe, head of the Hujitumo town propaganda committee,
said construction crews had not had time to put in the ceilings
meant to go under the roofs. What's more, the planned hook-ups for
water, electricity and cable television have yet to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, Deputy Gov. Ma said the roughly 75,000 dugout
dwellers scattered in camps throughout western Heilongjiang do not
have first priority in obtaining the new brick duplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims in the dugouts are considered to be living in very
good shelters. The new houses should be used for people living in
other people's homes,'' she said, referring to the more than 1.4
million other homeless flood victims in this province, who are now
doubling up in mud farmhouses or tiny city apartments of friends
and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy governor said the Heilongjiang government has no
thought of moving the rural dugout dwellers into the hundreds of
vacant apartments in modern high-rise cities like Harbin, the
provincial capital of five million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims are farmers,'' Ma explained. ``They have to be
near their land to prepare for farming next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the shelters, which measure about 9-by-18
feet, is a plastic-covered brick platform used as a bed. One end
contains a wood-burning oven that not only provides for cooking,
but heats the platform bed and radiates some warmth into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Firewood is the biggest worry of the ``dugout'' refugees. They
know that is what will keep them from freezing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what we need most is wood to make fires, because the trees
and the grass are all wet,'' said Chen Ling Ji, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is from Jubaoshen, the same village as Bai, and like the
younger woman she was unemotional in telling how her family fled
and lost their home, then had to split up under the pressures of
refugee life.
</P>
<P>
   But finally Chen, too, reached the point when her personal
floodgate ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly weeping, she broke down and tightly gripped the hand of
a visiting journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very lucky to meet you,'' she said through tears. ``It's
the first time I have seen an American. It is very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath Chen's courage was a vein of fear and a sense that
she and tens of thousands of other Chinese need a goodly dose of
luck on top of government promises that they will make it through
the winter.

A BITTER PILL: STAND PAT ON SLUMPING PLAY ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - There's nothing worse than a good player gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Oakland wide receiver Tim Brown. Last year, he
led the AFC in receiving with 1,408 yards. Through six games this
year, he's amassed a whopping 317 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of behavior I'd expect from a high school
letterman.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't make Brown a bad person. Let's face it, the Raiders
have a real quarterback problem _ they don't have a real
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reasons, Brown's collapse makes for some tough
decisions for fantasy owners. How long do you stick with a star in
a slump?
</P>
<P>
   There's always some lesser-known player on your roster who just
might be the answer that week. But you know the minute you start
the other guy, Brown will ring up 472 yards, score six touchdowns
and cement lasting peace in the Middle East _ all in one game.
</P>
<P>
   There's just nothing worse than benching your money player when
he has a big game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the classic case was Dallas running back Emmitt
Smith, who always looked as if he were about to turn the corner.
Trouble is, before he got to the corner, he fell off the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Emmitt is productive enough to start every week, but
other players are causing owners' hair to fall out in clumps.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as with every other problem in the NFL, this is the
fault of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Kordell Stewart has been a mega-bust, throwing for only 847
yards and three touchdowns in six games. He's also rushed for 185
yards and one score _ little solace to owners who took him fourth
in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only quarterback in the AFC worse than Stewart is
San Diego's Ryan Leaf, who actually had a pass batted down by harsh
language.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Stewart's receivers can be covered by motivated
sheep. Despite tossing a 55-yard bomb to Charles Johnson last week,
Stewart often has nowhere to throw. At this point, it might be
impossible for him to pull out of his nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't change the laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart's not the only guy causing headaches. New York Jets
running back Curtis Martin has only one touchdown, mostly because
coach Bill Parcells doesn't think he's big enough to move the pile
around the goal line. To prove his point, Parcells gave the ball to
Martin Monday night, and he was summarily poleaxed at the one-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Ricky Watters has only 490 yards and one touchdown,
not quite the production of say, Chargers running back Natrone
Means, who has 708 yards and four touchdowns for an otherwise
dismal team.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the strange case of Herman Moore, who leads the
NFC in catches with 39, but only has 390 yards and one touchdown.
Johnnie Morton occasionally has looked better, but his space-cadet
nature makes it easy for him to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? You're not going to like the answer. At this
point, I'd keep running these guys out there, unless your backup is
a proven commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, I can give you a really good deal on Tim Brown. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
I'd bench Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell against the Broncos this
week. Jacksonville has a trio of dinged-up running backs, and the
Broncos are monsters at home. I'd also stay away from any New
Orleans players against the Buccaneers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   Take a hard look at running back John Avery, who keeps taking
away Karim Abdul-Jabbar's playing time in Miami. This would be the
perfect time to deal Emmitt Smith, before he gets another nagging
injury. In Kansas City, Donnell Bennett is suffering from a case of
fumble-itis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
This week, it's Jets tight end Kyle Brady, the refrigerator on
wheels who got loose for two touchdowns Monday night against New
England. This may be the last time you ever see his name in print. &QL;

PINOCHET AND THE MYTHS OF THE FAR LEFT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Chile's former ruler, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is no worse
than other Latin American despots of the past, but legend has
turned him into an arch-villain and murderer almost in the class of
a Hitler or Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   So, the 83-year-old Pinochet is under police guard in a London
hospital, where he recently underwent surgery, waiting to learn
whether he will be extradited to Spain to face murder charges for
the deaths of Spanish citizens, allegedly at the hands of his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens next, one thing is certain: He will never
figure as the hero of a musical drama as Evita Peron has done.
Nonetheless, she along with her husband Juan ran one of the most
oppressive regimes of the century in Argentina 50 years ago,
stripping the country bare for their personal profit and throwing
thousands of dissenters into prison. Argentina is only beginning to
recover from the damage they did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being roundly condemned as the corrupt adventuress
she was, Evita over the years has been turned by leftist academics
and then by Broadway and Hollywood into a kind of saintly protector
of the poor and deprived. It is, of course, a thoroughly bogus
portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuba's Fidel Castro travels the world without fear of
extradition warrants, lecturing all who will listen on the superior
morality of Marxism. Yet Cuban jails have proportionally held far
more political prisoners than those in Chile did under Pinochet.
And no one really knows how many deaths the Castro regime has been
responsible for. Certainly a large number.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet is anathema not because he was a general and a
dictator _ neither has been exactly rare in Latin America _ but
because he thwarted the establishment of a leftist regime in Chile
as the then-President Salvador Allende was in the process of
imposing in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to myth, Allende, although elected by only a third of
the voters, was installing a Soviet-style economy on a country with
a long democratic tradition and one of the highest living standards
in Latin America. International Marxism had chosen Chile as the
next Cuba. If Allende had been successful, the history of the last
quarter of the 20th century would have been decisively changed.
</P>
<P>
   There had never been a military coup in Chile's 150-year
history. Pinochet as commander of the army had never before meddled
in politics. With the country in chaos, he acted swiftly and
brutally. Whether he could have been less brutal and still have
ousted Allende remains an open question to this day.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he set up a regime that lasted 20 years, creating a
modern and highly prosperous economy which became a model for the
so-called emerging nations. Then he restored democratic civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Pinochet was more successful than any rightist
dictator has a right to be in the eyes of the extreme left. That's
the real reason he is so hated to this day.

THE REAL PUTZHEADS AREN'T THE ONES RUNNING FOR OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Politics is now so irrelevant to most people that
fewer than half the eligible adults showed for the last
presidential election. So it was refreshing to see Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., using the techniques of professional wrestling to
whip up public interest in the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the public's appetite for pro wrestling seems
voracious. But when it comes to politics, they're increasingly
anorexic.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, in a meeting with 40 or so influential members of
the New York City Jewish community, D'Amato described his
Democratic opponent in the general election two weeks hence, Rep.
Charles Schumer, as a ``putzhead.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know the literal meaning of the Yiddish word
``putz,'' this story might clarify it for you: A guy was looking
for a little attention, so he went to a circus and rented a camel.
He rode it up and down Main Street. After a few hours, he stopped
at a bar for refreshment. When he came out, the camel was missing.
He called the cops to report it stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The cops asked, ``Was this a male or a female camel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A male,'' the guy responded. ``I know that because, when I
rode the camel up and down the street, people were shouting, `Hey,
look at the putz on that camel.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, Schumer was not thrilled at being referred
to as a putzhead, even in what D'Amato insisted had been a private
meeting. Schumer dared D'Amato to call him that face to face, in
their next televised debate. If D'Amato does that, then we could be
treated to the televised spectacle of a U.S. senator being
body-slammed into ringside seats.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that there are real differences between these two
guys and on real issues. Schumer is for gun control; D'Amato isn't.
Schumer is pro-choice; D'Amato isn't. Schumer has an education
plan; D'Amato pretty much limits his program to bashing teachers.
Schumer is too restrictive on environmental matters; D'Amato isn't
restrictive enough.
</P>
<P>
   The painful reality, though, is that most people don't seem to
care about issues like that. Instead, they leave the issues to be
defined by the extremists on each side, who dominate the tone of
public debate through contributions to this candidate or that one,
who then votes the way the money dictates.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens complain, but they do nothing to change things. When
you can't even get half the people eligible to vote to show up for
an election to choose the guy with his finger on the nuclear
button, drastic measures clearly are called for.
</P>
<P>
   So every election, D'Amato does his best to rouse voters with
totally different sorts of issues. Last time he ran, he howled with
agony when his opponent, New York Attorney General Bob Abrams,
called his a fascist. It was beautiful. His family had fled Italy
to escape the fascists, D'Amato said. This was an anti-Italian
slur.
</P>
<P>
   This year, D'Amato is calling Schumer a putzhead and pointing
out that it's OK because Schumer is calling him a bully and a
sleazy liar. And D'Amato is being defended by Ed Koch, the former
New York City mayor, who casually refers to anybody who disagrees
with him as a ``schmuck.'' And if you don't know what that means,
then just imagine this camel ... well, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, all this is designed to anger people _ to persuade
just a few more of them than usual to get off their lazy,
self-absorbed butts and actually go out to vote on Nov. 3. You
might think this relentless name-calling is childish, in bad taste
and totally demeaning to democracy. But, frankly, you probably
won't vote in two weeks, so guys running for high public office
like this don't really care what you think.
</P>
<P>
   They figure you're just another putzhead.

IMPRESSIVE ROCKEFELLER CENTER SHOWCASES ART FROM LATIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With RIVERA-ART)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Like any new baby, the San Antonio Museum of Art's
Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin American Art is being
greeted with delight and high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The $11 million facility, the museum's largest capital project
since its own birth in a renovated brewery in 1981, opens to the
public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the nation's first center for Latin American art, the
new wing is viewed as a major cultural asset for this city's large
Hispanic community, a boost to its prospects for cultural tourism
and, ultimately, an important destination for scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000-square-foot center (the leading private gift, a $1
million challenge grant, came from the Mabee Foundation of Tulsa,
Okla.) occupies a three-story addition to the existing museum, at
the northern edge of downtown. It brings together Latin American
objects from collections that previously had been scattered
throughout the existing museum _ pre-Columbian antiquities, folk
art, works from the Colonial period and a small but choice group of
modern works from Mexico and South America.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the 10,000 objects will be on exhibit at any
given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a whole collection, it's as good as any you'll find,
because of its comprehensiveness, and because it shows 4,000 years
of art in a contiguous space,'' said Marion Oettinger, the museum's
curator of Latin American art.
</P>
<P>
   Other museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, outshine the San Antonio collection in some fields, such as
pre-Columbian art. But Oettinger notes that the Met has little
modern art from Latin America and no folk art.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller center includes an orientation gallery, with a
bank of computers providing historical background on the
collections, and has a small space for changing exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The center is named for Rockefeller, the former vice president
and New York governor who was an avid collector of Mexican folk
art, from his first trip to Mexico in 1933 until his last in 1978,
shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's daughter, Ann Rockefeller Roberts, donated about
2,500 pieces from the collection to the San Antonio Museum of Art
in 1985. (The remaining 500 pieces went to the Mexican museum in
San Francisco.) That same year, the San Antonio museum also
received Robert K. Winn's important collection of Mexican folk art.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Rockefeller and Winn collections gave the
fledgling museum its first legitimate claim to national prominence.
Established in 1981, the San Antonio Museum of Art was born with no
major strengths, apart from a significant collection of historic
Texas furniture and the world's largest collection of Fiesta
coronation gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller collection put the museum on the map. It also
fit nicely with the museum's existing holdings of Mexican Colonial
art and a treasure waiting in the wings _ Elizabeth Huth Coates
Maddux's collection of pre-Columbian art, which was known to be
destined for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1991 that museum officials seriously
considered building a new wing to bring all these collections
together. The turning point was the success of the museum's
blockbuster exhibit, ``Mexico: Splendors of 30 Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the Rockefeller center) would have happened if
the museum had not hosted `Splendors' in 1991,'' said Eduardo Diaz,
director of the city's Office of Cultural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the museum ... saw the expanse of Mexican art and Latin
American art in general, and what it meant to have an exhibit like
that in a city like this, and when they took note of the sheer
numbers of people _ 275,000 visitors in four months _ I think it
really opened up a lot of eyes at the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the idea for the new wing originated during the
``Splendors'' run, according to Emory Hamilton, chairman of the
museum's building committee. At the time, the art museum and the
older Witte Museum (which features Texas history and anthropology
exhibits) coexisted under the umbrella of the San Antonio Museum
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then the Witte and the art museum split, and all their
capital plans were put on hold,'' Hamilton said. ``So it really
started with a vengeance after the art museum became independent.
Money was raised privately, some before the 1994 bond issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Critical to realizing the project, Hamilton said, were early
private grants ``and support from the Rockefeller family and their
decision to let us use the vice president's name on the building.
They don't do that lightly. They want to make sure you're going to
do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how ``Splendors'' brought ``cultural tourism'' into
the vocabulary of this South Texas city of 1 million people, Diaz
also sees the Rockefeller center as a tourist draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If marketed correctly _ and marketing is a big issue _ it has
tremendous potential to be a major attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Moore, director of the San Antonio Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, said his agency has aggressively showcased the city's
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new Rockefeller wing is an excellent asset for us to
utilize to promote our city's cultural highlights to even greater
awareness,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   What the center might mean to the Hispanic community, however,
is a matter of some uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanic artists, in private conversation, are skeptical or
dismissive of the art museum's commitment to Hispanic art and the
local community. The Rockefeller center, with its focus south of
the border, has not ended the skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some of that disgruntlement, and I've even been a
part of it,'' said Maria Elena Torralva-Alonso, interim director of
the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, which showcases local artists.
``I think part of that is historical. In the past, maybe the museum
did not reach out. But I think it's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller center itself is a palpable sign of the change,
she said. ``This is too much of a major investment and a major
statement to this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said he was wrestling with conflicting perceptions of ``the
relationship of the center to the local Latino community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio,'' he said, ``is obviously an important city
because of its visual arts production, from mostly Mexican-American
artists. And yet I don't know what place that movement has within
the (center's) overall context _ and then, I'm not sure it should.
You see, I'm wrestling with it, and I think the community is, too.
It's going to be interesting to see how this juxtaposition works
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in mutually supportive relationships between
the Rockefeller center and other institutions, such as the
Guadalupe and a proposed new museum, allied with the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., that would focus on
Mexican-American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great if there were a place that explored
the cultural resources south of the border and a place that
explored the cultural negotiation that happened north of the
border,'' said Henry Munoz, who is leading parallel efforts to
create the Smithsonian outpost and to revive San Antonio's Alameda
Theater as a Hispanic performing arts venue.

MEXICAN ARTIST'S MISSING WORK TO BE PART OF MUSEUM OPENING

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Missing for most of this century, ``El Albanil,''
the 1904 work of the precocious young Mexican artist Diego Rivera,
recently was discovered in San Antonio and will be displayed for
the first time in the new Latin American gallery of the San Antonio
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of a bricklayer is one of many treasures going on
display Saturday when the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin
American Art opens at the San Antonio Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   During a media preview Thursday, the exhibition crew scurried to
finish installing labels and lighting in time for the
invitation-only, black-tie opening reception Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The $11 million, 30,000-square-foot wing features galleries for
pre-Columbian era, folk, Spanish-colonial and 20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American art curator Marion Oettinger Jr. explained that
the Rivera painting has belonged to a prominent San Antonio family
for more than 70 years. The painting is being loaned anonymously to
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Oettinger said the painting ``was in terrible shape'' and had
been hanging behind a bedroom door because the family didn't know
whether it was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Art authorities who examined it are convinced it is ``the `lost'
Rivera painting,'' Oettinger said, adding that it has been
``beautifully restored'' and is being presented for the first time
in a museum setting. The 18-year-old Rivera painted ``The Mason''
while he was a student at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Rivera submitted this painting as part of a
scholarship competition, which he won, enabling him to travel and
study in Europe,'' Oettinger said. ``The only reason that scholars
know about it is that there is a brochure with a black-and-white
photograph of Rivera working on this painting. It shows the
precocious talent of the young Rivera, and it has to be considered
extremely rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who lived from 1886 to 1957, ranks as one of Mexico's
greatest artists and is renowned for his murals with social themes.

THAT `SICK DAY' TO CARE FOR KID COSTS EMPLOYER, CAN BE AVOIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dilemma is familiar to all working parents: What do you do
when your child gets sick or there is some other last-minute crisis
at home?
</P>
<P>
   Many parents resort to calling in sick themselves in order to
stay home and care for a kid in need. Unless their workplaces have
policies allowing for such absences, most try to disguise what
they're doing and wind up feeling guilty in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts between responsibilities at home and at work continue
to present problems for employees and employers alike.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by CCH Inc., an Illinois-based firm that
specializes in human resources and employment law information,
shows that the incidence of unscheduled ``sick days'' has reached
its highest level in seven years, and the most commonly cited real
reason for missing work is ``family issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Unscheduled absenteeism costs companies millions of dollars in
lost productivity and other expenses, said Paul Gibson, an attorney
and human resources analyst for CCH's Health and Human Resources
Group, which published the study data. If companies were to find a
way to reduce absences, they could cut their costs substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional sick-leave plans do not address the real issues
that are driving employee absenteeism,'' Gibson said in a statement
accompanying the data. ``Companies need to examine more closely why
their employees take unscheduled absences and then develop time-off
programs that truly fit with today's work-life environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The group surveyed about 400 human resources executives
representing about 800,000 employees across a variety of
industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, unscheduled absenteeism increased by 25
percent over the previous year, and the dollars lost to absenteeism
increased 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The highest increases were in companies with between 100 and
1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the average cost of unscheduled absenteeism was $572
per employee. In 1998, it had jumped to $757 per person, the
highest average cost since 1991, when unexpected absences were
costing employers an average of $859 per employee.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs add up. For a company with between 5,000 and 10,000
employees, the average annual cost of employees calling in sick was
about $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies can't ignore the fact that this is happening,'' said
Nancy Kaylor , a researcher with CCH Inc. ``It's too big to ignore
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Family issues were cited as the reason for 26 percent of
unscheduled absences, and those employees who admitted to taking
sick days because of an ``entitlement mentality'' or ``stress''
accounted for about 32 percent of absences.
</P>
<P>
   Stress absences nearly tripled compared with their 1995 levels,
when they accounted for only 6 percent of absences.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like they are just working, working, working, and
they never seem to get the job done,'' she said. Feeling
overwhelmed at work is a prime cause of stress, burnout and calling
in sick.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of unplanned absences caused by stress or other
emergencies is not just the direct salary or wages paid to the
employee who isn't at work. There are other indirect costs as well.
Supervisors spend time juggling work schedules around, and
companies often wind up paying overtime to other employees, or end
up having to hire and train a temporary employee to cover for the
absent worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hidden costs can add another 15 to 25 percent to the
direct cost of unscheduled absenteeism,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The general increase in people not coming to work is a
reflection of outmoded sick leave policies, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that made allowances for paid personal time off
without restricting it to illness actually reduced the incidence of
last-minute no-shows by employees, Kaylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Although such policies are not common, they are beginning to
gain ground as companies recognize the true cost of absenteeism,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are looking at other solutions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting workers in telecommuting arrangements, or allowing
flexible hours to get the job done are two ways to help workers
cope with unpredictable situations at home.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of companies are helping workers find
emergency daycare for children or elderly parents when a worker's
regular arrangement falls through, Kaylor
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the employer working with you to help you, the
employee, get your job done,'' she said. ``They can't afford not to
when the labor market is as tight as it is.''

FACES FROM THE PAST LAUNCH A NEW INTEREST IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Television, still a nascent medium of wonder,
brought wall-to-wall coverage of astronaut John Glenn's first
historic flight. After years of ambivalence by the medium,
television will again focus on the space program, and Glenn's
second historic ascent into space.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 36 years later, Glenn, 77, is going back into space as the
``newest and oldest'' NASA astronaut. On Thursday at 1 p.m. EST,
the man who piloted Friendship 7 is scheduled to be aboard the
Space Shuttle Discovery for its lift-off on a nine-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   Retired CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, himself no kid at 81,
will co-anchor CNN's coverage of the mission from Houston, while
networks will assuredly cover the launch and landing. The launch
also will be the first broadcast of high-definition television, a
new technology that provides more vivid, almost 3-D-like images as
it is phased in over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In an era where NASA shuttle launches are greeted, if at all,
with the apathy reserved for the routine, it takes effort to truly
appreciate the early space program of the late 1950s and early
1960s. The United States was losing the space race and thus the
Cold War, and many felt the very essence of democracy hung in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Glenn. He was already a national hero, an ace
fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, the first man to fly
supersonic from coast to coast _ even a popular contestant on the
hit television show ``Name That Tune.'' If democracy was to be
saved, Glenn was the right man to do it.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, 1962, he saved it. And it took him less than five
hours, becoming the first American to orbit Earth and officially
putting the United States back on equal footing in the race for
space.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Discovery Channel will run a three-hour block
titled ``Return to Orbit,'' featuring three one-hour shows
dedicated to different eras of the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godspeed, John Glenn'' _ the title came from what fellow
astronaut Scott Carpenter said to Glenn during the countdown to
lift-off _ airs at 8 p.m. EST and is narrated by Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   Long fascinated with the space race, Cronkite's metronomic
baritone gives the necessary gravitas to what Glenn and America
faced at the dawn of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of the Cold War, the countdown for Democracy
begins,'' Cronkite intones, as Glenn is shown walking toward the
capsule. ``Astronaut John Glenn is about to be launched into the
icy unknown. At stake is America's space program _ and American
pride. In the race to space, Americans had been consistently
beaten, embarrassed _ humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was such a hero after his successful mission that
President John F. Kennedy grounded him _ America could not afford
to lose such an icon. Glenn went on to a successful career in
politics, representing Ohio in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two other space-related one-hour documentaries will follow:
``The Astronaut'' (9 p.m. EST), chronicling Andrew Thomas'
preparation for his 1998 mission aboard the Russian Space Station
Mir, and ``Inside the Space Shuttle'' (10 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   Post-Apollo space exploration still nabbed the spotlight on
occasion, most notably in 1986 with the Challenger shuttle tragedy.
And movies and entertainment television have continued to use space
as a dramatic vehicle (television's ``From Earth to the Moon'' and
the feature film ``Apollo 13''). But interest remains sporadic at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Now NASA can only hope that bringing back two veterans from when
space was new, scary _ important _ will spark a renewed focus.
</P>
<P>
   And it just might. With the maelstrom of news _ tawdry,
depressing, spirit-sapping news _ coming out of Washington, we
could all use a feel-good story and a respite from cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a low point in the American psyche here that I think
people today tend to overlook and forget,'' Glenn says in the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about 1962, but it could have been today.
Godspeed, John Glenn.

MEXICAN OPPOSITION PARTY TAKES BIG GAMBLE TO WIN SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (EDs: `Today' in 3rdgraf is CQ)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The center-left Democratic Revolution Party has
devised an effective, if opportunistic, solution to weak electoral
slates in Mexico: run stronger candidates from other parties under
its banner.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of ``external candidates'' paid off big in July in
Zacatecas, where the party won its first statehouse on the back of
a politician who until early this year was a distinguished member
of the party's rival, the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democratic Revolution Party, known as the PRD, has
selected so-called external candidates to run for governor of the
northeastern state of Tamaulipas and mayor of the Gulf of Mexico
port city of Tampico in elections today.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not unheard of for politicians to switch parties,
the PRD has made things even easier for its newfound
standard-bearers: It does not even require them to join the party.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor of Zacatecas, Ricardo Monreal Avila, joined the
party only after taking office on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing success of the 10-year-old PRD, a spate of
disgruntled PRI politicians came knocking on the party's door in
the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   While most people expect the bedfellows in politics to be odd,
such tactics are raising eyebrows here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is candidates and parties shopping for
matches,'' said Eric Fernandez, a political analyst at the
Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. ``The first necessity is
that the match not be too smelly.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD found at least one high-profile ex-PRI member that it
could resist in gubernatorial elections in the key state of
Veracruz earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio Morales Lechuga, former attorney general under President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was rejected because of his association
with the former PRI president and persistent rumors of ties to drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Hernandez Estrada, PRD secretary for electoral action,
admits his party's course is perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we are clearly walking a dangerous line between
party principles and political electoral expediency,'' Hernandez
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that such a path seems the only way for a party
like the PRD to carve out space in a political system owned for
nearly 70 years by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   PRD founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, an ex-PRI governor
from Michoacan, bolted the PRI in 1988 to oppose Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say Cardenas, the son of one of Mexico's
legendary PRI presidents, won the election, only to have it stolen
by vote fraud committed by the PRI-controlled electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Once in power, Salinas went after Cardenas and his fledgling
PRD, Hernandez said. PRD candidates were targeted and crushed in
local elections, many activists disappeared or were killed, and the
pro-PRI press hammered the upstart party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salinas saw to it that we were marginalized, that people
thought of us as an infertile option, incapable of winning an
election,'' Hernandez said. ``For our very survival, we decided in
about 1994 that we must start winning some elections to give
ourselves credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategists began developing a policy of alliances with
non-aligned social activists who saw the PRD as the true successor
to the principles of the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And the party signaled its arrival last year when Cardenas
became the first mayor of Mexico City this century to be picked by
popular election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the PRD strategy raises questions about what the electorate
is getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any party using external candidates loses the classic
identification with the party's ideological formation,'' Fernandez
argued. ``Someone who is a strong PRIista jumping to the PRD must
be suspect, because you just don't change overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a non-ideological candidate is a threat to Mexico's
democratic transition, because candidates are decreasingly
associated with known values and are increasingly willing to
negotiate their beliefs for party backing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political system is changing, Hernandez and many
political analysts here say, and so must those who play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican voters are increasingly interested in candidates,
rather than parties,'' Hernandez said. ``It used to be that it
didn't matter who the candidate was, what mattered was that he was
the tapado (the chosen one) by the PRI president or the PRI
governor. Then he became the next president, or governor or
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``we see people increasingly splitting their
votes between parties for different positions. Why? Because they
are evaluating the candidates.''
</P>

   For now, flexibility and a positive spin may be just what the
PRD needs to keep breathing and growing. They were attributes
brightly displayed by Mexican Sen. Amalia Garcia Medina at a
celebration for Monreal's victory at PRD headquarters here in July.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who is the party's secretary of public relations and
alliances, is a former Communist Party member and the daughter of a
past PRI governor of Zacatecas. She is an ideologue and a party
disciplinarian many thought wanted the PRD's candidacy in Monreal's
place.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters from a podium shared with Monreal, who had
yet to join the party, Garcia locked hands with Monreal and
declared in triumph: ``He won, and we won.''

DIRECTOR DRAWS ON HIS EARLY YEARS IN `PLEASANTVILLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Ross, believe it or not, doesn't watch a lot of vintage
television. You'd think he would: As director of filmdom's latest
foray into the land of vertical hold, the new film
``Pleasantville,'' he might be expected to provide sharp, knowing
commentary on the appeal of ``Leave it to Beaver'' or the role the
boob tube has played in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Though he has his favorite shows (``Frasier,'' ``E.R.,''
the usual), Ross isn't really a buff of the old black-and-white
sitcoms, all those ``Father Knows Bests'' that fueled his
childhood. He watched them; he liked them; end of story. What
really intrigues him is the irresistible pull of nostalgia _ and
the clean white gauze that memory casts over a very messy past.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I'm) interested in the way people remember the past and in
using TV as a way of expressing that,'' said Ross, speaking in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``It seemed to me that
nostalgia was being used as a way of simplifying our present by
explaining the past, even if it's a past that never really
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville,'' which Ross also wrote and produced, marks the
screenwriter's feature-film directorial debut. It stars Tobey
Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as in-the-flesh teen-agers who barge
into the placid realm of an old black-and-white TV show, stirring
the pot with their individualism and unpredictability and sex
lives. Mayhem ensues. And as the mayhem progresses, pieces of the
world _ and some of the people in it _ turn to color.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that (H.G.) Wells quote _ `He who controls the present
controls the past; he who controls the past controls the future,'''
said Ross, who spoke in a flood of ideas and literary allusions.
``Nostalgia is kind of a two-edged sword ... What good would a
sunset be if it lasted all day? So you know, it's the impermanence,
or the imperfection of life that makes it great _ even though
that's what scares us.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, he said, a new idea _ writers have been placing their
heroes in alternate universes since the dawn of ink. ``It's `Alice
in Wonderland,' it's `Connecticut Yankee (in King Arthur's Court),'
it's Pirandello's `Six Characters in Search of an Author.' ... It's
`The Phantom Tollbooth,''' said Ross, 42, who talks like a guy who
studied English at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty old premise _ the idea of wanting to satirize
that world. To inject real life into it is a way of satirizing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His own childhood (in Studio City, Calif.) was a compromise
between old and new, traditional and liberal: His mother, a
homemaker, decided when Ross was 12 or 13 to become a speech
pathologist. She went back to school _ ``which was very scary for
her, and very outside the normal roles, which she'd been used to,''
Ross said. ``And as a kid I helped her a lot studying. My dad,
although a very progressive and liberal man, was not that
supportive of how that sort of upended his family _ `Where's my
dinner,' you know. And actually, in a very private _ not secret,
but private _ way, I helped my mother study.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, ``Pleasantville'' contains scenes of
exquisite tenderness between Maguire and Joan Allen, who plays a
stifled sitcom mother who yearns to be free. ``I think a lot of the
relationship that Tobey has with the Joan Allen character, and the
bonding that occurs, was borne of my relationship with my mother,''
Ross said. In fact, his mother died of cancer during filming _ on
the very day when the director shot a touchingly intimate scene
between mother and son. ``I went in and I said to Joan, the first
person I saw, and I said, `Look, my mother just died. I don't know
whether to do this or not, to keep shooting, but this scene is
about her.' And she said, `Well, I think we should shoot that scene
for your mother.' ... It was a wild experience, but a very
appropriate one. It felt like a phenomenal way of honoring my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In movies and in life, Ross doesn't shy from emotion. His
best-known screenplays are ``Dave'' and ``Big'' _ both far-fetched
stories with deeply felt characters. Clearly, he likes big
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I like to root them in character,'' he said. ``I like to
try to make them personal. To me, a big concept is only really
worth it because it heightens emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about television? Does he think it's evil? ``I don't
know that it's evil. I don't think that it's evil. I think people
naturally want to homogenize the world. I think people want to
simplify the world.''

the head Monday at his hog farm outside the little town of

European sparkling-wine industry is pinning its hopes on huge

BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS SEEK CONTROL OVER WORKING LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1988 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An increasing number of people who are older than 40 years of
age are starting their own companies to get more control over their
working lives.
</P>
<P>
   They've been emotionally battered from getting downsized during
the 1990s and when they lose their jobs again in this latest
slowdown, they're not so interested in moving back into the
corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   In its quarterly survey of 3,000 job seekers, 85 percent of
those who opted to start their own company were over 40 years of
age, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the outplacement
firm in Chicago. That's a significant increase from one year ago
when 73 percent of people over 40 years of age were starting their
own business.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees have been caught twice by downsizing since the
early 1990s, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of
the outplacement firm. They see the business climate has changed _
that corporations no longer offer a safe employment haven _ so they
take matters into their own hands and start a business.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is particularly hitting the over-40 crowd because
they've got the financial resources and confidence to go out on
their own, Challenger said. Many have had experience as independent
contractors and realize they can run their own business
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Many also have the luxury of having a spouse with a steady, full
time job which makes it easier for the other spouse to strike out
on his own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Starting a company &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Knapp took the big step when his former employer,
Brown Brothers Harriman, consolidated its Houston office into its
Dallas office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said Brown Brothers, the tony New York investment banking
firm, offered to get him another position at the firm but that
would have meant Knapp would have to move away from Houston. So
Knapp used his severance pay to start Chilton Capital Management,
hired his old Brown Brothers employees and in two years, he and his
business partner, have about $101 million under management.
</P>
<P>
   Like all start-ups, there were initial hassles at first, and
it's hard to get people to trust their money to a new firm without
an operating history, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Knapp, who specializes in dealing with families,
entrepreneurs and individuals with accounts that range in size
between $250,000 and $1 million, said the firm has forged working
relationships with a hedge fund and a capital management firm that
focuses on corporate clients. It's been very satisfying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, people start their own businesses because they don't
feel as if they have any other options, said Tom Duening, professor
of entrepreneurship and assistant dean for the University of
Houston's College of Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Many downsized workers who are over 50 years of age are finding
they can't get another corporate job that pays the same wage as
their previous job in part because they didn't stay current with
technology, said Duening.
</P>
<P>
   And when people go through layoffs for the second time they
start to get stigmatized, said Duening. Potential employers begin
to worry about a worker's value to an organization if they get
continually downsized.
</P>
<P>
   After sending out 1,000 resumes and having two lousy interviews,
many workers then figure they can eek out a living by going into
business for themselves, Duening said. They think: Why not take the
plunge?
</P>
<P>
   But given the choice, lots of entrepreneurs would prefer to go
back to corporate life, Duening said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sometimes downsizing is blessing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lois Crowley, director of the Jobs Program at Northwest
Assistance Ministries in Houston, said she has seen a number of
people who've started their own business assuming it would be
easier than finding another job.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a good idea to them at the time like working out
of their home, said Crowley, who counsels laid off workers. Not
everyone, however, is good at marketing themselves or keeping the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes getting downsized is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Mikulin lost her job at Methodist Hospital five years
ago as director of customer relations in the midst of a company
downsizing. That was just the push she needed to start her own
business, Customer Focused Systems, in which she consults and
trains companies about the importance of good customer relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulin said she loves being in charge of growing her own
business, the increased flexibility she has to juggle family
responsibilities and the higher income.
</P>
<P>
   She said she often gets full-time employment offers from
companies she consults with but Mikulin said she has turned them
all down because she's having too much fun on her own to return to
the corporate lifestyle.

READERS OFFER SUGGESTIONS ON BEVERAGE-DRENCHED KEYBOARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, a reader asked about strategies for getting spilled,
sticky liquids such as soda or coffee out of a keyboard. I offered
a few basic suggestions, but asked readers for more.
</P>
<P>
   And I got more! This topic seemed to strike a nerve _ it seems a
lot of people have had to deal with this problem. Here are some of
their suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is an easy solution for this one, if caught in time. It
builds on the answer you already gave: In the case of sugary soft
drinks being spilled into a keyboard, take the keyboard to the
nearest sink and flush it with running water. Then use a hair dryer
to circulate the cleansing water and dry it. There's a good chance
this will keep the keyboard working, and there's no downside _ it
was going to be trash anyway!
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm no hardware guru, but my friends and I have found that
soaking electronics in rubbing alcohol works. Usually, we get a
shallow pan or dish, disassemble the keyboard and soak the circuit
board in the alcohol. (Some keyboards contain a plastic membrane
instead of a circuit board, but it can go in all the same.) A
friend recently cleaned out a portable CD player (which had been
saturated by root beer) in this way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought: Diet sodas seem to be more on the level with
water than their sweet counterparts _ they don't leave a sticky
residue when they dry. It could be a good reason to switch to diet,
especially around the computer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can buy electronics cleaner at any electronics store _ try
RadioShack _ and that should work. I've also heard that you can use
hair spray, but I'm not about to try that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Mark Minasi's excellent ``PC Upgrade and Maintenance Guide,''
he estimates the time required to disassemble and clean a keyboard
at four hours. Unless your time is worth less than $5 per hour,
it's much cheaper to buy a new one!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is CGI scripting? And why should I need it? I am
sure part of your answer will be: If you do not know what it is,
then you don't need it. You see, I am paying my Internet provider
for something I cannot or do not know how to use.
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right _ if you have to ask, it's not for you. However,
if you're being charged a line item on your bill for it and you
aren't using it, definitely have your provider remove it and refund
your money.
</P>
<P>
   CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface, and it's a kind of
programming language used to provide advanced capabilities on a
World Wide Web site. For example, you can use CGI script to change
images randomly, or collect information via a form. It essentially
serves as a bridge between a Web page and a program that runs on a
provider's server.
</P>
<P>
   If your provider is simply offering free Web page space with
your account, and those pages have CGI capabilities, you're not
paying for something you're not using _ it's part of the package.
But, again, if it's a line item you should probably chat with the
provider's billing department.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your column on 56K modems in the Oct. 16 Technology
section, you wrote that you were getting download speeds of as high
at 37K! How do you do that? I can only get, at most, 3 or 4K.
</P>
<P>
   A. I achieved those using simple math.
</P>
<P>
   I was reporting the download speeds in kilobits, but when your
download software shows you a figure, it's reporting in kilobytes.
Since there are 8 bits to the byte, just multiply the number you
see times 8. I used kilobits in order to be consistent with the
measure used to report connection speeds _ as in 52 kilobits, or
52,000 bits.

WEB AD AVOIDANCE TAKES A NEW TURN 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have a love-hate relationship with advertising. We
like the fact that advertising informs us about new products _ so
long as we have our hype filters in place _ and that it keeps the
cost of media low, in some instances reducing it to zero.
</P>
<P>
   But we also resent its intrusiveness. We are bombarded by
commercial messages _ on the sides of buses, on the handles of
turnstiles, in restrooms, at the movies and on garish signs high
above scenic roadways. There is even a high school that allowed an
ad to be painted on its roof so airline passengers might glance
down and see it.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this yin and yang more apparent than on the World
Wide Web. The Web is an incredible source of free information
precisely because of advertising. Although a Web site that actually
makes a profit from ad revenues is a rare creature, site owners are
betting on the future. They know that, for now at least, Web
surfers aren't likely to pay directly for information, thus making
ads their best source of cash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Net commercial activity once banned &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the Web is mostly supported by ad revenues is ironic,
because the early culture of the Internet was very hostile to
advertising. The Net's roots are in government, academia and the
world of nonprofit groups, and commercial activity was forbidden
until 1990. Early Web advertising was looked upon with scorn by Net
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Ads weren't welcome in the early online services, either.
Remember the original incarnation of Prodigy? It was the first
online service to place graphical ads on every screen, drawing
derision from the digerati. Some Prodigy customers didn't like it
either _ there were stories of people putting black tape on their
monitors over the place where Prodigy's ads popped up so they'd
never have to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Web advertising is rampant. On some sites, you'll find
banner ads at the top of pages, block ads down the side and another
banner at the bottom for good measure. There are even ads found on
some popular personal home pages. If you go to sites such as
GeoCities or Tripod, which host free Web pages for people and
businesses, ads pop up in a separate window as well.
</P>
<P>
   I sense that a backlash has begun against pervasive Web ads.
Several readers have e-mailed me independently to complain. I'm
seeing more and more snide comments about it in discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting sign is the growing number of software
titles, usually available as shareware, that successfully filter
out Web advertising. They have the happy side effect of speeding up
the loading of some pages, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A hit list of annoyances &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been working with a product called InterMute, which
prevents several Internet annoyances. It strips ads from Web pages,
stops animated GIFs, prevents pop-up ad windows and more.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite features is that it stops background music _
a pet peeve of mine. I hate going to a Web site that suddenly
starts playing music and offers no way to shut it off. This is as
irritating as someone jauntily whistling in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   For the security-minded (read: paranoid), InterMute can prevent
the planting of cookies _ small text files _ on your hard drive. I
generally don't advise that you do this, because most cookies are
harmless. They usually are there to give a site operator
information about what pages are most popular, or they keep a user
from having to log into a site with each visit.
</P>
<P>
   InterMute also can prevent referrals, in which two Web sites
share information about how you got from point A to point B. For
example, if I am surfing at Widgets.com and decide I want to click
over to Grommets.org, Grommets can learn from a referral that I was
just at Widgets.
</P>
<P>
   InterMute can make a list, or log, of everything it does. You
can then read the list and see how many ads, animated GIFs,
background tunes or referrals you avoided. You also can turn off
InterMute temporarily without actually shutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   The program is not without its drawbacks. It changes some
browser settings known as proxies. Most people who use the Internet
from home don't have to worry about this, but many people who use
the Web at work from behind a fire wall must have pre-configured
proxy settings. You'll have to manually enter these settings in
InterMute's control panel.
</P>
<P>
   I have found at least one page that I cannot access if I have
InterMute running, and it's a major one _ Netscape Communication's
Netcenter. I must turn off InterMute and undo its proxy setting in
order to get to Netcenter, which is one of the most popular sites
on the Web. I've worked with InterMute's tech support and have yet
to find a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, I've gone to specific Web sites with InterMute
and could not see any links. InterMute misinterpreted them as ads
and hid them from me. Fortunately, you can edit the database of
pages and their configurations that InterMute keeps on your hard
drive. If you let InterMute's tech support know about the page, it
will be added to the database.
</P>
<P>
   But other than this, InterMute works quite well. With banner ads
stripped out, pages do seem to load faster, and I no longer have to
put up with Muzak-style renditions of ``Eleanor Rigby'' when I
visit personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a two-week trial version of InterMute at www.inter- &QL; 
mute.com, and it costs $19.95 to register. It's available for
Windows 95/98/NT and Unix computers. The site says a Macintosh
version is ``temporarily unavailable.'' There's also a pure Java
version, which may or may not work on a Mac.

PARIS DESIGNERS RESPOND TO YEN FOR COOL COMFORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Remember this summer when every woman you knew was
suddenly wearing a long dress? How cool they looked, how comfy,
young and feminine?
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? A few French designers got the message.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that designers Valentino, Christian Lacroix and
Jean-Paul Gaultier have ignored the feminine side of fashion. One
could argue that Valentino and Lacroix are at the pinnacle of such
styles. But their ready-to-wear for spring 1999 showcases a new
woman. She is younger, more casual, more comfort-oriented and
definitely feminine, although not ``girly.''
</P>
<P>
   Think gypsy peasant blouse, and you have the essence of
Valentino's spring look. Sheer, embroidered, lacy, lavish, tied or
untied, dripping off shoulders, tucked or untucked, bloused and
bewitching. He paired them with everything from voluminous full
skirts to cropped pants.
</P>
<P>
   His palette was white and gray, with bits of pastel pink and
blue. There were none of his usual crisp suits on the runway.
Dresses and skirts paired with boxy jackets and a lot less of the
glitz and glitter for which Valentino is known. The new Valentino
woman is dressed down, romantic and sporty.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix took a similar path in his collection. His new ideal
appears to be the young niece (if not the daughter) of the women
who donned his over-the-top ensembles of the '80s. Now she's been
turned loose to play in the sand in beautiful fabrics worn with
sandals or tiny princess-heeled slippers.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes, still ornamented, are nonetheless simpler. A pale
gray, folded bodice takes a silvery metallic lace skirt, its
scallops ending at the knee. Striped satin is made into a dress
with a portrait neckline and a huge skirt, but the black and white
non-color scheme keeps it modern and light.
</P>
<P>
   With Jacquards, moire, lace and organza, Lacroix goes for the
rich hippie image. His ideal young woman seemed to have pulled out
whatever caught her eye in some grown-up's closet and combined the
pieces any old way, tying her wrist with ribbons to trail in the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's big girl fashions were trickier, based on a
multicultural but mostly Asian aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   His models awoke in a museum, perhaps, or so the partially
draped pieces of quasi-Greco Roman sculpture on the runway
suggested. With white plaster drying in their hair and plaster
bustiers incorporated onto fishnet bodices, they worked their way
into a dreamlike presentation with a passionate ending.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate ensemble was of layered kimonos, sheer and opaque,
topped with a laced fuchsia satin corset topped with a couple of
Japanese obi sashes topped with a narrow leather tie belt. No woman
in her right mind would wear all those pieces together, but it made
for an ``Oh, my gosh, look how fabulous!'' moment in fashion
history.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer chiffon kimonos sprouted opaque portrait collars and deep
Battenberg lace edging on the full sleeves. A gray chiffon kimono
topped a very respectable gray pantsuit. One obi was nothing more
than the cut-off top of a pair of jeans, worn over a white kimono,
worn over _ oh, my gosh! _ a full pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   There was a patchwork of denim and other blue fabrics. Jerseys
printed with statuary and graffiti. Tons of elastic-waist pants,
cut very short in the crotch so that they hung low, not coming
anywhere near the waist. And a black tuxedo kimono. Everything was
worn with platform shoes, and even the swimsuits were worn with obi
sashes and those narrow tie belts.
</P>
<P>
   And what will people say when they see sheer kimonos worn over
those ribbed undershirts that kids call ``wife-beaters?''
</P>
<P>
   The show wound on and on, so that one wondered if the evening
would run out of hours before Gaultier ran out of ideas.
Fortunately, it didn't. He closed with an audience hooting and
stomping approval for teensy model Vanesse Mae playing a wild
violin.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my gosh, it was great fun, chock-full of ideas that begged
to be stolen. &QL;

`GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS' HAS THE ANSWERS 
 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a test you can take without worrying about an A or an F.
</P>
<P>
   1. What movie grossed the largest box-office revenues in the
world?
</P>
<P>
   2. What is the world's strangest substance?
</P>
<P>
   3. Who is the world's fastest man? The fastest woman?
</P>
<P>
   4. Who is the most-mentioned woman on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   This is an open-book test, and the answers are in the ``Guinness
1999 Book of Records'' (Guinness Media, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   From the world's smallest ocean (the Artic Ocean) to the person
with the most tattoos (Bernie Moeller of Pennsylvania with 14,006
tattoos), the book contains an extraordinary and entertaining
collection of serious and not-so-serious records. For the 1999
hardback edition, the book features a three-dimensional cover.
Between the covers is some eye-catching color to document the more
than 7,000 records in 210 categories.
</P>
<P>
   OK, back to the test.
</P>
<P>
   The answers are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Guinness lists ``Titanic'' as the world's all-time box office
champ with earnings of $1.7 billion. But ``Titanic,'' which starred
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, was also the most expensive
movie ever made, with costs of nearly $250 million. It also set a
record for the largest movie stunt budget, $3 million, and resulted
in a record 6,000 stunt days worked by 100 stuntmen and women.
</P>
<P>
   2. The world's strangest substance can be found by turning on
your faucet. It's water. Most substances shrink when they are
cooled, but water expands. Water is less dense as a solid than as a
liquid. That explains why the ice cube floats in your glass of
water. Water requires 10 times as much energy to heat as solid
iron, and it can dissolve anything.
</P>
<P>
   3. The world's fastest man lives in Houston. Carl Lewis and Ben
Johnson of Canada reached a peak speed of 26.95 mph in the 1988
Olympic 100 meters final in Seoul, Korea. Johnson won the race but
was disqualified after a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The late Florence Griffith-Joyner reached a speed of 24.58 mph
in the women's 100 meters final, also in the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis holds a record 10 world championship medals, including
eight gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   4. And who is the most-mentioned woman on the Internet? Actress
Pamela Anderson, the former ``Baywatch'' star, is linked to more
than 1.5 million sites and inspires more than 172,000 hits a month
on search engines. The most-mentioned man is President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we so fascinated with records? Psychologist Colleen
Hester of Houston's University of St. Thomas said that records
motivate us. ``Each time someone creates a limit, it sets a goal
for us to exceed,'' Hester said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation recently was fascinated by the baseball home-run race
between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of
the Chicago Cubs, she said. The competition motivated each player
and focused the nation on performance and achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Goals and records can be unhealthy if they become an obsession,
Hester said. And some records are not worth pursuing. Do you really
want 14,007 tattoos?
</P>
<P>
   But many records can never be achieved by anyone. The cheetah
can run up to 60 m.p.h. over 600 yards. Some bats can hear
frequencies as high 120 to 250 kilohertz. The human limit is 20
kHz.
</P>
<P>
   Certain armadillos, oppossums and sloths spend up to 80 percent
of their lives sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Some records we don't want to know about. Blood-sucking
hookworms inhabit about 700 million people worldwide and are
responsible for an estimated daily blood loss of 12.3 million pints
of blood. That's equal to the blood of more than 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Other records are simply out of this world. The largest canyon
system is the Valles Marineris on Mars. It is at least 2,800 miles
long and 370 miles wide with a maximum depth of four miles.
</P>
<P>
   You may have contributed to some records. The horror movie
``Scream'' grossed $107 million, the highest-grossing horror movie
ever. Fans of ``The Simpsons'' have made it the longest-running
prime-time TV animated series. It is in its ninth season.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna has sold 100 million records worldwide, the most
successful female artist ever. Elvis Presley has sold a reported 1
billion records. The most successful group is the Beatles, with
estimated sales of 1 billion records and cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck guessing some records. Who is the most filmed author?
Did you guess Stephen King, who wrote ``The Shining, Carrie and
Misery?'' Wrong. It is William Shakespeare. More than 300 films
based on his plays have been produced, including the recent ``Romeo
and Juliet'' that starred Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cry for King. He is the richest author in the world
with an estimated worth of $84 million.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the best-selling book of all time? The Bible with an
estimated 3.88 billion copies sold between 1815 and 1998. Excluding
noncopyright works like the Bible, what is the best-selling book?
``Guinness Book of Records'' has sold more than 81 million copies
in 37 languages. &QL;

UPCOMING BOOK OFFERS INTRIGUING LOOK AT NEW YORK GOVERNORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ From the reign of Rocky to the power of Pataki,
New Yorkers have housed more than their share of characters and
caricatures in the governor's mansion over the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rockefeller, the benevolent dictator. Malcolm Wilson, the
professional understudy suddenly cast in a starring role. Hugh
Carey, the tragedy-stricken former congressman. Mario Cuomo, the
ponderous pontificator. And George Pataki, the cagey and
occasionally ruthless politician with the deceptive gee-whiz,
aw-shucks presence.
</P>
<P>
   The last five governors, and the murky political waters in which
they swam, are analyzed and humanized in a colorful new Syracuse
University Press book. ``From Rocky to Pataki: Character and
Caricature in New York Politics'' combines the talents of writer
Peter Slocum and the artistry of retired Albany Times Union
cartoonist Hy Rosen to put text and texture to the story of recent
state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen and Slocum _ both longtime observers of the state
political scene _ spent two years researching the Rocky-to-Pataki
era, interviewed 50 players, survivors and victims of New York's
blood sport and learned that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rocky apparently tapped the telephone of a neophyte
assemblyman from the Erie County town of Depew _ who is now state
senior Sen. Dale Volker _ during a raging debate over the
governor's ultra-harsh drug laws.

   _ Carey had to lose a golf game to get critical information out
of the Ford administration, information that ultimately helped
secure federal help when New York City was on the brink of
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cuomo was advised by his son and top adviser, Andrew, not to
seek re-election in 1990. Reason: The state was heading for
economic trouble and Andrew thought his father would take the
blame.

   _ Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro _ not Betsy McCaughey

Castro's husband was opposed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, views Pataki as
virtually invincible in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a book came from a professor at the State
University of New York at Albany, Sarah Blacher Cohen, who
suggested that Rosen publish a collection of his cartoons. Rosen
was intrigued. He had piles of cartoons that had chronicled, with
both insight and humor, the triumphs and transgressions of recent
governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked them all,'' said Rosen, 75, of Glenmont, offering an
artist's perception of the five governors he frequently skewered.
``Rockefeller was a colorful guy, very animated with that mouth of
his. Malcolm Wilson I drew like Alfred E. Neuman _ 'What, Me
Worry?' _ the Mad magazine guy. Carey, I got him dyeing his hair.
Cuomo, he was terrific, with those bags under his eyes. Pataki is
not easy to do. But you can always caricature him as a tall, slim
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, however, thought the book should be mostly text, and
since ``I can't spell,'' the illustrator connected with Slocum.
Slocum, a former newspaper reporter who has worked in state
government _ currently as a top aide to the Democratic Senate
minority leader _ since 1982 and can spell, jumped at the chance to
collaborate on a book. Most striking to Slocum, even though he has
been in and around state government long enough to witness the
change, is the evolution of the Legislature as a co-equal partner _
or frequently, competitor _ of the governor, and the devolution of
civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of the Legislature has grown enormously,'' said
Slocum, 51, of Albany. ``Rockefeller had unique power because of
his financial resources. He really owned the state (Republican)
party.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Rockefeller left Albany and eventually became Gerald
Ford's vice president, lawmakers began grasping for power, and they
haven't let go, Slocum said. Consequently, Pataki has to negotiate
with the Legislature, while Rockefeller essentially told lawmakers
how it was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he was struck by ``how nasty it is now,'' intensely
political and petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose in some ways the stakes are higher,'' Slocum said.
``The new style of campaigning and success of negative campaigning
means we have sort of a year-round negative campaign mode. Both
parties play the game, but the Republicans are better at it right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which sells for $26.95, is scheduled to arrive in
stores Nov. 6.

`SLAM' IS WELL-DONE IMPROVISED NARRATIVE-FICTION FILM 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any critic who'd tell you he walks into a theater without
prejudice would also shake his finger at the TV cameras and say,
``I did not have sex with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how well ``Slam'' is done that it made me
like what I am inclined not like: improvised narrative-fiction
films.
</P>
<P>
   Almost never during this engrossing picture did I feel that the
words actors think up on the spot are inferior to words writers
carefully devise in advance. Nor did I feel that cluttered passion,
which is the implied benefit of improv, was a trade-off for
organization and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   I'm generally exasperated by the imposed, marketing-driven use
of MTV visuals; but these filmmakers demonstrate that they can be
evocative and augmentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam'' refers to ``poetry slams,'' the entertainment in clubs
where poets read their work in a competition setting, with rules of
engagement and winners and losers. The film gets to that topic
later than sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadlocked Ray (Saul Williams) writes in the rhyme scheme of
rap but does not perform to music. He is a poet who supports
himself by dealing dope in the hard ghetto of Washington, D.C. He
is a resident there on the same terms a fallen leaf is a resident
of anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ray visualizes himself as decriminalized because he deals only
in relatively benign marijuana and sells only enough to feed
himself and to buy notebook paper and pens.
</P>
<P>
   In this world, he is unworldly, which is frighteningly clear
when he is arrested and put in the immense D.C. jail. The jail
population is so overwhelmingly black it looks, as one character
puts it, like a slave ship.
</P>
<P>
   Told he must choose one inmate gang or another to survive, he
refuses. When he is surrounded in the exercise yard with a hideous
beating just instants away, Ray begins free-style slamming.
</P>
<P>
   This sequence is the film's litmus test. If you think an
explosion of self-defensive poetry is unlikely to stop these
atavistic hardcases in their tracks, the rest of the film will be
lost to you. I didn't buy it literally. I did buy it as a metaphor
for the power of creativity, which is what this film is about at
the first level beneath its story.
</P>
<P>
   The slamming earns Ray the respect of the inmate-alpha-male
Hopha (Bonz Malone), who pays Ray's bail. Outside, Ray looks up
Lauren (Sonja Sohn), who taught creative writing to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   They are attracted to each other. But Lauren points out that
between them is the matter of Ray's prison sentence (Ray has a
cruel choice between hopeless trial and plea bargain).
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most powerful scene, and one in which
improvisation inarguably enhances the power, Ray says he doesn't
feel guilty. Lauren tells him he must accept responsibility for
what he did. Ray says his responsibility is to his dream; this is
no metaphor, this is his life. Lauren says that Ray's dream is
waiting for him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   So to give him a spot in the future to focus on after
discharging his responsibility, Lauren introduces him to
competitive slams. Ray is an instant winner.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Marc Levin, who comes to
feature-fiction from making documentaries, most visibly prison
documentaries for HBO. The screenplay is credited to him, Malone,
Sohn, producer Richard Stratton and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a poetry-slam champ, makes his film-acting debut,
although he has had extensive training as an actor. He and Sohn
wrote the works they perform in the film.
</P>
<P>
   The prison scenes, shot quickly and much on the run in the D.C.
prison, have a strong sense of reality. Levin knows prisons. He met
Malone in one (and during production Malone went briefly back to
prison on a parole violation).
</P>
<P>
   Levin shot the film more in the documentary style than the
fictional: He uses long, unedited takes and played the focus and
framing glitches as they lay.
</P>
<P>
   The grit feels like real grit, not movie grit, and it's as
abrasive and nagging as grit is intended to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Slam''  &QL; 
Starring: Saul Williams and Sonja Sohn &QL; 
Rating: R for pervasive language, a sex scene and brief violence. &QL;

SWEET AND DARK SWIRLED TOGETHER IN `PLEASANTVILLE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' feels remarkably good _ sweet and dark,
swirled together, a gentle comedy with little flakes of David Lynch
in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a heart and it's got a brain. The filmmakers serve the
content in layers: The more you think about it, the more ideas it
conjures up.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ross wrote the screenplay and makes a smashing debut as a
director. Ross's writing credits include ``Big'' and ``Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the premise, your eyes may roll at how silly it
sounds: By pushing a magic TV remote control, the siblings David
(Tobey McGuire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are sucked into
the TV and deposited in a '50s situation comedy called
``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before he pulls the trigger on his gimmick, Ross bonds
us to David with care and patience.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen David in high school classes, repeatedly told by his
teachers about the economic, social and environmental bleakness
awaiting his generation. ``Who,'' one teacher asks her class, ``can
tell me what famine is?''
</P>
<P>
   He asks one of the popular girls to go out with him. Then we see
he has asked her as an act of irony; she is 100 feet away and
flirting with another boy. Meanwhile, his sister Jennifer is
attempting to sleep her way to popularity.
</P>
<P>
   His mother is divorced and depressed and has shoved her kids
into a corner of her life. By the time David pushes the button on
the remote, Ross has you genuinely believing that this late-'90s
teen-ager could watch, for escape, reruns of a 45-year-old TV
series so often that he's a ``Pleasantville'' trivia ace.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he acknowledges its cliched falsity, David nestles
into the show because in Pleasantville everyone has a place and
there's the comfort of predictability. His own life has no
coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Then David and Jennifer enter the black-and-white universe of
``Pleasantville,'' where they replace the show's Bud and Mary Sue,
the adolescent children of George and Betty Parker (William H. Macy
and Joan Allen). Think of the fifties' ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross wonderfully pokes fun at the era's production-design (Betty
cooks in silk dresses, heels and pearls) and dialogue. The
``swells'' and ``keens'' and ``by-gollys'' make you flinch-laugh in
his sharp-eared reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ross really starts working the veins of potential. Sharp
becomes clever, clever deepens into intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   David quickly discovers that no one in Pleasantville is aware of
anything that hasn't appeared in an episode of the show. Firemen
will roll up, sirens going, to rescue a kitty up a tree. But run
into the firehouse and yell ``Fire!'' and they'll just stare at
you.
</P>
<P>
   He also realizes that the introduction of outside information,
and any deviation by himself as Bud from the ``reality'' of what
the ``real'' Bud does in the reruns, could destabilize
Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Mr. Johnson, the soda jerk in the soda shop where
Bud works, is always seen wiping the countertop when Bud walks in.
When this new Bud, who has the volition to be late, is late, Mr.
Johnson is confused by the fact that he has nothing to do but wipe
the countertop until Bud gets there. He wipes holes in the
linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer as Mary Sue is, almost literally, the Eve of this
twin-beds-only garden. She is heedless of David's cautions. When
she introduces sex to the captain of the basketball team, and the
guy explains the concept to the other guys, the players immediately
begin missing shots. In Pleasantville before the fall, every player
made every shot, even in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sue explains sex to her mother. And gray-scale mother turns
into color. Pleasantville starts to turn to color, rose by rose.
This sounds rather corny, but in Ross' hand it isn't at all. It's
sweet and optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than sex,'' David explains to Jennifer about the
colorizing phenomenon. Passion has come to Pleasantville, passion
as an amalgam of choices, volition, discovery. Books are blank
(they're props, after all), but if David thinks about ``Life on the
Mississippi,'' print will appear on the pages. Pleasantville's
teen-agers line up for the library.
</P>
<P>
   As if we were aware how much this is beginning to sound like a
``Twilight Zone'' episode, Ross deliberately emphasizes the
association _ that the town's teen-agers' turning into color is
disturbing to Pleasantville's '50s-rigid adults.
</P>
<P>
   Poor George comes home, puts his hat on the hat rack, hangs up
his coat and says, ``Honey, I'm home.'' But there is no Betty. No
dinner. And George dies not know what to do, other than to walk
through the house saying, ``Honey, I'm home.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant male, Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh), says darkly,
``If George doesn't get his dinner, it could happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross makes one of his few miscalculations here, getting a bit
heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   This is a small complaint. ``Pleasantville,'' an accomplished
film, moves at a pace for contemplation, daring in this market. It
integrates visual and aural elements with remarkable precision.
When everybody is this tightly bunched on the same page _ actors,
designers, the editor _ it measures the director.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the movies that has an intellectual afterlife. For
several days after you see it, your mind might drift back to how
the universe of ``Pleasantville'' works, and you'll find a few more
scoops of ice cream in a carton you thought you'd emptied. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Pleasantville'' &QL; 
Starring: Tobey McGuire and Reese Witherspoon &QL; 
Rating: PG-13 for some thematic elements emphasizing sexuality, and
for language. &QL;

WITH ACCURATE PERVERSITY, THIS FILM IS TITLED `HAPPINESS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think Todd Solondz's previous film, ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse,'' was despairing and misanthropic, get a load of his new
one.
</P>
<P>
   With entirely accurate perversity, he titled it ``Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the film is happy. Not for a moment. If anyone thinks
he is happy, he is comically and patheticly self-delusional.
</P>
<P>
   The big-gross-out, hair-grooming gag in ``There's Something
About Mary?'' That's Solondz's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   We can laugh for orthodox and understandable reasons at one
level of Solondz's comedy. We can laugh and call it ``black
comedy'' when Solondz moves to incessant and agonizing humiliation,
obscene phone calls, suicide, murder and bodies chopped up and
stored in Baggies. We laugh as defense at embarrassment in
uncomfortable sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   When Solondz gets to his carefully handled extreme, pedophilia,
we don't know what to do. Often, when we don't know what to do, we
laugh. That is reflexive and quite human, and it is not cruel.
</P>
<P>
   There is no protagonist as such. The relationships radiate from
the three sisters of a New Jersey family: Successful writer Helen
(Lara Flynn Boyle), centered and settled housewife Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson) and youngest Joy (Jane Adams), who is successful at
utterly nothing and settled nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Joy looks at the merciless world with helpless wide eyes and
writes songs with lyrics like, ``Happiness, where are you/I've
searched so long for you; Happiness, what are you/I haven't got a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The two elder sisters measure their ``happiness'' by defining
the word in ways to assure the unhappiness of their youngest
sister; they cannibalize some of what they assume is happiness from
her.
</P>
<P>
   A ``relationship'' is this film describes another bump in a
nexus of interlocking cruelties, humiliations, rejection,
exploitation or predation.
</P>
<P>
   In the nexus: The sisters' parents are separating after 40
years. Helen's mouth-breathing neighbor Allen (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman makes desperately obscene phone calls to Helen (he's
terrified, of course, when their pathologies align and she responds
to them). Bill (Dylan Baker) is Allen's therapist, Trish's husband
and the conscientious father of three who is especially attentive
and patient to 12-year-old Billy (Rufus Read) and his questions
about sexual maturation.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bill who finds himself succumbing to pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Given the allowance that pedophilia may be approached in comedic
film, Solondz is not exploitative. Pedophilia is powerfully denoted
but nowhere close to depicted.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound like Solondz's treatment carries the weight of
condemnation. But it is measure of Solondz's precise control over
what he's doing that we are fully repelled; he creeps us out to
such a dgree that it's the moral equivalent to censure.
</P>
<P>
   The film is extraordinarily well-acted. Solondz is gifted at the
humor of outrage, and he takes risks. But at two hours and 20
minutes, the film is punishingly overlong.
</P>
<P>
   One of Solondz's clear objectives is to push us outside the zone
of comfort we count on comedy to provide. He's slam-dunked that. &QL;

EVIL LURKS IN THRILLER `APT PUPIL' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hands of director Bryan Singer, who brought us ``The
Usual Suspects,'' ``Apt Pupil'' is a very unusual, quietly intense,
often uncomfortable thriller.
</P>
<P>
   TriStar Pictures is being very low-key about the Stephen King
connection to ``Apt Pupil.'' King wrote the novella, but this is
not like the usually disappointing scare movies that are made from
King works.
</P>
<P>
   If you embrace most films made from King, this may not be what
you want. Not a horror movie in the traditional sense, some genuine
horror exists here. If you dismiss the movie because King wrote the
book, remember he also was the source for ``Stand By Me (The
Body)'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption.'' ``Apt Pupil'' even came
from the same story collection as those two novella's, ``Different
Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a Los Angeles-area high school
student in 1984. He's clean-cut, a good student, popular, athletic
and disarmingly shy with girls.
</P>
<P>
   When his class studies the World War II Holocaust, Todd becomes
obsessed with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing an old man on a bus, Todd feels the shock of recognition.
He's seen that face in photos of Nazi war criminals. The old man
(Ian McKellen) lives in Todd's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead several weeks. Todd comes to the old man's door with
documentation, including fingerprints (verified on the Internet)
that the old man is Nazi concentration camp monster Kurt Dussander.
</P>
<P>
   Dussander pleads innocence at first until it's obvious Todd has
proof and the will to report him.
</P>
<P>
   Todd blackmails Dussander into telling him detailed stories
about the horrors of the camps. This goes on for months, with Todd
making greater demands.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd has underestimated his victim, and soon becomes trapped
in a bizarre power-love-fear relationship with Dussander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' is a deliberately-paced and well-considered film.
Taking time to develop atmosphere, Singer fills the film with
tight, dark, intense moments. McKellen certainly deserves
considerable credit, too.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is psychological rather than violent, disturbing
rather than scary. It's not as strong as it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of extreme close-ups in the first of the film
is effective, but sometimes too much. The movie does not have a
standard three act development _ situation, complication,
resolution _ adding to the sense of not knowing what will happen
next.
</P>
<P>
   King's original ending has been dropped by screen-writer Brandon
Boyce.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen _ Sir Ian McKellen _ is one of the stalwarts of the
British stage. His Dussander is a complex, understated and
intensely real enigma.
</P>
<P>
   Todd's average kid image and the way it is seduced by horror may
be the movie's scariest element. The film does not suggest that
Todd is a fascist or racist or potential skinhead. This is not
political commentary, but a more general consideration of evil.
That such a ``nice boy'' can be obsessed with horrid things is a
more frightening concept than an evil bigot.
</P>
<P>
   Renfro (``Sleepers''), while hidden a bit in the shade of
McKellen's screen-commanding presence, turns in a very strong
performance that is also underplayed and hard to read. We remain
guessing about how he will behave to the end.
</P>
<P>
   David Schwimmer (``Friends''), who has usually been unimpressive
on screen, comes off very well here in a small dramatic part. He
plays Todd's helpful school counselor who gets a very rude
awakening. Bruce Davison and Joe Morton also appear in small roles.
</P>
<P>
   Singer presents the climactic scenes in such a way that
something more than individual evil is strongly implied. He
suggests an entity of pure evil exists on its own, eager to
transfer itself from Dussander to Todd. But again, Singer allows
you freedom to take that interpretation or leave it alone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Apt Pupil'' &QL; 
Starring: Ian McKellen, Brad Renfro, David Schwimmer &QL; 
Rated: R, for scenes of strong violence, language and brief
sexuality. &QL;

LAME `ORGAZMO' PARODIES PORN, MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone you knew made the movie ``Orgazmo'' for their college
film class, you would pat them gently on the back and _ because you
are a friend _ lie. ``Very amusing in spots. Now you should try
making an adult film.'' That is, a film for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgazmo'' is a parody of bad martial arts, superhero and porno
movies that is worse than the films it parodies.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few crude, funny moments laced here and there
between the increasingly long and tedious martial arts fight scene
parodies, but they are hardly worth 94 minutes of your life.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated NC-17 for ``explicit sexual content and
dialogue,'' but only the latter really applies _ although in one
scene, a gigantic woman (we're talking the size on ``The Jerry
Springer Show'') in a tiny bikini, sits on top of a fully dressed
man pretending to have sex. The woman is dubbed with a deep man's
voice saying lots of dirty words. That's supposed to get laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There also are lots of superhero gadgets that are shaped like
male body parts _ well, one body part in particular. But few real
people parts are on display.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Orgazmo's'' scenes are amazingly prudish, considering
the subject matter. There is one flash of a bare breast. Elsewhere,
when a woman is just about to take off her bikini top, our view is
teasingly blocked by a naked male derriere stepping in front of the
camera. It's a running gag (gag is right) through the entire movie.
</P>
<P>
   However, before you take your church group to see it, be assured
the movie has more than enough four-letter words describing sex
acts and sexual parts to earn the NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of church groups, the movie pokes fun at Christians _
to be more specific, Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this 1997 movie even being released in real theaters,
instead of floundering around at college campus midnight movies,
where it belongs? Because Trey Parker, the creator of the TV
animated series ``South Park,'' wrote, directed and stars in it,
and he's considered ``hot'' right now.
</P>
<P>
   Parker plays Joe Young, a door-to-door Mormon missionary
assigned to Los Angeles. Young happens to ring the door of a
gangster/porn movie producer just when the producer is looking for
a clean-cut martial arts expert to star in his new ``Orgazmo''
porno superhero series. Parker takes the part.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is done on the exaggerated self-parody level of the
old ``Batman'' TV series, and wears out its welcome even faster.
</P>
<P>
   As director, Parker shows little talent here, though the movie's
low budget is clearly a factor. The set-ups are almost as crude as
for the porn movie within the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Parker's pretty weak, too. Most of the cast is
plain awful, even when they are not pretending to be bad. Matt
Stone, Parker's co-star in ``BASEketball,'' appears from time to
time as a character who begins every statement with, ``I don't want
to sound queer, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Only Robyn Lynne Raab, as Young's Mormon fiancee, seems to have
understood the difference between satirizing and broad mugging.
She's fun to watch. &QL;

`SOLDIER' DIALOGUE SCANT, STORY LINE SLIM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For ``Soldier,'' Kurt Russell spent a year bulking up. He didn't
need that time to hone his acting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's the top-billed star, Russell has less than 100 words
of dialogue for ``Soldier.'' He plays Todd, a near-future warrior
raised since birth to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   For Todd _ a name scant more macho than, say, Chad or Skip _ two
sentences seem like a filibuster, and those sentences are short.
You almost expect him to say, ``Me, Todd,'' Tarzan-style.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to dull dialogue _ and a dull film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' isn't offered as an action romp so much as a
character study, and with Todd, there's not much character to know.
</P>
<P>
   The early setup quickly takes him from infancy through childhood
training to combat campaigns for an unnamed future government.
</P>
<P>
   This is fine with Todd. He lives to kill _ not out of bloodlust,
but out of duty. But one day he and his comrades become obsolete.
Faster, tougher supersoldiers have been bred to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   By accident, Todd winds up on a garbage planet _ a world where
Earth's refuse is dumped. This is bad sci-fi. It presumes that it's
cheaper to transport dead weight through interstellar space than
recycle or incinerate it on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It also presumes that habitable worlds are a dime a dozen and
make better garbage heaps than our own solar system's barren,
airless moons.
</P>
<P>
   On this planet, Todd finds a small society of scruffy but happy
castaways. Think ``Waterworld,'' only it's a low-tech
``Garbageworld.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate and script contrivance would have it, the same
supersoldiers who replaced Todd arrive for training, in which
unauthorized castaways are fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' then turns into a western. It's ``High Noon'' with
Russell standing in for Gary Cooper _ or for ``The Magnificent
Seven'' all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The action is handled fairly well, but it's routine, and there's
no satisfaction in seeing Todd waste men who are no more
bloodthirsty than he is, such as a sympathetic Jason Scott Lee. The
only true villain is an amoral, gutless officer (Jason Isaacs) who
sends others to their deaths while keeping his hands clean.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Russell. He did his job, and he's a remarkable
physical specimen at 47. Director Paul Anderson (``Mortal Kombat'')
and writer David Webb Peoples (``Unforgiven'') are the ones who let
us down.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples also adapted ``Blade Runner'' from Philip K. Dick's
novel, but that doesn't make him a sci-fi whiz.
</P>
<P>
   In going to that well again on his own, he's concocted a story
that's leaden and derivative _ so much so that writer Harlan
Ellison could raise a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   When James Cameron's ``The Terminator'' hit big in 1984, Ellison
hurled a legal challenge since its story paralleled a 1960s ``Outer
Limits'' episode that he wrote. Ellison won, getting belated screen
credit for the film (in which star Arnold Schwarzenegger, by the
way, spoke just 16 lines).
</P>
<P>
   Peoples' ``Soldier'' mirrors that same ``Outer Limits'' episode,
in which a future man is trained since birth to be a taciturn,
single-minded killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   And the name of that episode? ``Soldier.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MAKING TRACKS ACROSS EUROPE: Trying to pin down a wanderer
 &HT;    (With Photo.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Joe Murray has been traveling around Western
Europe by train. This is one in a series of stories.)
</P>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ On the day I met Douglas Foley, he was a
street musician playing Irish tunes on his guitar at the juncture
of a couple of ancient walkways that wind, labyrinth-like, behind
the streets of Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Another place, another time, he might have been a shepherd,
construction worker, factory manager, bartender, agricultural
worker or salesman.
</P>
<P>
   At age 46, he has been all of those things in most all of the
countries of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 17 years, on and off, Douglas Foley has been a
vagabond, a wandering minstrel, writing songs and poems as he makes
his way through life on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays he is living in Barcelona, though he qualifies the
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to survive,'' he said, ``is more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a romantic idea that you play music on the street
and you get a load of money,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   It's anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is fairly fierce, and there always the police
sticking their nose in, moving you along.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley had been in Barcelona for three weeks. He said he hopes to
stay a year or two, and will be looking for work playing in bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barcelona isn't the worst place I've been,'' he allowed. There
was Paris, and before that, Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   But in the beginning, there was Ireland, where he still has
family.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, thin and brown-haired, he also still has Ireland in the
lilt of his voice and in the twinkle of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   How did he come to be the way he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got four hours or so I could tell you the real
story. But let's just say something changed in my life, and I
decided to get out of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The real story is being told instead in the book he is ``trying
to write _ something personal, philosophical, biographical,
whatever comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   And is this the life he likes best?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' he said, smiling for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said he has spiritual reasons for doing what he's doing,
which defies logic, if not sanity, at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``No logical, sane person would take off for Barcelona with a
guitar and no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay a price for everything. For me, it's penury,
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   And in return?
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a certain freedom. But, then again, how free are you
if you don't have money for your ticket out of here, or the price
of your next meal?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I suppose I am free to say what I think. I am very much
myself. I don't have to be like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a moment and then added:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what I choose.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask: But don't you ever get lonesome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course,'' he said, brightening as if the thought had
just now occurred to him.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when you get lonesome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cry,'' he said, laughing.

DURING HEATING SEASON, A HUMID HOUSE CAN BE A HAPPY HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's autumn. Temperatures are dropping and heat
thermostats are being turned up. This also means that we are going
to be spending even more time indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors, according
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While a great many of
us will be warm and comfy, millions of others will suffer from an
environment that's too dry and possibly a harbinger of air
pollution. That's partly because many of our homes were built, or
modified, to be tighter and with more insulation and vapor barriers
in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s. As a result, much of
the ventilation has been eliminated. And central heating can dry
out the air.
</P>
<P>
   Common physical symptoms for residents of a dry home are dry
eyes, throat and nose, itchy skin, respiratory discomfort, static
electricity and frequent colds. A house that's too dry can wreak
havoc with anything made from wood, from floors to furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sean McCarthy, product manager for Aprilaire Whole
House Humidifiers in Madison, Wis., your house may need added
humidity if it is showing any of the following signs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Splits or cracks in woodwork or walls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wooden doors that show gaps or that no longer fit tightly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaps between the boards in hardwood floors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Widening joints in cabinets or wooden paneling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loose or wobbly chair legs and arms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pianos that don't stay in tune.
</P>
<P>
   Super dry air steals moisture wherever it can find it. And, as
wood loses moisture, some types may shrink more than 7 percent,
according to the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wood structure of a typical new 2,100-square-foot home
contains an astounding 635 gallons of water,'' McCarthy said. ``And
as long as the indoor humidity level stays around 35 percent, the
moisture content of the wood remains pretty much constant. However,
during the heating season the relative humidity of a home's indoor
air may plummet to 13 percent or less. That's dryer than Death
Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should try to maintain a humidity level between 30
percent and 60 percent in the home, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Too much humidity can create condensation on cold windows, cause
corrosion and rot and the growth of molds and dust mites, which are
well known allergens found in most households. On the other hand,
if humidity levels are too low, viruses and bacteria in the home
can spread and increase the onset of respiratory infections, hay
fever and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   We all add some humidity to our living space on a daily basis by
cooking, bathing and doing laundry. But that's usually not enough
moisture to maintain the desired level. A more dependable source is
needed. Houses with steam or hot water heat and radiators have a
built-in source. But that's not true of most U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   During the heating season, more than 25 million Americans use
humidifiers to make their homes more comfortable, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several types to choose among, depending on whether
you live in a house or apartment and the type of heating system.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective is a whole-house humidifier, which mounts on
the heating ductwork of an existing forced-air heating or
heating-cooling system and has a constant water supply, eliminating
refilling, according to John Nolan, office manager for Family Danz
Humidifiers in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   This central humidifier is controlled by a room-mounted
humidistat to monitor the outdoor temperature and automatically
adjust the indoor humidity level. Central humidifiers will not work
on heating systems where there is no ductwork, including hot water
and electric.
</P>
<P>
   There are three types of central humidifiers: bypass with a
drain, bypass without a drain and spray type.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that the bypass with a drain is the best because it
runs from the supply side of your furnace to the humidifier. Warm
air is circulated through a water panel and sprayed into the
ductwork. All excess water goes to a drain and into a sump pump,
eliminating any standing water. This is excellent for people who
have allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about two to three hours to install a central
humidity system depending on the condition of your furnace,'' Nolan
said. ``A standard model costs approximately $425 installed and
will cover between 1,000 to 3,000 square feet.''
</P>
<P>
   If you use a furnace-mounted humidifier, look for one with a
flow-through drain that eliminates the reservoir altogether,
McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Portable humidifiers, which begin at $20 for a tabletop model to
under $200 for a floor model, are useful for homes without a
central duct system and apartments or areas of the house that are
dryer than others. The downside of some portable models is that
water droplets come out rather than a fine mist, which can soak
anything the vent is pointing at, and they must be frequently
refilled.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports magazine reported that the best tabletop unit
in its tests was a warm-mist model by Duracraft, DH-904, for $70.
The magazine concluded that it featured an accurate humidistat and
easy cleaning. It can run for almost a day between refills and is
effective enough to cover more than 900 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports picked the Toastmaster 3435 and Emerson HD14W1
and the HD1SW to be almost equal in overall performance and in
price in a console model. The Toastmaster, which has the more
accurate humidistat, sells for between $100 and $170; and the
Emerson, which covers 3,070 square feet to Toastmaster's 2,140
square feet, costs approximately $130 to $160.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a portable humidifier, the U.S. Consumer Products
Safety Commission recommends cleaning and disinfecting the
reservoir regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions to
prevent possible growth of mold or bacteria. Hard water with a high
mineral content can also build up or clog the humidifier, hampering
its performance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's best to shop around before you buy because there are so
many ways a humidifier emits moisture. Evaporative models use a fan
to pull air through a water-soaked filter. Impeller models break
water up into tiny droplets as it is expelled into the air.
Steam-mist models boil water to release steam. Warm-mist
humidifiers utilize a combination of boiled water and cool air to
create steam, and ultrasonic humidifiers use sound waves to break
water down into a mist.
</P>
<P>
   Cost upkeep is a factor. Some models cost more to run than
others or require regular filter replacements, the use of only
distilled or soft or demineralization cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The proper humidification can save money on your heating bill by
helping you to feel warmer at relatively cool temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, indoor air pollution can be two to five
times higher, and occasionally 100 times higher, than outdoor
levels. Pollen and other allergens can easily find their way
indoors by way of clothing and open windows.
</P>
<P>
   With tight houses, many airborne contaminants have become
trapped without adequate means for their removal, according to
Jerry Orr, creator of the American Lung Association's Healthy House
Project.
</P>
<P>
   One way to reduce indoor pollutants is to use effective furnace
filters and regularly change them. High-energy efficiency filters
can be up to 30 times more effective than Fiberglas filters in
removing dust and other small particles from the air, according to
Orr.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dinner chargers are the large dishes that are
used under the dinner plate _ not the people who use credit cards
to pay for their meals.
</P>
<P>
   The decorative oversized plates, which can measure more than 11
inches in diameter, may be used beneath dinner plates year-round.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being decorative and festive, chargers insulate
the surface of your table from hot dinner plates. They are most
often used for formal dinners and luncheons.
</P>
<P>
   You don't eat directly off of the charger during a formal
dinner. (If made of china or silver, they can be used also as
buffet plates or serving platters.)
</P>
<P>
   When to remove the charger plate is a matter of personal
preference. Traditionally it was removed prior to the entree.
Today, it may be removed following the first or main course, but
usually before dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, which also are referred to as base, place, service or
presentation plates, act as a sort of placemat to protect table
linens and decorative or delicate placemats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, a charger was a large, usually wooden,
plate or dish on which a joint of meat was served and cut. The cut
meat was served on similar, but smaller wooden plates or dishes
called trenchers. Later, wooden chargers came pewter and
earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   Today, chargers come in various colors and finishes, some
ornamented with a decorative theme, such as the Christmas chargers
_ costing $15 to $25 each _ available at Pier I Imports. The
selection includes wood, ceramic, brass, gold, silver and bronze,
as well as blue, burgundy and green.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers can also be found in most housewares sections of
department stores and restaurant supply companies.
</P>
<P>
   A set of four 13-inch, gold-powdered/coated-matte finished
chargers from Lillian Vernon costs $30.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to buy actual chargers to go with your china or
everyday dishes. A set of oversize antique dinner plates, large
pewter or earthenware plates, will serve the same purpose.

IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE SO MANY OPTIONS AS THIS 25-YEAR-OLD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A am a 25-year-old college graduate and recently started a
new job paying $45,000 a year. My company offers a 401(k) plan
managed by Fidelity to which I can contribute up to 15 percent of
my base salary. My company will match 150 percent of the first 2
percent, and 50 percent of the next 3 percent, with full vesting
happening after two years of employment, a milestone I will reach
in July of 2000. I also have the option of investing from 1 to 10
percent of my salary in a company stock purchase program which
allows the purchase of company stock at 85 percent of the fair
market value. I am debt-free at the moment, but some expected
future expenditures include a new car and a house within the next
five years, and the possibility of taking two years off from work
to pursue an advanced degree in the next five to 10 years. I would
like to begin saving for these events as well as retirement, and I
am considering my alternatives, including these company-sponsored
options and a Roth IRA. How should I allocate my savings to best
prepare myself for the future, and which Fidelity investments, if
any, should I pursue?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A.F., Gresham, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that you have so many options that it's hard
to set priorities. For example, if you were to buy a home within
the next five years, would the idea of taking two years off for
advanced study shortly thereafter be realistic? If you buy a new
car, will you be able to save enough for a home down payment?
</P>
<P>
   But an easy place to start is with the 401(k). It would be just
plain silly not to take full advantage of the handsome company
matches of your savings. The company will put in $1,350 a year for
your first $900 contribution, and add $675 for your next $1,350 _
meaning that when you put $2,250 in the 401(k), the company adds
$2,025. Even if your contributions and the company matches never
change, by the time you're 65, that pool would grow to $1,211,722,
assuming 10 percent average annual investment returns. So I would
consider contributions of at least 5 percent of your earnings to
the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   As for graduate school, a home, and a new car _ I would rank
them in that order. My suggestion would be to postpone the idea of
a home until after you have completed your graduate studies,
especially since the advanced degree should mean that you will earn
a higher salary afterward.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, I'd rather see you save money for graduate
school than buy a new car. Let's presume you can manage to save a
total of 15 percent of your pretax salary. That comes to $6,750 a
year. If the first $2,250 of that is going into the 401(k), that
leaves you with $4,500 that you might spread among an education
account, purchase of company stock, a Roth IRA, and a new car. If
you went with the car purchase, you might expect a monthly payment
of about $300 _ representing 80 percent of your saving power. I'd
rather see you go with a clunker, or a series of clunkers, while
you plan to make that big investment in your education.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, I'd bypass the Roth IRA, not because tax-free money
in retirement isn't great, but because the better investment at
this point is in building your future earning power.
</P>
<P>
   As for the company stock, the 15 percent discount is attractive,
but most of your goals are short- to intermediate-term, so I would
save that prospect for later in your career. At this point, CDs and
money market accounts should be your major savings vehicles, aside
from the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   For your 401(k) program, I suggest you begin by building a core
holding, using a vehicle such as Fidelity Growth and Income fund
(closed to new investors, but still available in many 401(k)
programs) or Fidelity Spartan Market Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm 29 and looking to retire by age 50 or 55. My only
investments consist of two 401(k) plans, 223 shares of 3Comm stock,
and $20,000 in a money market account. The 401(k) plans were
established with former employers, and we can't add to them. Mine
consists of $15,625 invested in Founders Growth and $15,619 in
American Century Twentieth Century Ultra. My wife's has $7,995 in
Putnam Growth and Income, $3,651 in Putnam Voyager, and $3,536 in
Putnam New Opportunities. I'm considering rolling the two plans
into IRAs. Based on this information, how should we align our
portfolios to reach a goal of $4,000 a month to get by on in
retirement?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  G.O., Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Basically, the bigger problem isn't how the money is
invested, but the fact that you need to keep contributing to it. At
first blush, it might seem your proposal would work if you retired
at age 55. Presuming 10 percent average annual portfolio growth you
would have $874,426 at the age of 55; you might then invest this to
produce an income stream of $56,900 a year. The trouble is that in
26 years, that $56,900 will have a buying power of $20,523 in
today's money, assuming that inflation averages 4 percent over
those 26 years. Even if it ran at only a 3 percent rate, the
current buying power would be only $26,384.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the problem from the other end, and assuming 4 percent
inflation, you would need to have an $89,294 income stream in 21
years if you wanted the same buying power as $48,000 in today's
money; you would need a $103,516 annual income stream if you waited
to retire at age 55. Moreover, you don't want to limit your worries
to age 55 _ you'll want to think about the effect of inflation on
your savings later in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line here is that far from being $800,000 or so, the
target should be closer to $2 million. To achieve this, with
presumed 10 percent average annual returns, would require monthly
deposits of $820.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, you have too much concentration in the
large-cap stocks. Only Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities
funds, both with mid-cap portfolios, give you exposure to other
market elements, and they collectively represent less than 10
percent of the whole. I suggest that you do roll over the 401(k)s
to IRAs, and then invest no more than 50 percent in large-cap core
positions. Finally, unless you view that $20,000 in the money
markets as your emergency savings, I would put it to work harder,
at the most conservatively in a balanced fund, and otherwise in
stock funds along the lines of those recommended above.

   POLLSTERS SAY BOXER IS REBOUNDING IN (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Polls in California show that Sen. Barbara Boxer is
on the rebound in her effort to win re-election against Republican
Matt Fong, a prominent Democratic and Republican pollster agreed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   GOP pollster Ed Goeas and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake
forecast at a joint appearance that Boxer will prevail on Nov. 3 in
her hard-fought bid to win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas and Lake, both nationally known campaign consultants,
agreed that Republicans would make gains in the House and Senate as
a result of the mid-term congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to arrive in California Saturday
to participate over the weekend in three private fund raisers for
Boxer in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have
appeared repeatedly at fund raisers for Boxer in both California
and Washington, D.C., to help bolster the liberal Marin County
Democrat who served in Congress for 10 years before winning a
Senate seat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's daughter Nicole is married to Mrs. Clinton's younger
brother, Tony Rodham. Their young son, Zachary, is the president's
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Lake said efforts by the first lady to help energize women
voters in California will help Boxer retain her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Women voters in California helped Clinton carry the state and
its 54 electoral votes in 1992 and 1996 _ the first time a Democrat
won the state in back-to-back elections since 1944 and 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Lake said appearances by Mrs. Clinton coupled with campaign
advertising by Boxer are helping to bolster Boxer's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxer is coming back,'' Lake said. ``Anything could happen.
But Boxer is starting to eke ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times survey of likely voters published Friday
showed Boxer reversing a 5 percentage point deficit of a month ago
to lead Fong by 5 percentage points, 49 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas said Boxer is gaining strength. Boxer is ``starting to
build a lead and some momentum out in California and beginning to
pull away,'' Goeas said.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas predicted that, over-all, the GOP will pick up a total of
five Senate seats, boosting the Republican majority to a
filibuster-proof margin of 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas said Republicans will pick up 14 to 17 House seats _ far
short of the 56-seat gain in 1994 when the GOP took control of the
House and Senate for the first time since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Lake predicted that Democrats, who hold 45 Senate seats, will
lose only a single Senate seat to a Republican in the all of the
Senate races and only five to seven House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Lake and Goeas agreed that Clinton's appearance will help
Boxer's campaign. Clinton will raise campaign donations that can be
used in last minute broadcast advertising. His visit will be
helpful ``energizing to the Democratic base,'' Lake added.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Clinton's presidency will be determined by the
outcome of the federal elections. The GOP-controlled House of
Representatives is pursuing an impeachment investigation into
Clinton in the wake of sex-and-cover-up allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate will conduct any trial on impeachment
charges if the allegations are referred by the House. Clinton is
only the third president in history to face an impeachment inquiry.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Roberto Benigni and
Giorgio Cantarini in scenes from Benigni's film, ``Life Is
Beautiful.''
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful.'' That's not my commentary on the state of
the world, which might seem entirely inappropriate in view of the
stock market, Russia, the Far East and Bill Clinton.
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful'' (``La Vita e Bella'') is a new movie,
modestly budgeted and one of the best films to come along in years.
It opens throughout North America in late October and November but
look for it to be around at Oscar time.
 &HT;    It's Italian with English subtitles and is set in l939 as war
envelopes Europe. The picture stars comic actor Roberto Benigni
(sometimes labeled the Italian Woody Allen) who also wrote and
directed it. He plays the naive Guido who courts and marries the
beautiful teacher Dora (played by his wife of l8 years Nicoletta
Braschi) and dreams of owning his own bookshop. He ignores the
growing incursions of Fascism into his life and the new anti-Jewish
laws until the Nazi occupation sweeps him and his son into a
concentration camp. His gentile wife, refusing to be separated from
her husband and son, is also imprisoned.
 &HT;    It starts off like a Chaplin romance crossed with a Marx
brother's farce and ends up as the spellbinding story of a father's
all encompassing love for his son.
 &HT;    While the conjunction of comedy and Holocaust makes one wince,
Benigni miraculously manages to use humor as an essential element
in the story. For in order to protect his son from the real horrors
of the death camp, Guido pretends to the youngster that the whole
experience is merely a game with bizarre rules. If the boy can hold
out, can stick to the game plan, he and only he will win the grand
prize.
 &HT;    One can only marvel at a movie that makes you laugh when you
know the only sane response is to cry, a movie that makes you come
out of the theater with a smile on your face when you know you
should be in the grip of depression. A man who can do that is not
just an actor and director _ he's a magician.
 &HT;    He could also teach Hollywood a few things. Soon after I saw
``Life Is Beautiful,'' I also saw the Robin Williams extravaganza
``What Dreams May Come,'' which came with a phenomenal price tag of
$85 million and flounders in a sea of computer generated art and
banal dialogue.
 &HT;    Then I viewed Oprah Winfrey in ``Beloved,'' which valiantly
tries to take Toni Morrison's book about a runaway slave who has
killed her own children and translate it into screen material. The
result is ``The Exorcist'' tossed into the middle of a very serious
story. Some novels should simply remain on the page.
 &HT;    Both big commercial films were supposed to be about the infinite
capacity of the human spirit to rise above the miseries of the
world. ``Life Is Beautiful'' actually shows us how to do this.
 &HT;    Made at a fraction of the cost of ``Dreams'' and ``Beloved,'' it
depends entirely on the power of the imagination, on sheer talent,
ingenuity and a simple joy in living.
 &HT;    Benigni admits making this movie was a risky business but he
hoped the early slapstick humor in Guido's romance would make the
camp scenes even more deeply felt. ``I believe laughter saves us,
it forces us to consider the other side of things, the surreal
funny side,'' he says. ``Being able to imagine prevents us from
being reduced to ashes, from being crushed like twigs. It gives us
the sense to survive the endless night.''
 &HT;    Benigni noted his initial reluctance to make a comedy that deals
with the agony of the Holocaust. ``I knew my film would bring up
some very sensitive issues. When the idea first took hold of me, it
was very much like an illumination, a revelation, and my very first
reaction was to retreat. But then I realized the retreat was caused
by fear and in the end my feelings about the story won over the
fear.''
 &HT;    Benigni says he wanted to absorb as deep an understanding as
possible of the real experience of those who lived, loved and
suffered through the camps. He consulted survivor groups and
listened to dozens of personal accounts. ``With Guido I wanted to
create a character who was totally integrated into Italian society,
who lives his life, does his job, isn't the least interested in
politics and then with one blow, his life is suddenly over. That's
the way it happened to many people.''
 &HT;    ``Life Is Beautiful'' won't get the big studio blitz that
``Dreams'' and ``Beloved'' have been given. There won't be huge
billboards all over town, but it has already won top kudos in film
festivals from Cannes to Jerusalem to Montreal. It's an antidote to
the state of affairs around us.

<P>
   We've all had them. We got them falling off bicycles and swings
as children and we still get them as adults.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about bruises _ nature's little tatoos _ those
painful injuries involving rupture of small blood vessels with
resulting black and blue marks that never seem to go away.
</P>
<P>
   But while it will always take some time for the skin
discoloration to disappear, we can take steps to ease the
discomfort much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There are two natural herbs which can be very effective for
bruises: arnica and calendula, the latter having the common name of
marigold. Let's take a look at each of them and the ways in which
they can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Arnica is a native plant of Europe but was imported to America
where it now grows wild, particularly in moist soil conditions in
mountains and valleys from 3,500 to 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is also grown as a cultivated plant in some flower gardens.
It resembles many other members of the composite family with
yellow-orange sunflowerlike flower heads which bloom from April
through September. Preparations of arnica were listed in the U.S.
Pharmacopeia (the official listing of approved drugs in the United
States) from the early 1800s to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Two common names for arnica are mountain tobacco and leopard's
bane, the latter referring to its toxicity if swallowed by some
beasts, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   All the safe preparations of arnica are for external use only.
These preparations are a fluid extract, an ointment and a tea bath.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare a fluid extract, put 6 ounces of powdered arnica
flowers (which can be obtained from herbal suppliers or at some
health food stores) in a glass jar containing 8 ounces of grain
alcohol, 90 percent strength (180 proof). Stir constantly for about
10 minutes, screw a cap on the jar and let the mixture to set
overnight so that the flowers dissolve completely.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, filter the mixture through cheesecloth, bottle it
and apply a clear label. While not a pharmaceutical-grade tincture
of arnica, it is very effective in alleviating soreness from
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   An arnica tea may be made simply by placing a tablespoon of the
arnica flower-powder in a cup of boiling water and allowing it to
steep for 10 minutes. Filter the undissolved powder through
cheesecloth; the remaining warm solution may be applied to the
bruised area.
</P>
<P>
   An arnica ointment is also available at herbal outlets and
natural food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Calendula, or marigold, is a common annual found in many
household flower gardens. Its preparations, too, are for external
use only.
</P>
<P>
   For a homemade fluid extract and a tea, follow the same
directions above, using dried marigold flower petals (available at
herbal suppliers). An ointment and an oil extract can be purchased
at herbal stores.
</P>
<P>
   The ointment has the advantage of being easy to apply, and in
addition to reducing soreness it penetrates deep into the skin to
start the healing process. Calendula oil is just as soothing
properties as the ointment but lacks its staying power. However,
because it is a liquid, you can pour the oil onto cuts and bruises
you wouldn't dare to rub with an ointment.

<P>
   LONDON (Oct. 13) _ The day the letter arrived, early last year,
Marion Finlay at first thought it was junk mail. It carried a
company's logo and offered something for free, as do many
commercial leaflets flooding her mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Microsoft, the letter explained, had picked
Finlay's upper-middle-class street in the Northern London borough
of Islington for a networking experiment and was looking for
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The company wanted to create a living case study to explore how
the Internet would affect a real, local community _ as opposed to a
``virtual community'' existing only in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Participating households, the letter added, would be given a
computer, a modem, a free Internet account through the Microsoft
Network (MSN), a dedicated phone line, a selection of software, a
contribution toward their phone bills, and on-site installation and
tutoring by specialists. They would also have access to a dedicated
telephone line for troubleshooting, and to a private Web site and
bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   It was an Internet beginner's dream.
</P>
<P>
   In return for this all-expenses-paid connection to the Internet,
participants in Microsoft's MSNstreet project only had to commit to
keeping a log book of their online activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too good to be true: I had just completed a computer
course and was eager to become more involved in Internet
communication,'' said Finlay, an expatriate Canadian journalist.
</P>
<P>
   She read the letter over again, thinking that there must be a
catch. Others on her street, like Peter McCartney, a medical
researcher, thought it was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, and both Finlay and McCartney volunteered to
participate, as did 23 other households on the street, for a total
of 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later a van arrived. Technicians from Microsoft
brought in computers and connected wires, and a company was hired
to handle MSNstreet's public relations (which include preventing
journalists from publishing the street's real name).
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months into the experiment _ which was originally
planned to run for just six months _ all the participants contacted
for this article were fairly enthusiastic about the Internet and
are using it to look up stock quotes and other information, plan a
ski vacation, or keep in touch with friends and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond encouraging general Internet literacy however, what has
the ``first cyberstreet community project in Europe'' revealed
about how the Internet may affect the lives of ordinary families
and neighborhoods?
</P>
<P>
   McCartney believes the street's residents are closer socially.
``There has been a significant improvement in communication in the
street which would not have happened otherwise,'' he explained in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many things can prevent neighbors from getting to know one
another, especially in a residential street full of lawyers,
journalists and other professionals who head downtown early in the
morning and aren't back until dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a reason to approach people,'' said Jane
Judd, a literary agent who had been living on the street for years
but knew only her immediate neighbors and a couple of neighbors of
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the MSNstreet project has been the perfect substitute
for the classic cup of sugar. The shared experience of being
Internet beginners and talking about local issues on the bulletin
board ``has meant that when we meet face to face we can carry on
discussions instead of blandly talking about the weather,'' Judd
added.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson Phillips, a retired journalist, has rapidly become the
informal leader of the local online community. ``I have more time
than others to spend online,'' he said, while sitting in his
basement among piles of books and charts detailing the organization
of a street party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to know maybe 5 or 6 people in the street, now I know
at least 40 of them quite well, and some very closely,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling through dozens of messages posted on the bulletin
board, Phillips explained how the participants have been able to
exchange information like gardening tips, recommend a decent
plumber or electrician, find a trustworthy babysitter, or swap
notes on local shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have been asking for help with homework, others have
posted messages looking for somebody to receive a parcel or to feed
the cat,'' he said. ``This creates a stronger feeling of
participating in a community that cares about its members.''
</P>
<P>
   Common-interest discussions have also taken place on online.
Participants are debating a proposed municipal plan that would
introduce controlled parking on nearby streets, which has created
concerns that their street would be flooded by cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin board has also been used to gain support for a
campaign against disruptive vibrations caused by the local railway.
And when a burglar struck on the street, the news was circulated
immediately, prompting a discussion about whether the street needed
better lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these debates find their way into the ``Barnsbury
Bugle,'' the neighborhood newspaper that Phillips edits and e-mails
to other residents.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic mail appears to be the crucial application. ``I'm
addicted to e-mail,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we ever do without it?'' wondered Jane Judd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that e-mail will be used by everybody, and
that for all the talk of wiping out time zones and geographical
distances, it will become a normal way to exchange information
locally as well,'' said Andrew Graham, a professor of economics at
Balliol College in Oxford, who has been monitoring the project as
part of his research into the effects of new technologies on
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before becoming commonplace, technology needs to ``get much
easier to use,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the favorable bias of having state-of-the-art equipment
installed by specialists and the availability of constant technical
support, ``nobody has made any positive comment on the hardware and
software, or said that it was easier, faster or more powerful than
he or she expected,'' Graham commented in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own PC and Microsoft's were both badly messed up by
incompetent engineers,'' said Tom Linch, a journalist with The
Financial Times and a street resident. ``I was without any computer
at all for weeks and had to switch all my e-mail use to the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so hard to get a computer fixed properly with the
might of Microsoft standing behind the whole operation, what
chances has everyone else?'' Linch wrote in an article.

 WORKOUT IN NO TIME  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this
week's LifeBeat lifestyle package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

<P>
   If you say you have no time to workout, I'll get right to the
point:
</P>
<P>
   You're sniveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being short on time is nothing new,'' says San Diego running
coach Kevin McCarey. ``Roger Bannister was studying to be a doctor
and he only had an hour a day for running. He broke the four-minute
mile. Same constraints as you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister's example is telling. Certainly few people are as
time-crunched as doctors, too hurried to write a legible signature.
Note too that Bannister wasn't just trying to drop a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hooked on the idea of how long, but the important
point really is the quality of the exercise,'' says Ross Gerry,
assistant women's swimming coach at Stanford University. ``Can you
get a good workout in thirty minutes? Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   It's simple. Each time you exercise there are two things you can
tinker with: how long you exercise and how hard you exercise. It's
a pie with two pieces. Make one bigger, and you can pare back the
other. Want to burn 200 calories? You can walk easily for 40
minutes. Or you can cut that time in half and run. Up the
intensity, and get just as much or more from a shorter workout.
</P>
<P>
   Several years back I interviewed a runner who had not missed a
day of running in 26 years. Once on train trip he slipped in his
run when the train pulled into a station, going for a 10-minute jog
with a sprint to catch the departing train. ``Finding the time to
exercise is really no different than finding the time to shave or
eat,'' he said. ``If you want to do it, you'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are an assortment of time-efficient workouts, each about 30
minutes long. You can do the workouts at an easy pace or you can
raise the ante, the choice is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RUN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matt Giusto, who ran the 5,000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics,
also coaches recreational runners in his hometown of Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The workout below works for beginners and experts. The
difference, experts run hard during the hard portions and beginners
don't. If you're new to this kind of effort, just pick up the pace
a little during the hard portions. (This workout works great for
biking and walking too; you can also do it on a treadmill or an
exercise bike too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing is raising your heart rate for a period of
time, then recovering, then raising it again,'' says Giusto. ``That
gives you and your heart a better, more interesting workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Warm up with 10 minutes of easy running.
</P>
<P>
   Run hard for three minutes (beginners, make the pace just a
little faster than your easy pace).
</P>
<P>
   Jog two minutes easy (really relax; if you don't, you defeat the
purpose of the workout).
</P>
<P>
   Run two minutes hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jog one minute easy.
</P>
<P>
   Run one minute hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jog three minutes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Cool down with five minutes of very easy running or walking.
Light stretching, five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SWIM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get a good swim workout in 30 minutes, you need to keep a few
things in mind says Stanford coach Ross Gerry. Good idea to vary
the strokes if you can; swimming backstroke, breastroke, butterfly
and freestyle brings more muscles into play, and it helps you avoid
injury by spreading wear and tear. And keep the rest short; not
allowing for full recovery will keep your heart rate up, giving you
a better workout.
</P>
<P>
   Take 10 seconds rest between each swim.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards breastroke.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 free.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 100 yards individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   Swim 200 free.
</P>
<P>
   Kick 100 yards freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Have a few more minutes? Do six 25-yard sprints (rest 20-30
seconds between each one), then cool down with an easy 200 yard
swim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WEIGHT ROOM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a workout that builds strength and gives your heart and
lungs a buff too, courtesy of Gina Lombardi, a National Strength
and Conditioning Association certified personal trainer whose
Hollywood clients often don't have more than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced lifters should do 8-15 repetitions of each lift, run
through each group of exercises twice and take no rest until the
workout is done (that's what gets your heart involved). If you're
fairly new to lifting, or this feels like too much, do 8-15 reps,
go through each set only once, and rest 2-3 minutes between each
set.
</P>
<P>
   Expert or not, and this is critical, lift light weights. Since
you're doing a fairly large number of reps and not taking much, or
any rest, lifting heavy weights won't work. And it could injure
you.
</P>
<P>
   Warm up 5-10 minutes (light calisthcnics, jog on the treadmill,
spin easily on an exercise bike).
</P>
<P>
   Group one: One set of squats. One seat of shoulder lateral
raises. One set of abdominal crunches. One set of biceps curls.
(Experienced lifters repeat).
</P>
<P>
   Group two: One set of lunges. One set of lat pulldowns. One set
of leg curls. One set of dumbbell bench presses. (Experienced
lifters repeat).
</P>
<P>
   Group three: One set on the outer thigh machine. One set triceps
pushdowns. One set on the inner thigh machine. One set of back
extensions. (Experienced lifters repeat) Cool down 5 minutes.

THE DIRTY WORD OF THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mere six months ago, Big Tobacco stood astride the American
political scene, the colossus of evil. Every Democratic politician
railed against it. Its public approval ratings trailed Linda
Tripp's.
</P>
<P>
   Then something funny happened on the way to the ballot box:
Democrats found themselves a new bogeyman to replace the tobacco
barons. The Dems' new ``merchants of death'': Health Maintenance
Organization bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 campaign's vilification of HMOs marks the culmination
of a remarkable and speedy collapse of the industry's image. Just
five years ago, HMOs were the golden children of the busted
health-care industry, imposing the cost controls and efficiencies
everyone agreed the system needed.
</P>
<P>
   But during this summer and fall, Democratic candidates have had
a field day telling HMO horror stories. HMO has become a synonym
for heartlessness and windfall profit, and political contributions
by health insurers are blood money.
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri senate race, for example, a Democratic TV ad
declared that Republican incumbent Kit Bond would let ``insurance
company bureaucrats make your medical decisions'' because he had
accepted $200,000 from the insurance industry. An ad tarred
Illinois' Republican gubernatorial candidate George Ryan for
accepting contributions from ``exactly those HMOs that are charging
us more while providing us less.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Democrat Paul Johnson ran ads saying that incumbent
Republican Gov. Jane Hull ``has taken tens of thousands of dollars
from HMOs and big insurance companies and then steadfastly refused
to impose any meaningful reforms on an industry that is clearly out
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, Florida,
Ohio and elsewhere, Democrats have anchored their campaigns to HMO
reform and depicted opponents as shills for the health insurance
industry. The issue is the key to ``almost every race I'm involved
in,'' says one Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   HMO horror stories have spread widely and rapidly:
``drive-through'' baby deliveries, the experimental chemotherapy
denied to a child with cancer, the accountant who proposed
permitting cataract patients to have surgery on only one eye
because you need only one eye to see. (Consumers for Quality Care,
an anti-HMO group, even picks an HMO ``Casualty of the Day.'')
</P>
<P>
   All this is fertile soil for Democrats. Republicans in the
Senate, after all, did just kill a (relatively modest) HMO reform
bill. Republicans are in the pockets of the HMO and insurance
industries. (Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office told health
insurance executives to ``get off your wallets.'' And they did,
forking over millions to the GOP this election cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats' proposed reforms are not elaborate and not
unreasonable: the right to sue your HMO, the right to appeal denial
of treatment, no gag rules for doctors and easier emergency room
access. One survey showed that 90 percent of Americans support such
changes, and 85 percent would favor a candidate who supports them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political logic, this vilification of HMOs is a
dismaying manifestation of a common illness of American politics:
Something-for-Nothingism. Democrats have seized the HMO issue this
fall because it is classic entitlement politics.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are understandably ambivalent about health insurance.
When your child gets sick, you naturally despise the frugality that
made your HMO so attractive when you subscribed. Americans want _
no, expect _ health care to be both infinite and cheap. We should
have everything, paid for by someone else who shall remain
nameless.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, by pushing regulation without acknowledging its
costs, are feeding this impossible expectation.
(Something-for-Nothingism is, of course, the guiding philosophy of
almost all politics. There is no reason health care should be an
exception.)
</P>
<P>
   A principled Republican response to the Democratic anti-HMO
campaign _ and a response that a few Republicans are actually
making _ is to say: ``OK, if you want to have the right to sue your
HMO, you are going to have accept x percent higher premiums and
that's going to price y thousand customers out of the health
insurance market.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans, who are as willing to pander as the next
guy (heck, more willing), are afraid to fight on the merits.
Instead, they are countering one bogeyman with another, claiming
that voters should reject anti-HMO Dems because they are beholden
to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response is too bad, because a fight on the merits is
exactly the way Americans could make an informed decision about how
much HMO regulation they want.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that
Americans in managed care plans are basically content with their
own care. But they are more worried about the future than those in
fee-for-service plans. Why? Largely because they have heard so many
alarming tales about HMOs. Never mind that no hard evidence exists
that American health care has actually deteriorated under managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   This is why managed care is a genuinely confusing issue: Should
voters believe the anecdotes, which are real and horrifying, or
should they accept the evidence that people are mostly happy with
their own insurance, happy to be paying less, and as healthy as
they have ever been? Both parties in the '98 campaign offer an easy
answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for voters is that neither answer is completely
right and neither is completely wrong.

PUBLISHERS KEEP SALES FIGURES A CLOSED BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that publishing is not a business but an art. Movie
executives are famous for knowing their box-office grosses, dollar
for dollar, the day after the movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   Not book executives. ``I'll call an editor and ask how a
client's book is selling, and he'll say 'Oh, gee, I don't know! Let
me check with inventory,'' an agent told me recently. ``But of
course, all inventory can tell you _ when inventory finally gets
back to the editor, three days later _ is how many books have been
ordered, not how many have been sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until much later (as much as a year later), after bookstores
have returned all their unsold copies, can publishers compile firm
sales figures. And even then, the numbers are not particularly
helpful. Did a book sell better in Topeka or San Diego? In the
spring or in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to answer those questions, but the book industry
doesn't seem all that interested in the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Bookscan, for instance, is a system made and marketed by
Soundscan, the company that brings you the music industry's
greatest-hits charts. Soundscan gets its numbers from a scanning
device installed at checkout counters at more than 85 percent of
all music outlets in America. Bookscan is trying to put a similar
gizmo into bookstores. So far, it hasn't caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Soundscan, which swept swiftly through the music business
after it was introduced, when Bookscan was unveiled last year, it
was dismissed by the American Association of Publishers, whose
official line on it was that it was too expensive. (Publishers
would have to pay Bookscan for the data.)
</P>
<P>
   Was that the real reason it was rejected? We don't know how much
Bookscan was charging, but wonder whether publishers really
factored in the savings they'd accrue from better-targeted
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   We asked around and came up with a few other theories of why
publishing is one of the last industries to seek the comfort of
hard numbers:
</P>
<P>
   1. Editors don't want to know exactly how well their books are
selling. It might force them to stop buying the kinds of books they
love publishing _ the serious books with limited sales.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary to this theory is that publishers don't want the
world to see how small the unit sales are for even world-famous
authors (they usually linger under 50,000) _ it might make the
whole industry seem a lot less glamorous.
</P>

   2. Hard sales data might eliminate a cash hoard publishers have
secured for themselves. It turns out that most contracts between
authors and publishers allow publishers to withhold as much of 40
percent of royalties against possible returns during the first year
of publication (and as much as 60 percent for paperbacks). Precise
point-of-sale data would obviate that clause, and force publishers
to fork over all royalties right away.
</P>
<P>
   3. The big chains have been quietly going into the business of
compiling book sales data themselves _ an obvious thing to do,
given their dominance of the retail market _ and don't want to give
up what amounts to a competitive advantage.

NO MEDICARE SCARE--YET

<P>
   Who'd have thought seniors would be clamoring to Congress,
``Please don't take my HMO away''? Only a year ago, politicians
were being castigated for ``herding the elderly into HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, as health maintenance organizations are suddenly
pulling out of dozens of Medicare markets, 400,000 elderly
customers are scrambling to find insurance coverage beyond the end
of the year and demanding that Congress do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Health policy debates tend to be eye-glazing, but there are two
reasons why casual observers should care about what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Medicare HMO program is a critical test case for
Clintonian ``Third Way'' thinking. Under policy changes passed last
year, Medicare has been transformed into an enormous voucher
system. It is the prototype of a still new and controversial idea:
</P>
<P>
   Government should finance a generous safety net, but competing,
private organizations should do the work. The government now
allocates to each senior in Medicare a fixed amount of money that
will buy coverage from either a private HMO or the traditional
government-run Medicare program _ thus fostering competition. If
HMOs refuse to participate, however, the whole reform plan is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Medicare savings are supposed to provide the major part
of the much-heralded deficit reduction projected for the next few
years _ $102 billion out of a total $127 billion from 1998 through
2002. And $50 billion of that is to come from savings expected in
the Medicare HMO program. If the HMO program fails, it will be an
economic as well as a social disaster.
</P>
<P>
   All signs, however, suggest that the immediate problems in the
program have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   More HMOs are seeking to enter Medicare markets than are seeking
to withdraw. The pullouts affect just 400,000 of 6 million Medicare
HMO customers. Industry observers and HMO officials say that only a
few more HMOs are expected to leave the program.
</P>
<P>
   What Medicare is now suffering is not a calamity. It is the
inevitable turbulence and messiness of introducing choice and
competition to a major social program. In a voucher system, seniors
have a choice of plans, but the plans have choices, too. They
aren't breaking any promises if they decide to take their ball and
go home. The benefits, however, may still be worth this downside.
After all, regulations failed to control Medicare's costs
adequately. The hope and the logic is that competing HMOs might
have better success.
</P>
<P>
   The real cause for concern is that HMOs may fail to control
costs in the long term. Over half of managed care plans are now
losing money, and a major shakeout is underway. After several years
of remarkable success, insurers are having serious trouble
controlling the costs generated by doctors like me, and not just
for the senior population. New drugs, diagnostics, and other
technologies have accelerated costs far beyond the pace of
inflation. Insurers are seeking double-digit increases in premiums
from employers, who will then cut health benefits, wages, or both.
The government will face intense pressure to raise Medicare HMO
payments in future years. Suddenly, the current budget surplus
looks short-lived indeed.
</P>
<P>
   If HMOs, like regulators in the 1980s, fail to tame health
costs, we will be left with an ugly choice. Do we let the new
technologies _ with their promise of a longer and better life _
consume ever more of the nation's wealth and productivity? Or do we
ration them? More than anything, the current HMO troubles are
evidence that this could be the major domestic policy debate of the
coming decade.

NIXON'S OVERCALCULATION THAT CAME TO HAUNT HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On Oct. 22, 1973, members of the House of
Representatives introduced 22 separate resolutions to begin
impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.
It was the Monday after the ``Saturday Night Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   President Richard Nixon wanted to get rid of the Watergate
special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, in the worst way. He did. That
night 25 Octobers ago, when Nixon's overcalculating excess of
cleverness imploded, echoes today in tension between presidents and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   As a news story, it was a stunner. As a precedent, it made every
special prosecutor safe, perhaps too safe. The rhetoric was more
florid then. President Clinton's fans say it is ``time to move
on.'' In October 1973, Nixon urged Americans ``to move from the
obsessions of the past and turn to the great challenges of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox was becoming an obsession,'' according to Nixon biographer
Stephen E. Ambrose, who cited Nixon's first political adviser,
Murray Chotiner: ``This guy Cox will use anything and everybody.''
The best account of that Saturday night is a 1977 book, ``Not Above
the Law'' by James Doyle, spokesman for the Watergate Special
Prosecution Force, which The Washington Post's Bob Woodward called
``probably the most leakproof agency in Washington.'' How times
change.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, former White House counsel John Dean pleaded guilty
to one count of conspiracy in exchange for immunity from Cox's
prosecution. Nixon said that night, ``the Watergate issue has taken
on overtones of a partisan political contest'' and promised
``decisive actions'' to avoid the ``anguish of further indecision
and litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox wanted to subpoena Nixon's tapes. Nixon stonewalled. When
Cox persisted, Nixon ordered the attorney general, Elliot
Richardson, to fire Cox. But Richardson had promised the Senate
during his confirmation hearings not to interfere with Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson resigned on principle, a rare public action. So did
the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus. Nixon and his top
aide, Alexander Haig, finally persuaded the solicitor general,
Robert Bork, to write a letter to Cox, saying ``I am, as instructed
by the president, discharging you, effective at once.''
</P>
<P>
   This melodrama unfolded early Saturday evening, which pleased
Nixon because his White House liked to dump bad news after early
deadlines for Sunday newspapers and after the network news shows
(no 24-hour cable channels then).
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after 8 p.m., at a Pennsylvania Avenue saloon, a
bartender whispered to me that something big, he wasn't sure what,
was up. I sprinted five blocks to the White House where Ron
Ziegler, the president's press secretary, was handing out the Bork
and Richardson letters at 8:23 p.m. Looking at my old Army field
jacket, not the usual dress code, Ziegler asked casually, ``Are we
on maneuvers?''
</P>
<P>
   No, this is the real thing, I replied, pointing to a CBS crew
and Neil Strawser interrupting the network's most popular show,
``All in the Family.'' Nixon had miscalculated the news and the
law. On NBC, John Chancellor began a special report saying, ``The
country tonight is in the midst of what may be the most serious
constitutional crisis in its history.'' The public reaction was
instant and negative. Haig later called it ``a firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   And we faced a deadline. Frank Grundstrom, the Globe's night
editor, made an instant, gutsy, movie-reel decision to rip up the
front page. In my office, as I banged out a story on a Royal manual
typewriter, a primitive pre-fax machine whirred the documents to
Boston, which Grundstrom printed in full on Page One.
</P>
<P>
   We made all editions, even the milk run to Vermont, where the
paper's top editor, Tom Winship, could say, with New England and
the nation, ``Holy cow!'' or words to that effect. It was an
incredible night in what Stephen Ambrose called ``that incredible
month.''

FARM ECONOMY PLAYS KEY ROLE IN ILLINOIS HOUSE RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.) 
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCK FALLS, Ill. _ Republican congressional candidate Mark Baker
starts his day on the campaign trail in this western Illinois
district along the Mississippi River with this mantra: ``It's the
farm economy, stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 39, a telegenic former TV news anchor challenging 16-year
Democratic veteran Rep. Lane Evans, recites this phrase each
morning to his driver as they set out for another day of visiting
the factories and farms that form the bookends of the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Baker's phrase is modeled from President
Clinton's successful 1992 campaign slogan of ``It's the economy,
stupid.'' Uttering his own version, Baker said, helps him focus on
issues that may spell the difference between victory and defeat
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that even in the midst of Middle East peace
negotiations and the White House sex scandal, economic issues with
local overtones reign supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the area's factory workers turn out tractors and
other kinds of agricultural machinery, Illinois' 17th congressional
district is a unique barometer of the nation's deteriorating farm
economy. Farm prices have slumped dramatically because of regional
flooding and drought, and an export market soured by the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One measure, corn prices, shows the slump: Corn now brings a
farmer $1.99 for a bushel but a year ago it brought $2.73 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to underestimate the downturn's impact on the
district's 12,500 farm that produce soybeans and corn in fields
that now are brown and flattened with the onset of colder weather.
Corn prices are at a 10-year low; soybeans at an 11-year low.
Over-all, farm income is down 81 percent compared to 1997,
according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   With farm equipment manufacturing intertwined with farm prices
and production, cracks are beginning to show in the district's
principle industrial zone, the neighboring cities of Rock Island
and Moline. Case Corporation in East Moline and Deere &AMP; Co. in
Moline have announced layoffs recently and many here worry that the
region's economy is a house of cards about to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   The farm economy emphasis also reminds Baker not to focus on the
House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation into
Clinton's role in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
The panel opens hearings next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for Congress to impeach a president,'' Baker
said last week between campaign stops in this small factory town
just 12 miles from Dixon, Ill., the hometown of GOP icon Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much noise, I've had to increase my discipline.
That's why I say `It's the farm economy, stupid' to myself
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baker-Evans contest is just one of the two dozen
battleground races where Republicans, Democrats and special
interests are pouring money and ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, a Baker victory would help them expand their
11-seat House majority and validate the GOP stand on education,
Social Security, managed care _ and impeachment. For Democrats, an
Evans victory would help blunt expected mid-year loses. And the
Democrats' remote chance of a November miracle _ recapture of the
House _ could never happen without an Evans' triumph.
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed liberal and champion of organized labor, Evans is
counting on union cash, shoe leather and votes to see him through
to victory. Organized labor accounts for about 20 percent of the
district's votes.
</P>
<P>
   Union political action committees have contributed $266,600 to
Evans' re-election bid. A small army of union volunteers and
Democratic activists from outside the area are working phone banks
and ringing doorbells to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a person who has never forgotten where he comes from,''
said Lonnie Stephenson, business manager of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 145. ``On the gut issues in
Washington, there's no question he's always been a supporter of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans' support of the labor agenda runs from backing boosts in
the minimum wage to opposing legislation against ``salting,'' where
union stalwarts get themselves hired at non-union plants in order
to organize from within.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO and the Sierra Club have run generic ads on managed
care and hog farm pollution _ another hot local issue _ with the
unspoken message that Evans is the preferred candidate for the
points of view conveyed by these messages.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 47, is being treated for Parkinson's Disease, a
neurological disorder, but he jogs three miles a day and insists
his health should not be a factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Evans first won election in 1982 at a time when the local
economy was reeling from recession. While he coasted easily to
re-election throughout the 1980s, his margin of victory has slipped
from 67 percent in 1990 to 52 percent in 1996, when Baker also ran
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans smell blood but Evans remains convinced he can pull
it out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at a wine-and-cheese fundraiser at a home in
Rock Island, Evans points to his firefighter father and nurse
mother as his role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saved peoples lives,'' he said. In Congress, ``I fight
for ordinary people and I identify with ordinary people. I think
there's something real in my ability to connect with working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's campaign also is well financed. According to Federal
Election Commission records, Baker had a war chest of $408,000 as
of Sept. 30, compared to Evans' $180,927. Baker took in $180,000
from business-related political action committees, including $9,750
from John Deere &AMP; Company, the tractor maker.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Baker's platform is garden-variety Republican
boilerplate, accusing Evans of being a tax-and-spend liberal who is
soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   But some of it puts a local twist on national issues. Baker
points out that Evans opposes both the North American Free Trade
Agreement and legislation that would give the president
``fast-track'' authority to negotiate trade agreements. Illinois
farmers and farm-related manufacturers need foreign markets to pull
out of the price tailspin, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baker understands farm problems,'' said Myron Stackhouse, a
Republican in rural Henry County who is a retired farmer. ``Lane
Evans has ignored agriculture almost completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's television ads seek to drive the wedge in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a farm crisis and it's hurting our whole
economy,'' an announcer intones as a huge harvester moves across a
flat field. ``Lane Evans is part of the problem.'' Evans quit the
House Agriculture Committee, another ad says. Baker ``wants to work
on the Agriculture Committee to fight for our family farms and our
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans supporters say their man is farm-minded, pointing to his
support of last week's budget agreement which included $6 billion
in relief for farmers. Evans also supports proposed USDA and EPA
pollution standards for treating waste from large industrial hog
farms. Such standards, his supporters say, would boost the
competitiveness of smaller hog farmers whose doghouse-sized
``hogdominiums'' dot the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' television ads knock Baker's interest in privatizing
Social Security and his opposition to raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   One theme that both camps avoid is Clinton and impeachment.
Evans blunted some of the potential for a Republican attack by
being one of 31 House Democrats to vote for the GOP impeachment
inquiry resolution earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has faded'' as an issue, Evans said.

FARM ECONOMY PLAYS KEY ROLE IN ILLINOIS HOUSE RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.) 
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCK FALLS, Ill. _ Republican congressional candidate Mark Baker
starts his day on the campaign trail in this western Illinois
district along the Mississippi River with this mantra: ``It's the
farm economy, stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 39, a telegenic former TV news anchor challenging 16-year
Democratic veteran Rep. Lane Evans, recites this phrase each
morning to his driver as they set out for another day of visiting
the factories and farms that form the bookends of the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Baker's phrase is modeled from President
Clinton's successful 1992 campaign slogan of ``It's the economy,
stupid.'' Uttering his own version, Baker said, helps him focus on
issues that may spell the difference between victory and defeat
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that even in the midst of Middle East peace
negotiations and the White House sex scandal, economic issues with
local overtones reign supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the area's factory workers turn out tractors and
other kinds of agricultural machinery, Illinois' 17th congressional
district is a unique barometer of the nation's deteriorating farm
economy. Farm prices have slumped dramatically because of regional
flooding and drought, and an export market soured by the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One measure, corn prices, shows the slump: Corn now brings a
farmer $1.99 for a bushel but a year ago it brought $2.73 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to underestimate the downturn's impact on the
district's 12,500 farm that produce soybeans and corn in fields
that now are brown and flattened with the onset of colder weather.
Corn prices are at a 10-year low; soybeans at an 11-year low.
Over-all, farm income is down 81 percent compared to 1997,
according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   With farm equipment manufacturing intertwined with farm prices
and production, cracks are beginning to show in the district's
principle industrial zone, the neighboring cities of Rock Island
and Moline. Case Corporation in East Moline and Deere &AMP; Co. in
Moline have announced layoffs recently and many here worry that the
region's economy is a house of cards about to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   The farm economy emphasis also reminds Baker not to focus on the
House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation into
Clinton's role in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
The panel opens hearings next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running for Congress to impeach a president,'' Baker
said last week between campaign stops in this small factory town
just 12 miles from Dixon, Ill., the hometown of GOP icon Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much noise, I've had to increase my discipline.

everyday.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last December, when Microsoft Corp. insisted that
the Windows 95 operating system wouldn't work without its Internet
browser, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided to
find out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a courtroom technician, the judge was able to
``uninstall'' his own Explorer Internet browser in about 90
seconds. With that, Jackson ordered the software giant to begin
selling Windows 95 separate from its browser.
</P>
<P>
   While that order was overturned on appeal _ leading eventually
to the new Justice Department suit against Microsoft based on the
Windows 98 software that began last Monday _ Jackson's dive into
the technical aspects of the case is indicative of his approach to
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom calls it like he sees it,'' says James Schaller, his
former law partner at Jackson &AMP; Campbell in Washington. ``That's
his signature. Most people respect him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 61, is is no newcomer to the national spotlight. The
burly white-haired judge was appointed to the bench in 1982 by
President Reagan. In 1991, he sent Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion
Barry to jail for cocaine possession. Three years later, he ordered
former Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to turn over sex-filled diary
entries to a Senate Ethics Committee. And last year, he fined
Reagan's former aide Michael Deaver $100,000 for lying about
lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Washington roots run deep. He grew up in the city's
affluent suburbs, attending the exclusive St. Alban's School. He
sang for the Washington Cathedral Choir.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Dartmouth College. Upon graduation, he joined the
U.S. Navy as a line officer, spending three years aboard a
destroyer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. He returned to Harvard
University Law School, graduating in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Jackson worked with his father, Thomas
Searing Jackson, a well-known Washington lawyer, at a predecessor
firm to Jackson &AMP; Campbell. The father of two grown daughters, he
loves sailing and spends weekends in St. Mary's County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways of the U.S. District Court, prosecutors and
defense attorneys say Jackson is an affable, able judge who runs a
tight ship. A former litigator, he's considerate of the time
pressures on overworked lawyers. Also, he's been known to show
compassion for those sentenced. One defense attorney recalls
Jackson using flexibility in sentencing a former military medic who
served in Panama. The reason: The man had served his country during
war without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson is not without critics. The gossipy
Washingtonian magazine lambasted him in 1996, calling him one of
Washington's worst judges. In 1995, the trade publication Legal
Times took him to task for moving slowly and calling long lunch
breaks. A 1993 Legal Times analysis, however, showed that his
reversal rate was about 18 percent. And former clerks describe the
judge as a warm, mentoring boss who takes a personal interest in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies he has a tough side. Jackson repeatedly has gone
head-to-head with Microsoft. Following the browser incident, he
threatened the company's lawyers with contempt sanctions because he
said they defamed a court-appointed expert, Lawrence Lessig. Lessig
is no longer serving as the court's special master in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Jackson is expected to show his signature
tenacity, digging deep into the technical merits of the case. He's
unlikely to stray beyond established law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fair,'' said Michael Volkov, an assistant U.S.
Attorney in Washington. ``But he'll enjoy a hard-fought trial.''

is no longer serving as the court's special master in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Jackson is expected to show his signature
tenacity, digging deep into the technical merits of the case. He's
unlikely to stray beyond established law.

Attorney in Washington. ``But he'll enjoy a hard-fought trial.''

PLAZA SCHEME REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bunker Hill, Schmunker Hill. Get ready for the Battle of City
Hall Plaza, round two.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate consulting arm of Ernst and Young, working with
the Boston architectural firm of Koetter Kim and Associates ``has
come up with something very exciting'' to break the impasse on the
plaza revitalization plan, says my man on the scene. (Koetter Kim
is known locally for the weird but fetching Codex building on Route
128 and for the master plan of MIT's University Park.) A previous
plan, promulgated this spring, was hooted down by the usual
self-interested constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details are still being worked out, but the design
will be shopped to relevant parties during the coming weeks. First,
it has to pass muster with Senator Edward Kennedy, partly because
he will have to shake the D.C. money tree to help pay for the plan,
and partly because it involves demolishing part of the federal
office building named after his late brother, the president. If
Teddy likes it, then a panel of experts selected by the Boston
Redevelopment Authority, the General Services Administration, the
mayor, and the Trust for City Hall Plaza would have to be duly
massaged.
</P>
<P>
   What do I know about the new scheme? Not too much. Dickie
Friedman's hotel is still integral to the plan. Yes, there would be
some green spaces and no, there is no cultural component, like
Yo-Yo Ma's proposed music garden. The dysfunctional City Hall
itself, much admired by the artytecture crowd as an homage to a
long-forgotten Le Corbusier monastery, would remain in place.

Improper Update
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good news and bad news emerges from the spunky little world of
the biweekly freebie, The Improper Bostonian.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the tabloid isn't losing buckets of money
for publisher Mark Semonian's family (read: his father Leon)
anymore. Semonian and others say the magazine lurches into the
black now and again, and could even be run at a profit. A friend of
mine suggests this might be a savvy time to sell the Improper,
although there's no evidence that this is about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news isn't really so bad. Semonian is still looking for
a ``chief editorial officer'' to replace Nancy Gaines, who helmed
the tab for three years. Unusually for Boston, he's actually
conducting a nationwide _ well, East Coast-wide _ search. No takers
as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, we learn that plans to replicate the Improper idea
in cities like San Francisco or Washington have never gotten off
the ground. At one time, Semonian even had a staffer exploring the
possibility of ``international editions'' in the Czech Republic and
Yugoslavia. Those fancies have since been reined in. ``Let's
conquer the block before we march off to Yugoslavia,'' Semonian now
says.

New Yorker stumbles
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the storied days of editor William Shawn, the New Yorker
employed a gaggle of Sarah Lawrence women who fact-checked the
magazine's prose with Pecksniffian punctiliousness. But whoever has
taken their place (Sarah Lawrence men?) has let whoppers into the
last two issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Talk of the Town reported that my former
colleague Patricia Smith ``made her first public comments'' about
leaving the Globe while reading her poem cycle ``Professional
Suicide'' at Club Passim in Cambridge. But as readers of the Globe,
the Wall Street Journal, and even the Austin American-Statesman
know, Patricia trashed us in a similar rap/slam/screed in Texas at
the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbingly, this week's unreadable, Seinfeldian double
issue about nothing informs us that doddering Viagranaut John Glenn
``was the first man to orbit the Earth.'' As they say in the
sitcoms, that would be Mr. Yuri Gagarin, of the country formerly
known as the USSR.

PUC RULES AGAINST PACIFIC BELL ON FEES FOR INTERNET SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California regulators have ordered the Pacific
Bell Telephone Co. to refund tens of millions of dollars to
competitors that help place calls over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-2 vote, the Public Utilities Commission on Thursday
declared that phone calls made over the Internet are local calls.
This means that Pacific Bell and the GTE Corp., which originate
calls made to Internet service providers, or ISPs, must pay
termination or interconnection fees to other phone companies that
process the calls at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Telecommunications Act, which deregulated the phone
industry, outlined this rule.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet phone calls are relatively a new option,
companies like Pacific Bell that provide local telephone service
play a role in connecting those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell has maintained that Internet calls aren't local in
nature and the it shouldn't have to pay termination or
interconnection fees. The company said once the call is transferred
from its system to an ISP network, the call should be considered
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Bell disagrees with the commission's vote,'' said
company spokesman Bill Mashek. ``We think the commission missed an
opportunity to fully study the ramifications of classifying the
jurisdiction of calls to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pacific Bell criticized the PUC's decision, competitors
rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important victory,'' said Cindy Schonhaut, a
spokeswoman for ICG Communications, an Englewood, Colo., carrier
that has an interconnection contract with Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no competitor is happier with the outcome than
Stockton-based Pac-West Telecom, which told the PUC that Pacific
Bell had stopped paying call-termination fees.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's ``rationale was that the calls weren't local
calls but that they were interstate calls,'' said Wally Griffin,
Pac-West's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said they're local telephone numbers and that's the way the
Telecom Act is written.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac-West, which has about 70 ISP clients, said Pacific Bell owes
it nearly $30 million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has not yet determined how much Pacific Bell owes
competitors or when the company would have to pay. And questions
arose over whether Pacific Bell's payments would result in higher
consumer phone bills.

(EDS: Repeating story of Oct. 22 to change name from John Glenn to
Neil Armstrong in penultimate graf) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started with that dorky icon of customer service, the
Time Life operator. In 1990 it surfaced on stage, clamped to
Madonna's noggin like some high-tech orthodontic headgear. Now, it
has infiltrated the very core of cool-dom: the Hollywood prop
house.
</P>
<P>
   It's ... the headset.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that liberating gizmo that allows the wearer to knit a
scarf, carve a turkey or juggle several small dogs while talking on
the phone has wheedled its way into everyday life. Look, Ma! No
hands!
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a major headset devotee,'' admits David Hale Smith, a
Dallas literary agent. Smith's headset comes with a very long cord
so he can pace the perimeter of his office while he converses.
``I'm like a dog on a leash. I sometimes forget that it's on and
walk down the hall to the men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   You can thank headset microphones for freeing all four of Janet
Jackson's nubile appendages during sweaty concert performances.
Sports agent Jerry Maguire (a k a Tom Cruise) nails the deal
wearing a sleek Plantronics number. And the wired sales staff at
Old Navy clothing stores can locate a size 12 in no time, thanks to
the futuristic walkie-talkies fastened to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun for the staff,'' says Old Navy spokeswoman Kirsten
Maynard. ``They look cool. They feel cool.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer confined to drive-through McStaffers and office
receptionists, the headset is destined to become the next
communication must-have. It's ergonomically correct, improves
productivity and looks soooo stylin', especially if you're a tough
cop (Kevin Spacey in ``The Negotiator''), free-lance assassin (John
Cusack in ``Grosse Point Blank'') or really hip soccer mom (no
sightings yet reported).
</P>
<P>
   Witness employees at cutting-edge restaurants sending and
receiving data from the kitchens. At health clubs, aerobics
instructors no longer have to worry about banging their teeth
against hand-held mics. Ouch. Headsets that attach to cell phones
that attach to belts provide the ultimate in mobility. No more of
that one-hand-on-the-steering-wheel thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding they want to do more with the time they
have,'' says Tom Benoit, marketing communications manager for
industry heavyweight Plantronics. ``I get home from work, I put my
headset on, and talk while I make dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest headsets slip around or in the ear, so as not to muss
up hairdos, which is key in Hollywood. Between 1995 and 1997,
Plantronics headsets took a supporting role in more than three
dozen television shows and movies, including ``Baywatch,'' ``Murphy
Brown,'' ``Fresh Prince,'' ``Friends,'' ``Con Air,'' ``Alien 2,''
``Godzilla,'' ``Men in Black'' and ``The Peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Headsets have portended the future ever since Neil Armstrong
voiced his most famous words through a Plantronics doohickey in
1969. Even so, they can still look dorky to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone walks in my office and they're not a headset
person,'' Smith says, ``you look like you're trying to be mission
control or something.''

SERIES WAS A LET-DOWN, BUT OH, WHAT A SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're fond of thrill-packed, edge-of-your-seat,
down-to-the-last-second sporting events, the World Series was a
flop: A four-game sweep in which the losing San Diego Padres barely
gave the victorious New York Yankees an anxious moment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as a demonstration of mind-boggling baseball
proficiency, the 1998 World Series was a work of art, a masterpiece
on dirt and grass created by the winningest franchise in the
history of America's most history-conscious sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were, to use an overused adjective, awesome. The
Padres needn't feel ashamed of their futility in the World Series;
they were run over by a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the best part of the whole deal wasn't the winners'
spectacular exhibition of hitting, pitching and fielding. The best
part was the grace and class exhibited by everyone connected with
the Yankees, from the cancer-stricken Darryl Strawberry to Most
Valuable Player Scott Brosius to manager Joe Torre to _ seriously,
folks _ owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even the notoriously obnoxious Steinbrenner was a model of
humility. How amazing it was to see the hard-boiled money man known
as ``Boss'' just plain turn into mush, so overwhelmed by his team's
success that he broke down and cried.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, an all-star player and a highly respected manager, had
never been in a World Series until the Yankees won the Fall Classic
two years ago. Now, he's won two world championships in three years
_ and remains as humble and polite as he was when he labored with
teams that lost more often than they won.
</P>
<P>
   I met Torre in 1971, the year he hit .363 for the St. Louis
Cardinals to win the National League batting championship. The
sports editor of the paper where I worked introduced me to Torre in
the Cardinals' clubhouse and let me sit in on a post-game
interview. Torre gave us all the time we wanted, graciously
answered every question and thanked us for visiting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked us. Can you imagine some of these overpaid prima
donnas who play baseball nowadays actually thanking a small-town
sportswriter and his tag-along assistant for delaying the player's
escape from the ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   If there were more Joe Torres in the game, I wouldn't be
boycotting baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   As regular readers are no doubt aware, I modified my boycott
this year so that I could watch baseball games on television _
which was lucky for me, since I never would have had the willpower
to resist sneaking a peek at the enthralling home-run derby staged
all summer and fall by Mark McGwire of the Cardinals and Sammy Sosa
of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   If I hadn't watched McGwire hit some of his 70 home runs, or
watched at least a few of Sosa's 66 homers, I'd have spent the rest
of my life wishing that I had.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the post-season, especially the World Series, that has
annually posed the greatest threat to my resolve. A few seasons
back, I fell off the boycott bandwagon early in the playoffs and
ended up watching darn near every inning of every game right
through the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball in the fall is just too hard to resist. The World
Series conjures up too many memories of autumn afternoons spent
rooting for bigger-than-life heroes such as Mickey Mantle, Whitey
Ford, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron...
</P>
<P>
   So I saved myself some grief by watching baseball on television
this year while still honoring my pledge to avoid in-person
attendance at games and to refrain from buying licensed products
that inflate the bankrolls of players and owners.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what I would have done if the World Series had been
contested at The Ballpark in Arlington. The temptation might have
been overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott was watered down but, in essence, it survived a
season that baseball bigwigs and sports pundits are calling the
greatest in the history of the sport. Baseball is back, they're
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But longtime baseball genius and onetime Texas Rangers
manager Whitey Herzog said recently that the jury is still out on
whether baseball has completely overcome its problems and
permanently repaired its relationship with disillusioned fans.
</P>
<P>
   Let's wait and see what happens next year, Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Good plan.

QUIT STALLING ON INSTALLATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have Win95 installed on my computer (32 MB of
RAM, 133 MHz). I want to know if it is safe to load Windows 98 and
if there could be any problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Upgrader
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UP: It's at least as safe as sticking your face into a fan,
maybe even more so. Listen, if you're looking for somebody to blow
smoke up your peripherals and guarantee that everything is going to
be swell, then go bother John C. Dvorak or Ann Landers or Miss
Manners or some other columnist who gets paid more than I do.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is not perfect (and I'm sure that's a real shocker).
Chances are it will install itself over 95 flawlessly, but your
computer might be one of the exceptions. I've been loading various
versions of Windows since right after Microsoft ``borrowed'' the
idea of a graphical interface, so I've seen my share of smoking
debris from aborted and ham-handedly botched installations. You'd
think I'd know what I was doing by now. Maybe not, because the
first time I tried to load 98, it turned into a two-day migraine.
While many will be quick to blame blood alcohol, I still say you
can't expect a perfect installation every time.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I recommend the upgrade unless you're really
satisfied with the way you're doing things now. Win98 is just a
tarted-up Windows 95, but it has too many improvements and
bug-fixes to ignore. Invite the geek from work to help you with the
installation, though. Remember, you should always have someone else
to blame if there's a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I love your new song. Can you send me your
autograph?
</P>
<P>
   _ Swedeheart
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SWEDE: You know, I was starting to wonder about all that
fan mail from Scandinavia until I realized there's a band out there
capitalizing on my global popularity. A quick trip to the Web shows
me that Dr. Bombay's ``Calcutta'' is No. 2 on Norway's Kanal 1
Drammen Topp 15 but is barely beating Depeche Mode at No. 17 on the
Sverige Top 100. What's wrong with you Swedes? Don't you recognize
good music?
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Here's a little gem that makes Microsoft
Access 97 the ultimate prognostication tool.
</P>
<P>
   Crank up Access, then select Blank Database from the opening
dialogue box. Name the database anything you want. When it opens,
go to the Macros tab and click on New to open the macro definition
window. Type in a space, then click the X button to close the
definition window. When prompted to save the macro, click the Yes
button, then name it ``Magic Eight Ball'' (without the quotes). Can
you see where this one is going yet?
</P>
<P>
   Now go to the View menu and pick Toolbars, then Customize. Click
the Macro Design checkbox on the Customization page, then close it.
Now you can drag the macro icon from the macro page up to the right
of the menu headings and drop it there, where it becomes _
abracadabra! _ an eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Magic Eight Ball your question and click on it to reveal
the wisdom of the ages. My question: ``Do Microsoft programmers
ever do anything but waste time on useless folderol?'' The answer:
``Very doubtful.'' Can't argue with that ...

INDIE SINGERS ONCE DIVIDED NOW `IN SAME BOAT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They both grew up around Boston. They both were ``The Next Big
Thing'' at a major record label, only to leave in frustration.
They're now both on the comeback trail with indie labels that view
them as artists, not commodities. They've both worked out their
cynicism and are on to brighter, more determined futures _ as seen
in the matching brilliance of their new albums.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Melissa Ferrick (from Ipswich, Mass.) and Juliana Hatfield
(from Duxbury, Mass.) have a lot in common. They once had a minor
feud when they were at the same label, Atlantic Records, in which
Ferrick dissed Hatfield somewhat jealously in a song that said
``Juliana Hatfield _ she gets 47 (radio playlist) adds before her
record even comes out.'' However, their shared mentor, Danny
Goldberg, president of Atlantic at the time, left the label and the
two women were left to flounder with replacements who had other
priorities such as Liz Phair, Jewel, and Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the same boat now,'' Hatfield says of herself and
Ferrick, who both have gigs tomorrow _ Hatfield at the Middle East
in Cambridge and Ferrick at the Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Each has worked hard to combat the cynicism that comes from
being an industry ``flavor of the month,'' then an industry
outcast. Hatfield has exorcised her demons in ``Bed,'' a crackling
new disc for Zoe, a rock label run by Cambridge's Rounder Records
and distributed by Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrick has given up a nagging drinking problem (``I'm in
recovery,'' she admits) to craft a high-energy, folk-rocking disc,
``Everything I Need,'' for Colorado's W.A.R.? Records. It features
a core band of Ferrick on guitar, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta (longtime
drummer for Sting), and guitarist Rob Laufer, who played on Fiona
Apple's last record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing with people who are way better than I am,''
Ferrick says modestly. ``And this album was so much fun to make.
This is the way you're supposed to make a record. What I do isn't
supposed to be heartbreaking and angst-ridden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrick's title track, ``Everything I Need,'' is a minimalist
manifesto about her guitar: ``Everything I need is right here in my
hands.'' It goes on to say that ``sometimes I'm convinced I'll
never write a hit song,'' but the irony is that the song is
starting to get radio airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to write more simple songs like that, the way that
Sheryl Crow does. But I haven't been too good at simple,'' adds
Ferrick, an acrobatic, fleet-fingered guitarist who attended
Berklee College of Music in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrick, who now lives in Los Angeles, will perform solo
tomorrow, because she admits that she can't afford a band. ``I'm 28
and I don't own anything and I barely make a living,'' she says.
But she's not a quitter. She often drives from city to city
herself, logging up to 700 miles a day. As she sings in one of her
new songs: ``I'm on my way to real.'' It shows in the music, which
moves from an Ani DiFranco-like intensity to slower, powerful
numbers like ``Stand Still,'' in which she sings: ``You can't tell
your heart how to feel/-You can only get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield might agree with that, for she certainly lets her heart
do the talking on ``Bed.'' She releases her anger at the music biz
in several tunes, among them the punky ``Down on Me.'' A key verse
is ``hookers and virgins, sluts and nuns _ what if I am neither
one?'' It's actually a commentary on the music biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that you can't be a complex individual. You have to
fit into a category,'' says Hatfield, who has been living in the
South End and is managed by Gary Smith of Fort Apache studio in
Cambridge. ``But it's not a bitter record. There is frustration,
but I came out of it with a much stronger belief in what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's borne out in such tunes as the Velvet
Underground-influenced ``Backseat'' (``It's such a long road, don't
let go,'' she sings) and in the acoustic ``Running Out,'' with the
line, ``I really don't know how to be the perfect girl/But in a
perfect world I'd give you what you need/-And you'd be giving me
another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hatfield's album rocks and rocks hard. She
also purged her frustrations in her much-improved guitar solos. ``I
think it's the end of something for me. I've gotten the heavy
guitars out of my system,'' she says. ``The next (record) I do may
be more pretty. It will still have strong guitars, but not as much
(guitar) feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't worry about it anymore,'' she says. ``I have the
confidence to relax now.''

POWER OF POETRY PACKS A WALLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the slam of steely cell block bars to the slam of language.
That's the arc of ``Slam,'' a film in which the convicts are real
and so is the poetry. And so, you would like to think, is the
likelihood of a young convict like the one played by Saul Williams
blasting free from deep despair and long survival odds and turning
his life around. In real life, Williams is a poet, but not just a
poet of the printed page. He's a champ at slamming, that
combination of poetry and rap in which feelings and experience
fuse, ignite, and fly.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's Raymond Joshua is a low-level drug dealer in a
Washington, D.C., housing project known as Dodge City, presumably
because sometimes you dodge the bullets there and sometimes you
don't. When his supplier and buddy is gunned down, he's embarrassed
to find himself arrested and sentenced for possession of marijuana.
Ray is not a killer, he's an artist, although he doesn't quite
realize he is. He doesn't have a lot of time to think about it,
focused as he is on simple survival, and aware that the so-called
justice system could easily chew him up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's strengths is that director Marc Levin has
spent much of his professional life as a documentarian with
experience photographing prison life. He knows the milieu and knows
as well the weight of hopelessness and danger that can hammer men
who already are down. Adding to the documentary feel is a nervous
camera style that emphasizes the jangly, provisional nature of life
inside and outside. Put that together with Williams's energies, and
``Slam'' has what it needs to push past the possibility of being
mired in liberal cliche about redemption through art.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's first eruption of poetry comes when he exchanges feelings
with a rapper in the next cell. Before long, he's in a prison yard,
defusing a violent confrontation with a voice that those who hear
it realize is speaking for them. The creative writing class into
which he wanders is made to feel real, too, by the compassion with
which the teacher played by Sonja Sohn relates to the men there.
She literally knows where they're coming from, came from there
herself. So did her late brother. A wry injection of additional
authenticity comes with a cameo by former D.C. mayor and convicted
drug user Marion Barry as a sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable achievement of this film is to vault over its
own unavoidably schematic good intentions, first by convincing us
that it isn't patronizing the men in the prison, nor treating them
as sociological abstractions, but as human beings. A check of the
screenwriting credits reveals the names of several poets, including
the leads. This accounts for the passion and conviction in their
ringing, soaring language. With the charismatic Williams and Sohn
leading the way, ``Slam'' electrifyingly moves beyond wishful
thinking to hot immediacy, and, yes, earned optimism.

PERFECTLY `PLEASANTVILLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' is one of the year's delights. It flies off
the screen with a freshness and wonder that tickle you with the
thought that film itself is being reborn, not just the characters
in Gary Ross's allegorical fairy tale. The device Ross uses as
springboard on behalf of passion and intensity _ and the
antinostalgic belief that you can't go back, only forward _ is
simply brilliant and brilliantly simple. A mysterious and
otherworldly TV repairman (Don Knotts) transports teenage twins
David and Jennifer from a broken home in the '90s to a
black-and-white '50s sitcom that Tobey Maguire's bro has idealized
into a comforting utopia of security.
</P>
<P>
   Having discovered it on cable, he sinks into reruns of the show
called ``Pleasantville'' as one sinks into a warm bath. Once
plunked into its white picket-fence nothingness, where the books in
the library all have blank pages, however, he and his slightly
wilder sister (Reese Witherspoon) find Pleasantville's steamrolling
blandness threatening to obliterate them. What begins as a riff on
``Back to the Future'' quickly turns into the flip side of ``The
Truman Show.'' In that film, Jim Carrey was a real character living
a made-up life, trying to break out. ``Pleasantville'' begins as
escapism, with the contemporary teens seeking refuge in a nostalgia
for something that never existed.
</P>
<P>
   But then the cosmetically perfect ``Pleasantville'' turns into
the Twilight Zone. Everybody is smiling and polite and emptyheaded.
People in Pleasantville know only what they've seen on the show.
The bathrooms have no toilets, nobody knows what sex is, and the
fire department knows only how to rescue cats, not put out fires.
As feelings and spontaneity and openness to new things lift
Pleasantville out of the rut it didn't know it was in, bits of
color begin appearing _ a rose turns red, a blade of grass turns
green, flesh tones arrive on the faces of teens picking up on the
'90s girl's introduction of sex. But not everybody embraces the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the forces of reaction, embodied by the town's
mayor, Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh, in his last screen role) make
their presence felt. Before long, conformity leads to mob hysteria.
Writer-director Ross obviously has a position here; he sees the
will to maintain the status quo as a losing proposition. The tight
little Ozzie &AMP; Harriet world of ``Pleasantville'' is exclusionary,
and as such, flies in the face of the view that life is change,
messy but necessary, a proposition disarmingly advanced when the
soda jerk played by Jeff Daniels not only starts making the burgers
before the french fries, but discovers the intoxicating world of
painting in color.
</P>
<P>
   Ross's digitizing and computer wizardry make the supercharged
color itself seem a character, in ways quite different from, say,
Wim Wenders's ``Wings of Desire.'' Not since ``Heavenly Creatures''
has color itself seemed so sensuous, so filled with gravitational
pull. To watch the eruptions of color in ``Pleasantville'' is to
relive the excitement generated by the gush of color in ``The
Wizard of Oz.'' It's not just color, it's color coming at us with a
newness and a vividness that are an integral part of the story that
makes its use so potent and joyous here. I never thought I could be
charmed by anything remotely resembling a pro-colorization message,
but ``Pleasantville'' is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Ross has Witherspoon's character find an appeal in
the emotional solidity and less-pressurized atmosphere of the '50s.
Maguire delivers one of the wisest, most centered teens put
onscreen this decade. In fact, the acting is so smooth and
accomplished that its skill and subtlety might go unnoticed.
William H. Macy brings poignancy to his opaque father figure who
doesn't know best, and the magnificent Joan Allen may finally win
the Oscar she long has deserved for her unquestioning housewife,
who begins by cooking dinner in wide silk gowns and pearls before
discovering just how sexy and passionate she is when the lid comes
off her emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The timeliness of ``Pleasantville,'' with its attack on the
fascist repression implicit in the stifling of impulse, only adds
to its appeal. So does the fact that Ross never succumbs to
ham-handed preachiness. If he implies that those '50s sitcoms were
designed to keep us stupid and perpetuate paternalistic control
over a population of unquestioning corporate drones, he also
acknowledges the seductive comforts of a defined social structure.
Most important, ``Pleasantville'' never takes on the disembodied
air of an abstract construct. Its impact is always visceral. Not
since the original ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' has an
anticonformist message been served up as a pop fable with such
style and lift.

THE GODFATHERS OF TECHNO ARE AT IT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's about a month ago, and Depeche Mode _ Martin Gore, David
Gahan, and Andy Fletcher _ are in England, on the eve of a sold-out
European tour. They've just completed what Gore calls ``the
penultimate production rehearsal, the lights are running, the video
footage is behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyboardist-guitarist-singer Gore, singer Gahan, synthist
Fletcher, and set designer Anton Corbijn are welding together the
music and machinery for Depeche Mode's live show '98.
Synchronization is everything. Visuals and staging are key
components for a band whose members, except for Gahan, tend to
anchor themselves at synthesizers. ``A visual aspect is quite
important,'' says Gore. ``I find it very bland to watch bands
proving that they can sound roughly like their records.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore admits to a bit of unease. ``We haven't done this in four
years and you start wondering how rusty you are and the whole thing
does seem a bit more nerve-wracking. Believe me, there are things
for us to worry about. But it's fallen together quite nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   As problems go, pre-tour jitters isn't a bad one. After all,
Gahan almost put an end to his life, to say nothing of the band,
when he overdosed in Los Angeles in 1996. He was arrested, went to
rehab, and is in recovery. He'll be attending 12-step meetings at
every city on the US tour, which begins Tuesday night at Worcester
Centrum Centre. (Depeche Mode decided not to tour behind last
year's ``Ultra'' album.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave's never been better,'' says Gore. ``He's very happy, and
he's been clean and sober two years which is ... well, time really
flies. I mean, it doesn't seem that long ago. He's fresh and
looking forward to the whole process. And me and Andy are trying to
learn from our past mistakes and take it a bit easier this time.''
Gahan's fall was, by far, the most public, but Gore says, ``We all
had our share of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   So the idea this time is to have fun, play well, and not mess
up?
</P>
<P>
   Gore laughs slightly. ``That is the game plan at the moment. The
only thing that frightens me, is I think that was our game plan
last time. We just can't let it get as out of control as it was
last time. You have a responsibility to those people who've gone
out and bought the tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   They are touring in support of ``The Singles: 1986-1998,'' a
21-track double-disc that omits the early hits (``Just Can't Get
Enough,'' etc.) penned by Vince Clarke (now of Erasure) and
includes the current new single, ``Only When I Lose Myself.'' Gore
is asked if there's anything odd about not touring behind a new
full album, but behind a best-of retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it won't be strange at all,'' he says. ``Really, it
means we'll be going into it far fresher than we ever have in the
past. When you make a studio album, you spend 15 months in the
studio, then you go straight into production rehearsals and then
out on tour. It's such a huge project to take on. Now, all we've
done this year is record a few tracks for a single, and we've taken
time off. We're all fresh and that's the best time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be something of a new mode for Depeche Mode. Synthist
Alan Wilder left the group in 1995 and Peter Gordeno is taking his
spot. Female gospel singers Jordan Bailey and Janet Cooke are along
once again. But for the first time, the group will employ an
Austrian drummer, Christian Eigner, who, Gore says, boasts that
he's ``the second best drummer in the world.'' He will play the
entire set. ``That immediately gives us a slightly different
sound,'' says Gore. ``I mean he's very good at reproducing the
sounds and triggering the original sounds quite a bit as well, but
I think there is a slight twist.
</P>
<P>
   Depeche Mode, in concert, is a different creature than Depeche
Mode, on record. ``Sometimes, I feel that our performances are at
odds with the records, but I think everyone who comes to the show
knows the records, and the show becomes more a celebration of what
the records are about. I don't think we could really capture the
moodiness of the records live. It becomes a totally different
ballgame, with people whistling along or whatever. But, at the same
time, I've always loved our live performances. Eighteen and a half
years down the line, we must be doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is Depeche Mode's main sonic architect. As high-tech and
electronic as the band has always been, Gore's approach to writing
is an old-fashioned one: Make sure the melody works on a bare-bones
level first. ``When I'm songrwriting,'' says Gore, ``I often just
start with an acoustic guitar or piano, just to work out the basic
chords and words, 'cause I always think it's important to make sure
the basis of the song is strong before you can move onto
electronics. You can often fool yourself that you've got a great
song, when really, you just got a few good sounds happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Depeche Mode, of course, is one of techno's many godfathers, and
Gore has mixed feelings about his spawn. ``As in all kinds of
music, there's good stuff and a lot of bad stuff,'' he says. Last
year, Depeche Mode was the recipient of a tribute album from techno
artists, where the melodies were largely stripped away in favor of
beats. ``I didn't like that particularly,'' says Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more of an inspiration to the techno crowd because of
the way we work and the instrumentation we use,'' he continues.
``We're one of the earlier electronics pioneers who used computers,
synthesizers, and sequencers. But that crowd, they're not into
songs, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took over the songwriting duties from Clarke years ago. His
songs work on pop terms but they're generally not the happiest,
whether the subject be romance, spirituality, or capitalism. Lust
and longing factor in as well. These compositions tend to be lush,
melancholic, full of questions. The new single, ``Only When I
Lose,'' is doing a slow climb up the charts. Tuesday night, Depeche
Mode will trip back through the past 12 years. ``Most of the set
will be the singles,'' Gore says. ``But we do play a couple of
songs that predate that, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the singles differ from the album tracks? Are they
written differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' says Gore, ``because I always just sit down and
write a collection of songs and then we try and work out which one
we feel would do best commercially as a single. I've hardly ever
written for a single (an exception being) the new track. It took me
a lot longer to write than it usually does. But we're very happy
with it. It's one of the most soulful things we've ever recorded.''

IT MAY BE TIME FOR SMALL STOCKS TO HIT IT BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big has been beautiful in the stock market for so long that many
keen observers are wondering if it isn't finally time for midsize
and smaller companies to get the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an issue for money managers who have done well
among the tall trees. Exhibit A: Fidelity Investments, which has
outperformed all others among the top 10 mutual fund companies over
the last 12 months, according to Kanon Bloch Carre in Boston. In
part, Fidelity did it by buying the biggest of the big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   So we took notice a week ago when former Magellan manager Peter
Lynch, the wise public face of Fidelity who cajoles Lily Tomlin and
Don Rickles to get with the investment program in national
television ads, pointed out the small stock thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the market that's been really badly hit has been small
companies,'' Bloomberg News quoted Lynch telling a San Francisco
audience on Oct. 16. ``That's the part of the market that has the
best value for me.''
</P>
<P>
   We raised the Lynch comments yesterday to the president of
Fidelity's investment management arm, Robert Pozen. He seemed a
little ticked at the question, to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fund does Peter Lynch run?'' Pozen asked. ``Peter Lynch
does not manage a fund and does not set policy for Fidelity. He
speaks as an informed individual. Peter does not represent the
Fidelity viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozen's point: that he has scores of managers and they can each
make their own decisions, within the limits of the investment
objectives of individual funds. The Fidelity viewpoint, as he put
it, is an amalgamation of manager stock selections.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't really matter how a collection of stocks come to
be owned by a family of mutual funds. They are there, in many
different portfolios. Even Pozen agrees, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in the aggregate, Fidelity funds have larger
holdings in big stocks than they did in 1996,'' he said. ``That has
turned out to be a smart move because those stocks have done well.
But it wasn't a policy decision at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   What Pozen really seemed worried about was Fidelity being tagged
with the label of a closet indexer, purchasing a portfolio that
looks a lot like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 while maintaining the
image of an active investment manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity officials said their typical stock fund had a weighted
median market capitalization below that of the S&AMP;P 500, ranging
from 10 percent to 50 percent less than the index in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity managers have piled into the very biggest of the
S&AMP;P 500 stocks, and those issues are an important factor in the
resurgance of the company's investment returns since 1996. Even
this year, the very big stocks are generating Fidelity's
performance advantage over its leading fund-company peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big ones, no question, that have been driving the
outperformance year to date,'' said James Lowell, editor of the
independent Fidelity Investor.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's funds have invested 36 percent of their equity money
in the 50 largest S&AMP;P 500 stocks as of June 30, according to
Technimetrics Inc. The percentage is roughly unchanged from a year
earlier. By our estimate, those 50 stocks represent about 28
percent of the value of the entire stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the performances among Fidelity's top 10
holdings, all members of the S&AMP;P 500's largest 50, and you will see
why they are a powerful performance engine.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, Citicorp (now named Citigroup), has lost money so far
this year. Eight of the 10 have outperformed the overall S&AMP;P 500
and two, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Microsoft Corp., have earned 70
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if the small- or mid-size stocks finally do have
their day soon?
</P>
<P>
   Pozen thinks he has nothing to worry about. Fidelity already
owns lots of small- and mid-capitalization stocks. The trick is to
own the best ones, as he said Fidelity has done in the day of the
big stocks.

   That's not only thanks to the relentlessly grim premise, which
has a cop doomed to the fires of hell for murdering his wife's
rapist in 1983, then returned to earth by the devil himself to
violently recapture 113 Hades escapees. The supernatural drama is
also burdened by a depressingly gray and moody look, and scripts
that are laced with some pretty heavy-handed religious parables.
The only lighter moments in the hour, which premieres tonight are
strained double-entendres to the tune of ``It beats burning in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Horton is best known for his years as the cuddly Gary on
``thirtysomething,'' but as Ezekiel Stone, the to-hell-and-back
hero on ``Brimstone,'' he is brooding and tormented. He is a cousin
to Anne Rice's world-weary undead, not human and yet
quintessentially human, wandering through nightscapes, taking lives
in service of evil. Call the show ``Interview With the Fugitive,''
as the immortal Ezekiel plays hide-and-seek with the authorities
and grieves for his wife, who is still alive somewhere, while he
tracks down his victims. The reason Ezekiel has agreed to re-kill
the 113 escapees from hell? The devil's making him do it, promising
him nothing less than a second chance at life if he can complete
the task. A grinning John Glover plays the mocking king of the way
down under.
</P>
<P>
   Each week on ``Brimstone,'' Ezekiel will go after a different
escapee. Tonight, he's on the cloven hooves of a priest who is
about to murder four children, and next week his target is a
college student who burns her lovers alive. The only way he can
send these demons back downstairs is by shooting out their eyes,
the windows to their soullessness. Conveniently, Ezekiel was a
celebrated homicide detective in New York before he became a
zombie, so he's got a way with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show's bleak goings-on could be cleverly amusing, if
the writers let go of their lofty themes and added a twist of wit
to the horror, in the manner of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
Murdering sinners and sending them back to eternal fire doesn't
need to be such a major deal, does it?

BLEAK BUT FUNNY LOOK AT THE SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the outrages and excesses that routinely surface as
straight news, what chance has a mere filmmaker in the current
landscape of shattered taboos? And yet Todd Solondz extends the
boundaries in ``Happiness,'' which you know going in will be
anything but. Broadening the canvas of his debut film, ``Welcome to
the Dollhouse,'' but keeping his gimlet eye trained on suburban New
Jersey, Solondz has crafted a comedy of lovelessness that is
astonishingly bleak and unsparing, even in an age of isolation and
alienation. It arises from a world view that finds life horrible
and funny at the same time. When its perversity isn't gut-punching
you, you'll yelp with laughter, convinced that gallows humor never
had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath its cool exterior, ``Happiness'' doesn't so much examine
its subjects as impale them. The more perverse and pathological the
character, the fuller and more inventive the writing. Solondz's
mocking reinvention of Chekhov's ``Three Sisters'' begins with
three grown sibs, each simmering in her own private hell, pretty
much left at the level of shrill caricature. Cynthia Stevenson's
brittle Trish pours so much energy into declaring she has
everything a wife and mom could want that you know she's trying to
convince herself more than her sisters and rivals. Lara Flynn
Boyle's jaggedly successful writer, Helen, is so famished for
emotional authenticity that she toys with an obscene phone caller.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Adams's masochistic waif, Joy, upon whom both shower
contempt thinly disguised as pity, lives in the house their parents
vacated when they moved to Florida. She writes wispy little songs
about her loneliness, but callously dumps an even bigger loser than
she is, who commits suicide. When nobody at the office where they
worked remembers him, she bursts into tears and falls for the line
of one of the immigrant students to whom she teaches English at an
adult education class, Jared Harris's Russian cabdriver, who
neglects to tell her he's married before he beds her and steals her
guitar and CD player.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, played by Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser, playing
out the tail end of a marriage that has turned to ashes, are
getting on each other's nerves in their Florida condo. But they're
just the opening acts. Solondz lavishes his most challenging
writing on the film's most threateningly deviant trio. You won't
soon forget Philip Seymour Hoffman's lonely nerd, Allen, who lives
down the hall from the writer and makes the obscene calls; or Dylan
Baker's bland-on-the-outside, seething-on-the-inside shrink, bored
by listening to Allen, given to fantasizing about mass murder when
he isn't drugging his young son's friends and sodomizing them
during sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Wildest of all is Camryn Manheim as Allen's hefty loner neighbor
who has designs on him, which he reciprocates until she tells him a
story involving their murdered doorman and a sex crime of which she
has inside knowledge. Of all the ways in which Solondz pushes the
envelope, the one certain to generate the most controversy is his
decision not to drum the pederast out of the human race. Instead of
demonizing him and killing him, he presents the character as
sympathetic to his own young son, played with a heartbreaking mix
of love and confusion by Rufus Read in one of the film's few tender
scenes. It's a rare film that would present a pederast at all, a
rarer one still that would present him as layered and complex as
Baker does.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you recoil from what you take as Solondz's misanthropy
or marvel at his ability to extract compassion from unlikely
places, you've got to admire his courage at confronting both the
unruliness of human desire and the widespread emotional shortfall
that plunges its characters into despair, even while generating
scatological humor as rudely funny as that in ``There's Something
About Mary.'' The acting is virtually flawless, with Hoffman,
Baker, and Manheim getting the best of it because they have more to
work with. ``Happiness'' is a devastating little hell-scape, but a
liberating one if you can suspend judgment and blast through to
recognition and understanding.

MORE WORKERS GOOFING OFF ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Kenneth Starr's long-awaited report to Congress was
released over the Internet last month, productivity at many
companies ground to a halt as employees logged on for a first-hand
look at the salacious details of President Clinton's sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By one widely reported estimate, the Friday afternoon diversion
cost American businesses nearly $500 million in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of cyberloafing by employees _ whether it's to read of
Clinton's affair, plan a vacation, or buy books on line _ is a
growing problem in the workplace as more and more people get hooked
up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real easy to get caught up looking at sports scores,''
said Kelly Haggerty, product marketing manager for Elron Software
Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which makes an Internet monitoring
program. ``All of a sudden an hour and a half has gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   As the US workplace goes deeper and deeper into cyberspace,
companies &UR;  &LR; are slowly waking up to the &UR;  &LR; troubles associated with
employee use of the Internet. Lost productivity is just the
beginning. New monitoring software and official policies on proper
Internet use can help control that problem. But companies also are
realizing that Internet abuse by employees can be a legal land mine
as well.
</P>
<P>
   A worker who downloads a pornographic image and leaves it on his
screen where co-workers can see it, for instance, puts his company
at risk of sexual harrassment charges by creating what the law
calls a ``hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, two high-ranking stock analysts at Salomon Smith
Barney Inc. were fired for sharing X-rated material on their office
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Misuse of the company's electronic mail system can also lead to
legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, black employees at Citicorp (now Citigroup) and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. sued their companies after
receiving e-mail at work that contained racist jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments last year fired nine employees and
disciplined 16 others for violating various company policies,
including misusing company e-mail and spending excessive amounts of
time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents have helped focus attention on the issue of
Internet abuse at work, and prompted many companies to establish
formal policies on the use of company e-mail and Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   About 54 percent of companies have adopted Internet policies, up
from 31 percent in April 1997, according to a nationwide survey
released in May by CIO Communications Inc. of Framingham, publisher
of CIO magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have gone further, investing in software from
firms like Elron that can monitor every click of the mouse by
employees, and can even block employees from accessing sites the
company deems inappropriate. According to CIO, slightly more than
half of the companies surveyed monitor their employees' use of the
Internet, but less than one-third actually block access to certain
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this new awareness, however, most companies haven't even
begun to think about all the ways their employees' on-line behavior
can hurt them, said Mary Calhoun, president of Calhoun Consulting
Group Inc. of Waltham, an expert on the issue of Internet-based
stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public corporations don't realize that employees have a
vehicle to speak that wasn't there 10 years ago,'' Calhoun said.
``We're in uncharted waters now, and companies simply have to get
with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their employer's sign-ons, workers might unwittingly _ or
even knowingly _ send a company's secrets out over the Internet,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Internet chat rooms and investor bulletin boards are full of
unauthorized messages from people whose identities can be easily
traced to the company they work for, said Calhoun, who uses such
examples to educate companies about the risks of loose remarks by
employees.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent sweep of one popular bulletin board, Silicon
Investor, for instance, Calhoun came across a message posted by an
engineer at 3Com Corp. that disclosed upcoming product launches. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He then used the forum to tout his company's stock. ``The stock
price will go up as soon as mutual funds and investors see what a
bargain 3Com is, at these prices,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, people would hype their company stock in the
local bar. Now, they're putting it in writing on the Internet, for
thousands to read,'' said Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   But such cheerleading by employees, even when it seems innocent
enough, can violate securities rules that govern the disclosure of
corporate information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes out of the guy in the mailroom's mouth, it's the
same thing as coming out of the CEO's mouth,'' said Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most corporations are absolutely blind to this,''
agreed Marty Gruhn, vice president of Internet business solutions
at Summit Strategies, a Boston-based technology consulting
firm. &UR;  &LR; ``There are a lot of serious issues about unauthorized
information going out from employees on the Internet, which on an
individual basis, appears to be innocuous, but which can be very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few cases aired publicly in Massachusetts, two
employees of Burk Technology Inc. of Littleton filed suit after
being fired for sending excessive &UR;  &LR; e-mail that contained nicknames
for the company president and references to an alleged affair he
was having with a coworker.
</P>
<P>
   The fired employees claimed an invasion of privacy and said the
boss's reading of their private e-mail, which was stored on backup
disks, violated the state's wiretapping statute.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlesex Superior Court in 1996 handed down a mixed verdict
that alerted many companies in Massachusetts to the need for a
clear policy on electronic communications.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the storage and review of e-mail messages was
within normal computer backup procedures for an employer, and
therefore, didn't violate the wiretap law. But it also found merit
in the invasion of privacy claim because Burk Technology did not
have a formal policy on electronic communications and had not
informed employes &UR;  &LR; that supervisors could read their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from such cases, said Nancy Shilepsky, an employment
attorney at Goulston &AMP; Storrs in Boston, is that ``there's no such
thing as private e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can look in on your screen at any time. As long as
employers are telling employees that, there's no right to
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other related issues, too.
</P>
<P>
   Employees downloading reams of material for personal use or
watching live video over the 'Net can choke a company's computer
network. Just as the water pressure in your home shower may
diminish when someone flushes the toilet, so does the company's
Internet bandwith shrink when employees tie it up with personal
business.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies considered such issues when they began rolling out
Internet access to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a ubiquitous business tool for many
companies, whose employees rely on the Web for everything from
simple research to on-line transactions with suppliers and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But employees who appear to be doing work at their computers are
sometimes using the Internet for other purposes, too.
</P>
<P>
   A study this summer by SurfWatch Software, a Web filtering
company based in Los Altos, Calif., found that 24 percent of the
on-line traffic at the companies surveyed was not work-related.
That's up from 18 percent in April. Sites most commonly visited
were general news, sex, investment, entertainment and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing a company can do to protect itself, attorneys
agree, is to adopt a clear policy on the use of company e-mail and
Internet accounts before giving employees access.
</P>
<P>
   But many employers are reluctant to crack down too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking to become the Internet police,'' said John
Wright, a technology manager at Stride Rite Corp., which uses
Elron's software to monitor Internet traffic by its employees. The
software simply provides a record that can be reviewed if problems
with worker productivity arise, said Janet dePiero, Stride Rite's
vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Maria Recalde, a partner at the Boston law firm of Burns &AMP;
Levinson LLP, warns companies against being too lenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult line to draw,'' she said. ``A lot of
companies want to give their employees some kind of break, to let
them send out e-mails or surf the Internet, especially people who
work late. But I'm against lenient policies because it's more
difficult to control. If you have a strict policy, it achieves two
results: the employees are less likely to abuse the system, and the
company minimizes the risk of invasion of privacy claims.'' &UR;  &LR;

REVIVED EVIL OF NAZISM SPREADS LIKE A VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When the evil afterlife of Nazism is the subject, special
effects are redundant.
</P>
<P>
   A sly gleam in the eye of Ian McKellen's old Nazi in ``Apt
Pupil'' and the blotterlike receptivity of Brad Renfro's naively
arrogant American teenager named Todd are all that's needed to
ensure a creepiness level that escalates with malignant power until
it's undermined by melodramatic contrivance and an overextended
ending. Wisely following the lead of his source, Stephen King,
director Bryan Singer keeps things in a mostly realistic framework,
making Nazism itself a character in this duet between Renfro's
smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened
Mephistopheles.
</P>
<P>
   The evil spreads like a virus, revived in the old Nazi's veins,
transmitted to the teenager who thinks he's got the upper hand
until he realizes that it's his own capacity for evil that's
calling the shots. After becoming obsessed with Nazism in a
Holocaust studies class, and poring over copies of documents and
photographs, he notices a resemblance between an old man on a bus
and a photograph of an SS officer named Kurt Dussander, who ran a
death camp. After dusting a mailbox for prints of the man who now
calls himself Arthur Denker, Todd confronts him with an ultimatum _
tell him what they're afraid to tell him in school or he'll bring
in the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   To watch McKelllen these days is to watch a supremely gifted
actor at the top of his form, often elevating material simply by
the way he wraps his talent around it. Certainly this is the case
as he begins by portraying the seedy old man as all but terminal,
nudged back to life by the boy's curiosity. If the boy is willing
to be seduced by Nazism, he's willing to play seducer. In a
chilling moment, the boy hands him an SS uniform, orders him to
wear it, and starts barking orders. As he executes them, the old
camp commandant in him surfaces while he goose-steps robotically
and ferociously.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the boy's power wallow turns ugly, with him and the old man
getting off on exercising life-and-death power over animals.
There's a catch when Todd finds his interest in girls and sports
diminished and his grades declining in the wake of his new
obsession. The only part of the film that can be called humorous
comes when the old man goes to Todd's school, posing as his
grandfather, and promises to help Todd get back on the academic
track, whereupon he turns into the homework Nazi, refusing to tell
Todd any more horror stories until he gets straight A's _ which he
does.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering
claustrophobia (most of the film takes place in the house of the
Nazi in hiding), ``Apt Pupil'' veers into melodramatic devices that
yank the film out of its disquieting amorality and turn it into
something much more ordinary and mundane. As a Nazi describing
atrocities with everyday matter-of-factness, McKellen is jolting.
As a hunted Nazi trying to avoid discovery and raising the stakes
when a homeless man tries to blackmail him after spotting him in
uniform, he and the film are much less interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Apt Pupil'' is most compelling for its moral
dimension. Unlike many so-called entertainments that merely exploit
Naziism by tapping into its gravitational pull _ still very much
alive after more than half a century _ this one makes the point
that Nazism is nothing to fool around with, that it will damage
you, especially if you approach it with little more than hubris, as
Todd does. It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to
arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion of the corruption
of the soul of either, only a fear of getting caught. That, and an
unsettling reminder that the Nazi virus is far from extinct.

US SPENDS MOST ON HEALTH CARE BUT PATIENTS REMAIN UNHAPPY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States spends far more on health care than any other
country, but a survey has found that Americans are just as unhappy
with their health system as are citizens of other developed
countries that have recently slashed spending.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Americans think the US health system needs rebuilding
from the ground up, for instance, compared with less than a quarter
of Canadians, who must often wait a year for a hip replacement or
months for a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives discontent in some countries are things like
waiting times, hospital bed supply, and the number of nurses,''
Karen Donelan, a Harvard School of Public Health researcher
involved in the survey said yesterday. ``In the US, what makes
people unhappy is still the affordability of care and the number of
people without insurance _ a bitter irony in a country that spends
so much more than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey illustrates the higher expectations that mark the US
health system. For instance, Americans have the world's
highest-paid doctors _ two to three times higher than other
developed nations _ and they are more likely than Britons,
Canadians, or Australians to report that their last physician visit
lasted longer than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Americans are also most likely to complain that their
doctor visits are too short.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Britons _ who are marking the 50th anniversary of
their National Health Service this year _ have the least generously
funded health system among major nations, are most likely to report
they waited more than four months for elective surgery, and are the
most likely to say their most recent doctor visit lasted less than
10 minutes. But only 14 percent of Britons said the system needs to
be rebuilt, less than half the US rate.
</P>
<P>
   The overall theme that emerged yesterday from a Washington
conference on international health care is that virtually all
developed countries are struggling to restrain costs _ and nobody
is happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US spends a great deal of money, but our health outcomes
are poor and patient satisfaction is low,'' observed Gerard F.
Anderson of Johns Hopkins University, who did a separate analysis
of health costs in 29 developed nations for the conference. ``When
you put these two studies together, you definitely see there is no
strong association between spending and outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Harvard survey, which polled 5,000 people in the United
States, Canada, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, found
widespread discontent over different aspects of health care.
Canadians, Britons, and New Zealanders were most concerned about
inadequate government funding of health care, while in Australia
the top problem was waiting lists for care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inability to afford care'' topped the list of citizen concerns
about the US health system. The United States remains unique ``in
not getting care to people who can't afford it,'' said Karen Davis,
president of the New York-based Commonwealth Fund, which sponsored
this week's meeting as the first in a five-year series on
international health systems.
</P>
<P>
   A number of analysts said piecemeal efforts in the United States
to reduce the number and proportion of people without health
insurance have failed. ``What is surprising to me is that we have
made so little progress in the last 30 years'' in reducing the
number of those without health insurance, Anderson said. ``It's
almost a flat line.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that new additions to the ranks of the insured
have been offset by steady erosion of jobs that provide health
coverage, said Harvard researcher Robert Blendon, who codirected
the five-nation survey. ``We keep adding increments, but they don't
keep up with the losses we're seeing in private workplace
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   In other nations in the survey, recent cost-cutting steps have
led to strong public backlash. Ten years ago, only one in 20
Canadians were so unhappy with their government-funded health
system that they said it should be completely revamped. The new
poll found that one in four now feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Canada spend half as much per person ($2,095) as
the United States ($4,090), but Canadians have reduced the
proportion of their gross domestic product devoted to health over
the past seven years, primarily by closing and downsizing
hospitals. Still, Canadian life expectancy at birth is 81.5 years
for women, 75.4 for men; in the United States, it is 79.4 for women
and 72.7 for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically froze hospital budgets all through the 1990s,''
David A. Dodge, Canada's deputy minister of health, said in an
interview. ``Hospitals have been the icons of medical care, so it's
not surprising that public confidence in the future of the system
has been weakened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge added that ``bad management of waiting lists'' has
aggravated the problem. ``The ordinary citizen frankly gets mad
when he has to wait a year or nine months for a hip replacement,''
he said.

``SOLDIER'' IS LITTLE MORE THAN DUMB GENRE STUFF?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' is little more than dumb genre stuff, dissipating
the promise implicit in a screenplay by ``Blade Runner'' and
``Unforgiven'' writer David Webb Peoples and an impressive physical
conditioning program undergone by Kurt Russell, its star. Russell
also furrows his brow and works hard to show the pain of realizing
that his humanity has been stolen. As it turns out, he needen't
have bothered. His character, a ripplingly muscled fighting machine
named Todd, is literally snatched from his cradle in a maternity
ward in 1996, presumably under martial law that permits the army to
hang I-A signs on the bassinets of robust-looking newborns and turn
them into human robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' then cuts to Russell some 40 years later as a
grizzled veteran with a lot of fight still in him. But he's
declared obsolete after the army develops a successor race of
genetically-engineered warriors. Who'd have thought that the film's
initial nightmare version of Plato's Republic would be presented as
an outmoded sentimental humanist approach to combat readiness? At
any rate, Todd is pulped by one of the new guys, a shaved-head
brute played by Jason Scott Lee. Left for dead, Todd is literally
dumped onto a garbage planet.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the film falls back, as so many futuristic
Westerns do, on production design and art direction. The junkyard
planet is fun to look at, especially after Todd is taken in by its
inhabitants, a pacifistic bunch of castaways who crash-landed there
on their way to a new life on a new moon. Todd doesn't talk much,
except to address everybody as ``Sir,'' including the women. His
strength and bravery come in handy, but it also scares the
survivors making the best of it in their shantytown built of junked
airplane parts and other pieces of scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner does ``Soldier'' raise the possibility of a
certain visual poetry arising from the junkpiles _ an aircraft
carrier lying on its side is particularly striking _ than the bad
guys who had dumped Todd there along with a space scow of garbage
decide, against literally astronomical odds, to conduct military
maneuvers on that very planet, among all the others in the galaxy
they might have chosen. Scarcely have the gentle settlers asked
Todd to leave than they're wanting him back again.
</P>
<P>
   And so he returns, dejected by the initial rejection, pain
breaking through the lid he had been conditioned to clamp on his
feelings. He had been puzzling his way through a mutual attraction
to the wife and mother of the family that had sheltered him. But
killing, not feeling, is what he does best, and when the soulless
replicants arrive and start trashing and torching the place, he
matter-of-factly goes off to kill them, turning what could have
been the usual moral ruminations of good sci-fi into a travesty of
a macho club sandwich _ ``Rambo,'' ``Death Wish'' and ``Dirty
Harry,'' in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be giving away any major story point to hint that
before it's all over Todd will shed his first tear and experience
his first hug _ and be a kinder, gentler killer for it. ``Soldier''
can make all the noise it likes about its focus on the humanity of
its protagonist, but ``Soldier'' is a sanctimonious kick-ass movie,
pure and simple, long before the inevitable return match between
Todd and Lee's heavy. Well, not so pure, but certainly simple _ and
filled with enough fireworks to justify a title change to ``Torch
Story.'' It's lively mindlessness, and visually operatic, but not
the fim it could have been.

SKI RESORTS ARE EXPANDING AND RENOVATING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the winter-vacation race, snow-focused resorts are getting a
run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans cool to summer's crowds, Europe in winter has never
looked more appealing. And the Asian economic slump has spawned
packages so low that it's almost a shame not to go.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a ski resort to do to compete? Expand, improve and
renovate.
</P>
<P>
   Terrain grows, instructional programs are tweaked, and old
chairlifts give way to high-speed successors.
</P>
<P>
   Take Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah. Long revered as one
of the most luxurious of ski resorts _ and that's ski, no
snowboarding allowed _ Deer Valley is investing more than $18
million in improvements for the winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrades and renovations include two new ski areas. Experienced
skiers will appreciate the terrain, some of the steepest found at
Deer Valley. One fixed-grip quad chairlift and one high-speed quad
chair will service 500 acres on the resort's fourth mountain,
Empire Canyon, that previously were accessible only via guided
Snowcat tours.
</P>
<P>
   Another 60 acres with a high-speed gondola and quad chairlift
will open as part of the resort's Deer Crest development.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley's enhancements will give it 18 lifts and 84 ski runs
plus six bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's new at other resorts in Utah and across North
America:
</P>
<P>
   Utah
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of the American Skiing Co., the Canyons
continues its transformation into a major winter-sports resort.
This season the resort will open Ninety-Nine 90 peak, where more
than 800 acres will be accessible by a high-speed detachable quad
chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyons also can boast of two more lifts (a triple chair and
another high-speed quad) and two surface lifts. For snowboarders,
the resort will offer Crazy Eddie's Playground, the largest terrain
park in Utah, and the Launch Pad, a halfpipe that is more than 425
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Readying for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games (along with the Deer
Valley and Snowbasin ski resorts), Park City Mountain Resort is
increasing its terrain by more than 3,000 acres this season. The
expansion, which includes a high-speed, six-passenger chairlift,
will give Park City 97 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has installed lights at its PayDay halfpipe to
enhance evening action for boarders and skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note in Utah: upgraded snow-making capabilities at Alta
Ski Area, expanded tubing terrain and a snowboard park at Brian
Head, four new lifts at Snowbasin, and a terrain park and halfpipe
at Snowbird.
</P>
<P>
   And Solitude has expanded its name to Solitude Mountain Resort
to reflect a winter-sports menu that includes downhill and
cross-country skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado
</P>
<P>
   It's new tricks for old _ and not-so-old _ dogs at Telluride.
The Telluride Ski &AMP; Golf Co. is debuting the Telluride Teaching
System based on the science of biomechanics and the efficient
movements performed by the best skiers. In this system, the wedge
is out; instructors instead will focus on simple movements combined
with proper body alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen/Snowmass will continue to attract crowds with its
commitment to snowboarders. This winter, shredders will find two
new halfpipes, a terrain park and ``ride guides'' _ skilled riders
who lead mountain tours to the best snowboarding terrain. Other
guides will be stationed at the halfpipes to offer snowboarding
tips.
</P>
<P>
   At Copper Mountain, two high-speed detachable chairlifts _ a
quad and a six-seater _ will cut the time it takes to get up the
mountain. And in January, expert freestyle snowboarders will be
able to test the resort's advanced terrain park designed by
professional snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, where good grooming has always counted, has beefed up its
Snowcat collection. Ditto for its sister resorts at Beaver Creek
and Breckenridge. The other Vail Resorts property, Keystone, will
get a lift with a high-speed quad.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve new trails and a high-speed quad chairlift will add
appeal to Pioneer Ridge at Steamboat Ski Resort.
</P>
<P>
   A new triple chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant await
guests at Aspen Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news from the Land of Enchantment is the marketing
partnership between Southwest Airlines and Ski New Mexico, which
includes Taos Ski Valley, Ski Santa Fe, Red River Ski Area, Angel
Fire Resort and Sandia Peak. For Houston skiers, it will offer the
opportunity to discover our neighbor's ski resorts at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the year to try well-regarded Taos, which has
increased its snow-making capabilities by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Angel Fire, skiers and snowboarders will find a high-speed
detachable quad chairlift ready to whisk them to the top of the
Back Basin. The lift will cut last year's 16-minute journey to five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes at Angel Fire include a Children's Ski and
Snowboard School complex, trails in the Back Basin and a terrain
park.
</P>
<P>
   California
</P>
<P>
   Could it be more heavenly? Sure, as two high-speed detachable
quads make lift lines shorter at Heavenly. Snowboarders and skiers
also will find more on-mountain dining options when
13,000-square-foot Mountain Lodge opens next to Sky Deck. And
families will appreciate the expanded Children's Center and a
day-care facility that accepts kids ages 6 months to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Northstar-at-Tahoe is adding night skiing and Snowcat tours that
take in 200 acres on the north side of Lookout Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-speed gondola known as the Gold Coast Funitel (from
the terms funicular and ``telepherique,'' as gondolas are called in
Switzerland) will move skiers at Squaw Valley, which also has added
a gondola and renovated its cable-car system.
</P>
<P>
   Also new in California: an upgraded lift system at Alpine
Meadows, a main lodge at Mount Rose, lifts and a $5.5 million lodge
with 15,000 square feet of sundeck at Sugar Bowl, a lift-served
tubing hill at Sierra at Tahoe, and a triple chair and longer name
at Boreal Mountain Playground.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky in Montana is reversing its downhill thinking with the
opening of its first uphill trail. Moose Tracks, which leads to
old-growth forest and meadows, has been developed for snowshoers.
</P>
<P>
   The resort also will celebrate its 25th anniversary with the
debut of a terrain park featuring a halfpipe and banked turns,
music and a rope-tow.
</P>
<P>
   At Whistler Resort in British Columbia, where the season on
Whistler and Blackcomb mountains begins Nov. 25, a $24 million
project includes construction of a detachable quad chair that will
reach the summit of Whistler Peak in four minutes and a remake of
the resort's Summit restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, enhancements include a high-speed quad chair in Lake
Louise Ski Resort's Larch area, a halfpipe for snowboarders on
Sunshine Village's Strawberry Face, and development of the American
Basin terrain at the Banff Mount Norquay resort.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, Tremblant is hoping guests will warm up to the heated
eight-passenger cabins on its high-speed gondola.
</P>
<P>
   At Attitash Bear Peak in New Hampshire, a high-speed quad and a
learning center await skiers.
</P>
<P>
   At Killington in Vermont, two high-speed detachable quad chairs
will replace older chairlifts. And 250 new snow-guns will be
blowing a storm of the white stuff when Mother Nature takes a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday River in Newry, Maine, will welcome skiers with a new
high-speed detachable quad.
</P>
<P>
   And while it doesn't sound as exciting as a new lift or lodge,
Sugarloaf/USA in Carrabassett Valley, Maine, has pumped more than
$1.6 million this season into grooming and snow-making equipment. &QL;

2002: A WINTER OLYMPICS ODYSSEY AWAITS VISITORS TO UTAH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ 1,209 days to go.
</P>
<P>
   It's countdown time in Utah. In just 40 months, 3,500 athletes
and 10,000 members of the media are going to come calling as Utah
hosts the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even take into account the estimated 10 billion
who will be watching events unfold from the comfort of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fret for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the state was awarded the Games in 1995, the work
had begun. Today, 80 percent of the Olympic facilities and venues
are already in use.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for vacationers, who can easily fulfill their
athletic fantasies by visiting and even joining in the action at
these venues.
</P>
<P>
   Start your Olympic tour where the Games will begin on Feb. 7,
2002. Salt Lake City is the site of the Olympic Village and host of
the opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Village, home to athletes and officials, will be on
the campus of the University of Utah. A renovated Rice Stadium is
expecting 50,000 spectators for popular opening and closing events.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Village, a 70-acre compound, also will be within the
Fort Douglas historic area.
</P>
<P>
   While the future village is not open to the public, you can
visit the Fort Douglas Military Museum, located adjacent to the
university. Fort Douglas historic area.
</P>
<P>
   While the future village is not open to the public, you can
visit the Fort Douglas Military Museum, located adjacent to the
university. Fort Douglas was established in 1862 and wasn't
de-activated until 1991. Stone buildings, dating to the 1870s,
still can be viewed and the fort's cemetery is the final resting
place of German, Italian and Japanese prisoners of war who died
here during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum retells the history of the fort, as well as the
military history of Utah. It is open Tuesday through Saturday, and
admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   All of the other venues are within a 60-minute drive of the
Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   West Valley City
</P>
<P>
   The new E Center in West Valley City will host the men's ice
hockey tournament. The 10,000-seat facility is home to the Utah
Grizzlies of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies, whose claim to fame is being the least penalized
team in the IHL for the past two seasons, began their season
earlier this month. The regular season continues through April.
Tickets start at $8.
</P>
<P>
   West Valley City is about 10 miles west of Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Kearns
</P>
<P>
   An outdoor oval track has been completed at this town, which
will host the long-track speed skating events. Plans call for
construction of a cover over the 400-meter track, which for the
Games will be known as the Oquirrh Park Oval. Work is to begin in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 25 minutes west of Salt Lake, this fast-growing
city got its start in the 1940s as a military base. There's not
much here for tourists right now.
</P>
<P>
   Provo
</P>
<P>
   The 8,000-seat Ice Sheet at Provo, which along with the E Center
will host Olympic hockey games, is under construction. Part of the
facility, however, will open for recreational skating in November.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Brigham Young University, Provo offers a few attractions
of interest to tourists. Most notable is Timpanogos Cave National
Monument. This is actually three connected limestone caves. Tours
of the caves are offered mid-May to mid-September, which means
winter visitors are out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Heber City
</P>
<P>
   Soldier Hollow will be the site of the Olympic Biathlon and
cross-country events. Eighteen medals, 16 days of competition and
11 different race formats and configurations are involved. Work on
the venue is to begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can try one of the more unusual experiences that
the Heber Valley has to offer. The lovely Homestead Resort, located
in Midway, offers winter packages that combine swimming, snorkeling
and scuba diving with traditional winter activities such as skiing
and snowmobiling.
</P>
<P>
   The water sports will be in the Homestead's Crater, a 65-foot
deep hot spring where the water is a soothing 96 degrees
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Stay for a night to have a swim and massage. Better yet, stay
for several days and explore some of the area's 100 miles of
groomed snowmobile trails. The resort also has a 12 kilometer
cross-country ski course and the hotel's formal restaurant is
famous locally for its Chateaubriand dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Park City
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by the Wasatch Mountains, the picture-perfect ski
town of Park City is the site of three major Olympic venues and
one-third of the medal events. Its appeal to the winter visitor is
its location just 36 miles from the Salt Lake City airport and its
average snowfall of more than 350 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Park City Mountain Resort will host the men's and women's giant
slalom alpine skiing events as well as all Olympic snowboarding
events. Deer Valley gets the slalom, alpine skiing and freestyle
competitions. The Utah Winter Sports Park, home of the luge and
bobsled competitions, was constructed in 1993 just to impress the
Olympic selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you want to just get a glimpse of the future or test
your sport mettle, the Utah Winter Sports Park is the place to
start your visit. Two of the park's ski jumps and the luge/bobsled
course are open to the adventurous public.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an intermediate-level skier, you can try the ski
jumps. Lessons cost $30 ($20 for youths) and include a two-hour
ski-jumping session. Most skiers can master the 18-meter jump after
their first lesson. With some practice, you can graduate to the
38-meter jump.
</P>
<P>
   You can use Alpine skis and boots for jumping, but you will need
a helmet that covers your ears. A rental helmet is included in the
cost of the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   If you like speed, consider testing the park's bobsled course,
where the Olympic athletes will be moving at about 80 miles per
hour down the 1,335-meter track. Your ride may reach speeds of up
to 75 miles per hour. This less-than-a-minute thrill will cost you
a $125 per person. Two can ride in the four-person bobsled, which
will come with a professional brakeman and driver. You also must be
at least 16 years old to try the bobsled.
</P>
<P>
   A less costly experience is the Ice Rocket ride. The Ice Rocket
is a one-person sled that is self-steering and self-braking. Speeds
reach up to 45 mph. The fee is a more reasonable $27 and includes
the use of a helmet. You must be at least 50 inches tall to ride
this rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not interested in donning skies or being a human
bullet, the Utah Winter Sports Park is fascinating. Tours are
offered several times each week. Call for practice dates and times
so that you can see young Olympic-wannabes hone their jumping
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the summer, freestyle jumpers are training here, using a
unique 750,000-gallon pool with an air bubble system that softens
the jumper's landing.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be constructed here are the 90-meter and 120-meter
jumps, which also have stadium seating.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dinner chargers are the large dishes that are
used under the dinner plate _ not the people who use credit cards
to pay for their meals.
</P>
<P>
   The decorative oversized plates, which can measure more than 11
inches in diameter, may be used beneath dinner plates year-round.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being decorative and festive, chargers insulate
the surface of your table from hot dinner plates. They are most
often used for formal dinners and luncheons.
</P>
<P>
   You don't eat directly off of the charger during a formal
dinner. (If made of china or silver, they can be used also as
buffet plates or serving platters.)
</P>
<P>
   When to remove the charger plate is a matter of personal
preference. Traditionally it was removed prior to the entree.
Today, it may be removed following the first or main course, but
usually before dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, which also are referred to as base, place, service or
presentation plates, act as a sort of placemat to protect table
linens and decorative or delicate placemats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, a charger was a large, usually wooden,
plate or dish on which a joint of meat was served and cut. The cut
meat was served on similar, but smaller wooden plates or dishes
called trenchers. Later, wooden chargers came pewter and
earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   Today, chargers come in various colors and finishes, some
ornamented with a decorative theme, such as the Christmas chargers
_ costing $15 to $25 each _ available at Pier I Imports. The
selection includes wood, ceramic, brass, gold, silver and bronze,
as well as blue, burgundy and green.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers can also be found in most housewares sections of
department stores and restaurant supply companies.
</P>
<P>
   A set of four 13-inch, gold-powdered/coated-matte finished
chargers from Lillian Vernon costs $30.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to buy actual chargers to go with your china or
everyday dishes. A set of oversize antique dinner plates, large
pewter or earthenware plates, will serve the same purpose.

<P>
   Its all rustic elegance and fine service at Deer Valley Resort,
where Olympic medals will be awarded in slalom, freestyle and
alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
   You can try your hand at Olympic-style skiing on the resort's
Know You Don't trail. The black-diamond run will be the site of the
men's and women's slalom races. The combined slalom events will be
on an Intermediate slope known as Big Stick.
</P>
<P>
   When you are through testing yourself on these runs, have a go
at the other 80 runs on Deer Valley's four peaks: Empire Summit,
Flagstaff Mountain, Bald Mountain and Bald Eagle Mountain. Expert
skiers can investigate the resort's six bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are out of luck at Deer Valley as snowboarding is banned
here.
</P>
<P>
   A full-day lift ticket at Deer Valley is $57. And save some cash
for food. Deer Valley dining is superb. Try the seafood buffet at
Snow Park Lodge or go gourmet at The Mariposa at Silver Lake Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Host of the flashy snowboarding events, as well as the men's and
women's giant slalom, Park City Mountain Resort is basking in its
Olympic role.
</P>
<P>
   This mountain resort is closely linked to the town that shares
its name.
</P>
<P>
   Park City boasts a rich history, and has grown from a mining
town populated with self-made millionaires into a hip playground.
Its historic district with more than 300 centuries-old structures
imbues Park City with a small-town flavor. Inside those buildings
are the restaurants, shops and galleries that satisfy the most
sophisticated tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating its 35th birthday this year, Park City Mountain
Resort offers snowboarders and skiers 97 trails and 650 acres of
open bowls to explore.
</P>
<P>
   A one-day lift ticket is $53.
</P>
<P>
   For an Olympic experience, try CB's trail, which will be the one
used for the giant slalom competitions in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest city in Utah also is the site of the Ice
Sheet at Ogden, venue of the Olympic curling competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Sheet is open most days for public skating. The fee is
$3.25 ($2.75 for children), and skate rentals are available.
Curling clinics for the public are held 11 a.m.-3 p.m. each
Thursday. The cost is $2, and you only need sneakers to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Weber State University, Ogden is a charming town with
enough attractions and activities to keep a visitor busy for days.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss Antelope Island, which at 26,000 acres is Utah's
largest state park. One of several islands in the Great Salt Lake,
it is connected to the mainland by a seven-mile causeway. While
hundreds of species of birds have been spotted in the park and
wildlife such as pronghorn antelope, badgers and bobcats are found
here, the park's main attraction is its bison. The beasts were
installed here in 1863 and a herd of 13 has grown to 600 strong.
</P>
<P>
   Also make time for two of the area's more unusual attractions:
Holy Trinity Abbey, where the monks sell homemade bread, honey and
peanut butter; and the Shooting Star Saloon, which opened in 1879
and now serves terrific burgers under the watchful eye of Buck, a
St. Bernard whose mounted head hangs on a saloon wall.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Snowbasin Ski Area, the runs have already been cut for
the Olympic Alpine ski events, including men's and women's downhill
and combined downhill.
</P>
<P>
   If you ski, you can re-create these premiere events via the Gold
Run, which is the men's downhill course, and the Silver Run, where
the women will be competing.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbasin has long been a favorite with the locals, who
appreciate its powder bowls and laid-back atmosphere. Extensive
renovations are in the works, including four new lifts for this
season. But you can still beat the crowds if you go before 2002. &QL;

POLL SHOWS SCHUMER GAINING ON D'AMATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARVY LIPMAN and JIM ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's lead in his re-election
race is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   The three-term Republican senator now leads his Democratic
challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer, by less than four percentage
points, according to a poll conducted this week for the Albany
Times Union and the Syracuse Newspapers by the Zogby International
polling firm. That spread is within the poll's margin of error,
making the race a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 703 New Yorkers who described themselves as likely
voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby poll one week earlier had D'Amato ahead by more than
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's vulnerability is best demonstrated by the response to
another question in the poll: Asked whether the senator deserves to
be re-elected or whether it's time for someone new, 46 percent said
it's time for someone new to be senator. Only 43 percent said
D'Amato should be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground Schumer has gained is among Jewish voters and
among those living in New York City's suburbs. The poll was
conducted Tuesday and Wednesday _ before a controversy erupted
Thursday over D'Amato's use of a Yiddish vulgarism to describe
Schumer, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Tuesday with Jewish leaders who support him,
D'Amato referred to his challenger as a ``putzhead.'' Translated
literally, putz means penis, although it is generally used to
describe someone as a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the incident became public, Schumer's lead among
Jewish voters was growing. The poll found they supported the
congressman by a 57 percent to 28 percent margin, up from 53-35 the
week before.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato has already launched a counter-offensive designed to
win back Jewish voters. His campaign Thursday announced new
accolades heaped upon the senator from Jewish groups _ including an
endorsement by the Jewish Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the senator's impeccable record on Jewish issues ... we
now come to declare our unequivocal support for a man who has stood
by our community through thick and thin,'' the Brooklyn weekly
declared. The endorsement, from the largest independent
Anglo-Jewish paper, hit the streets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hebrew Academy for Special Children renamed its
Woodmere, Long Island, building for D'Amato. The academy honored
the senator because he secured funding to build the rehabilitation
facility, used by some 280 children with developmental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting into Schumer's lead among Jewish voters could be
critical for D'Amato, who carried 40 percent of the Jewish vote in
1992, when he edged out Democrat Robert Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jonathan Rubenstein of Temple Sinai in Saratoga Springs
said this election offers a difficult choice for some Jews.
``They're both strong supporters of Israel and they're both
supportive of issues important to Jews. It's not as clear-cut as it
has been in the past between some of the contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato continues to lead in the New York City suburbs
(including Long Island, Westchester County and Rockland County),
normally one of his strongest areas, but by a shrinking percentage.
His margin fell from 55-30 to 46-40.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Schumer's campaign spokesman, said, ``As voters
in the suburbs learn more about Chuck Schumer's record and Al
D'Amato's record they are coming in droves to our side. Chuck
Schumer shares so many of the concerns of voters in suburbia and Al
D'Amato does not: good schools, lowering property taxes, getting
guns off our streets, putting cops on the beat ...''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato leads among upstate voters by a 48-29 margin, while
Schumer is ahead in New York City by a 54-32 margin.

 &HT;    Science is big part of Glenn's mission
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Oct. 25.)
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn isn't returning to space in spite of his age. He's
returning because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Science is a big part of the space shuttle Discovery mission.
Glenn will be the subject of nine experiments that scientists hope
will give them insights into why astronauts on space missions go
through certain physical changes that are similar to those people
on earth experience as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who served on the Senate Select Committee on Aging, began
noticing the similarities as he compared research data from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National
Institute on Aging. The more he looked into it, the more intrigued
he became, and the more it looked like a chance to do something
he'd wanted to do for more than three decades _ get back into
space.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, NASA and NIA decided to collaborate on
projects that included studying the effects of space flight on an
older person and how those effects might be related to the natural
aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn pressed forward with his desire to be the test subject.
NASA gave the senator from Ohio a sympathetic ear and then gave him
his wish _ he gets to go in space to be poked and examined for
science's sake.
</P>
<P>
   The first experiment is considered a ``payload experiment''
because of the amount of crew time, power and stowage space they
take. Glenn will not take part in the Melatonin clinical trial
because he doesn't meet part of the criteria for a test subject.
Neither NASA nor Glenn's office would be more specific, citing
medical privacy. The rest are called ``detailed supplementary
objectives,'' some of which are done on the ground before and after
the flight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protein Turnover During Space Flight. Protein production drops
off during space flight; so does muscle volume and strength.
Something similar happens to humans as they age. The loss of muscle
in astronauts was long thought to result from the lack of strenuous
exercise in a zero-gravity environment, but vigorous exercise
during space flight doesn't seem to prevent it. This experiment
will test a hypothesis that the loss might be stress related. Burn
patients experience similar muscle loss even when they are given
extra protein. Twice during the flight, Glenn and the shuttle's
rookie spaceman, Pedro Duque, will take two special amino acids,
the building blocks of protein. The first, alanine, they will
swallow in pill form. The second, histidine, they will inject. For
three days, they will periodically take blood and urine samples for
analysis. The amino acids carry a nonradioactive marker scientists
will use to trace their distribution in the samples. Scientists
will look for signs that the protein breakdown is caused by
increased levels of stress hormones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muscle and bone loss. In addition to the protein turnover
study, the astronauts will perform experiments to study changes in
bones loss, muscle mass and strength _ something else that often
afflicts people as they age. Measurements will be taken before and
after the flight to record losses and post-flight recovery. One
related experiment will also study deterioration and recovery of
spinal discs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cardiovascular response. An astronaut's heart and blood
vessels lose condition after extended periods in zero-g because
they do not have to pump blood against gravity. Also, heart rates
show little variation during space flight. Heart rhythm
disturbances have been noted in some crew members during flight.
The cardiovascular system is put under stress when re-entry
subjects the body to g-forces, and it has less ability to pump
blood up to the brain when an astronaut stands upright after
returning to earth. People may experience similar problems as they
age. Heart rates, heart rhythms and blood pressure will be
monitored before, during and after the mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Balance disorders . Astronauts in space lack the balance cues
we get from gravity, but their bodies adapt. Back on earth, they
may experience dizziness and have some trouble keeping their
balance until their bodies re-adapt. Balance disorder is also a
problem of aging.
</P>
<P>
   _ Effects on the immune system. The immune system is the body's
natural defense against diseases. Immune system functions are
suppressed on long space flights. One experiment will study white
blood cell function and reactivation of viruses before and after
space flight.

 &HT;    Decision to fly Glenn overrode Kennedy's
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Oct. 25.)
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The story goes that John F. Kennedy secretly
decided astronaut John Glenn _ who at the time was just a hot-shot
fighter pilot _ had become too famous from his first space flight
to be risked on a second rocket ride. So Glenn never flew in space
again.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 36 years later, after Glenn has filled out his resume
to include wealthy hotelier, venerable U.S. senator and, more to
the point, elderly grandfather, NASA's top administrator has
reversed the JFK choice.
</P>
<P>
   And for Dan Goldin, who has run NASA since the tail end of
George Bush's administration, that was the toughest part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States decided not to fly him
because he was a national hero,'' Goldin said. ``So, it was
uncomfortable in that sense because I was going to override what
President Kennedy had decided some 30 years ago. That was the only
discomfort I had.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why did Goldin do it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, originally Goldin confided that he didn't think he'd have
to. When Glenn, 77, hobbled into Goldin's office in the summer of
1996, Glenn's body stooped with the weight of medical books stacked
in his arms, Goldin listened intently to the scientific argument
for orbiting an elderly man and then set standards for approving
such a flight that he thought would end the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I didn't think he was going to pass the physicals,''
Goldin said. ``And secondly, I thought it would be awfully tough to
get some good peer-reviewed science.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin insisted that Glenn submit to a physical examination far
more intrusive than anything the average astronaut must endure, and
he added the caveat that Glenn could not fly with any medical
waivers, a rarely used method of permitting astronauts to maintain
their flight status when they develop a minor health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just like he went in and took a physical,'' Goldin
said. ``He took a whole series of tests...''
</P>
<P>
   And despite calling Glenn's first presentation about the
parallels between aging and prolonged space flight ``awesome,''
Goldin said he insisted Glenn get the backing of the National
Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was an uphill climb when I first spoke to him,''
Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldin says he wasn't trying to obstruct Glenn's return to
space. In fact, he is candid in saying that giving Glenn his
long-awaited second flight is half of the reason Glenn is going at
all. Goldin wanted Glenn to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have been the one to make the decision to send
him back,'' Goldin said. ``The easy thing to do is to say, `Hey,
we're not going to fly you. Go away, we don't want to deal with the
issue, the controversy.' I think (flying Glenn) is a statement that
we're a vital agency that's willing to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   As Goldin puts it, he wanted ``all the I's dotted and the T's
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   So over the course of two years, Glenn went through the physical
exams while simultaneously currying support in the scientific
community, driving the NIA to hold a pair of conferences on the
parallel effects of aging and space flight. And Goldin had two
other major requirements for approving Glenn's return to space.
First, Glenn had to promise he wouldn't ask President Clinton to
weigh in, and second Goldin wanted to call Glenn's wife, Annie, to
get her views.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what she said to me?'' Goldin said. ``'This is what
John wants to do. I've been with him 55 years. I'm going to support
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said he is still overwhelmed by her steadfastness.
``She's dead serious about it,'' Goldin said. ``She's supporting
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Goldin is willing to admit that inspiration is part
of why he agreed to let this elderly man reach his lifelong dream
of returning to space, he said he doesn't mind that Glenn refuses
to discuss such things. Glenn, called a hero for nearly all of his
adult life, has insisted on talking almost exclusively about the
scientific purpose behind his space flight, going so far as to chew
out reporters who have focused on the romantic adventure of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin likes the idea that Glenn is inspiring young and old, but
he won't ask him to talk about it unless he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not try and put words into other people's mouths. I will
not say a word to him about it,'' Goldin said. ``He has unique
characteristics. He has decided it is the science that's most
important and that's all that he wants to do. He really means it,
he is genuinely sincere. He is not gaming you. What you see is what
you get with John Glenn.''

 &HT;    Other experiments on shuttle flight
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Oct. 25.)
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn's aging studies will be just a small part of the
space shuttle mission. The space shuttle orbiter Discovery is
loaded with more than 80 experiments. The orbiter's 60-foot-long
payload bay will carry a battery of equipment and instruments, from
cockroaches to a satellite that will be turned loose for
free-flying observations of the sun. Here's a quick look at the
main experiments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spartan 201 is a 2,978-pound satellite designed to study the
sun. The orbiter's 50-foot robot arm is to lift the satellite out
of the payload bay and turn it loose on day four of the mission.
It's to be recovered on day 6. In the interim, the orbiter crew
will practice formation flying and rendezvous techniques.
</P>
<P>
   _ International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH-3) is a
batch of six astronomical instruments carried in Discovery's
payload bay. They're to be used for a range of experiments
including studies of stars, remnants of supernovae, and star
formation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hubble Space Telescope Optical Systems Test (HOST) involves a
variety of materials and equipment developed for the orbiting space
telescope. This mission will test them under actual space
conditions before they are installed in the telescope on a later
space shuttle mission, currently scheduled for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spacehab is a pressurized module in the payload bay. A tunnel
connects it to the orbiter's middeck. The 24,000-pound module is
packed with 30 smaller experiments ranging from materials science
to plant growth, to developing new techniques for delivering vital
anti-tumor medications.
</P>
<P>
   _ PANAMSAT is the Petite Amateur Naval Satellite, a Naval
Postgraduate School telecommunications experiment. The satellite is
to be turned loose on the second day of the mission. It will test
spread-spectrum transmissions, a hard-to-intercept signal that
downed pilots might someday use to radio their locations without
being caught.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cryogenic Thermal Storage Unit (CRYOTSU) is a batch of four
experiments that will test spacecraft cooling concepts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Electronic Nose (E-Nose) is an electronic device that will be
tested for its ability to monitor changes in Discovery's cabin air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Space Experiment Module 4 is a canister containing eight
experiments developed by elementary, junior high and high school
classes in the U.S. and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getaway Special Program. This is a collection of small,
self-contained experiments mounted in the orbiter's payload bay.
Among them is one to study the life cycles of cockroaches in
microgravity.

A HOST OF MINIATURE DAFFODILS, GOLDEN OR NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 25) 
(JT) 
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are only 171 named varieties of miniature daffodils, a
small number in the enormous world of 13,000 narcissus hybrids, any
one of which _ and billions are sold _ can safely be given sole
responsibility for trumpeting the arrival of spring. Big daffodils
make a big splash in the garden, but the miniature varieties hold
the corner on charm. These enchanting little flowers are the
darlings of every gardener who grows them.
</P>
<P>
   The miniatures are the toy poodles among daffodils, perfect tiny
representations of the big standards. They usually grow on short
stems, up to about eight inches tall, but some grow a foot tall and
flash their perfectly proportioned blooms right up under the chins
of standard daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   The genus Narcissus is split into 12 numbered divisions, based
broadly on the size of the trumpet (called the corona or the cup in
daffodil circles) and on the size and arrangement of the petals
(the perianth segments). Miniature daffodils may come from any
division, and there are minis registered in nearly every one. So
far, there are no miniatures in the split-corona division (11),
whose members have frilly, splayed trumpets, and none in the
late-blooming group of fragrant, snow-white daffodils with tiny
bright cups, the division known as the ``poets'' (9).
</P>
<P>
   Delia Bankhead grows nearly all of the available miniatures in
her one-acre garden in Hendersonville, N.C. Daffodil experts refer
earnestly to an affliction they call yellow fever, and Mrs.
Bankhead came down with a bad case about 25 years ago. ``It's the
collector's mania,'' she said recently. ``When you start collecting
a certain type of thing, then you want all the best of them.'' Mrs.
Bankhead is the chairwoman of the American Daffodil Society's
committee on miniatures, which maintains the official list of
miniature daffodils. She sells a few bulbs on the side, too. Her
catalog of miniatures, which usually lists about 50 varieties, is
mailed in May, and the bulbs sell out in two weeks, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great qualities of miniature daffodils is that of
grace,'' Mrs. Bankhead said. She particularly likes miniatures in
Divisions 5 and 6, both of which have wonderful swept-back petals.
``The way they hold themselves, the fly-back petals, the pendant
pose, they just look extremely graceful, like a tiny little ballet
dancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At most garden shops, miniature daffodils are up on the top
shelf, in bins not much bigger than a shoebox. The fist-size bulbs
in big wooden crates using up all the best display space are the
large yellow daffodils, usually Unsurpassable or Dutch Master,
though they're sometimes labeled ``King Alfred type'' out of
respect for the best-known but now retired monarch of yellow
trumpets. You have to be on your toes to spot the miniatures like
Hawera, Minnow and Tete-a-Tete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw miniature daffodils in a show, I was
fascinated that there were daffodils this small, and I started
looking for people with some for sale,'' said Mary Lou Gripshover,
who has grown daffodils for 30 years and has about 70 species and
varieties of miniature, including some of her own as-yet
unregistered seedlings, in her garden in Milford, Ohio. ``I started
doing a little bit of breeding, looking for something new and
different, something that looks really cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Three of Diamonds, pure white with an orange rim around the
cup, fits the description. It was introduced to the market in 1993
and is still hard to find and quite expensive ($25 a bulb from one
supplier), but as any real plant collector can tell you, $25 is
cheap for a plant you love.
</P>
<P>
   Many miniatures cost much less, however. Midget, Quince, Baby
Moon, Jumblie, W.P. Milner and other small daffodils can be had for
less than a dollar a bulb. For between $2 and $10 apiece,
blue-ribbon miniature daffodils like Segovia, Xit, and Yellow Xit
are simply indescribably sweet in the garden. Flower show judges
will be bowled over. At any price, Mrs. Gripshover's advice is:
plant lots. ``One bulb doesn't really do,'' she said. ``You need a
dozen or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the miniatures on the American Daffodil Society's list
were bred over half a century, beginning in 1929, by Alec Gray, a
prolific English hybridizer considered the dean of miniature
daffodils, and by an American, Roberta Watrous, now retired from
growing, who hybridized miniatures near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The society's miniature committee has added 29 daffodils to its
list in the last three years. ``In the last five or six years,
there has been a great resurgence of interest in breeding
miniatures, worldwide really, but the fruits are still to come,''
Mrs. Bankhead said. ``I know at least 10 American amateurs who are
actively breeding minis.'' Hybridizers in England, Australia and
New Zealand are working on them, too. The bulbs from Down Under
have to relearn the seasons before they bloom reliably in the
Northern Hemisphere's spring. It takes a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Plant these little jewels now, and place them where you can see
them, at the front of a flower bed, along a walk, near the front
porch. They sparkle among ground-cover plants. Plant them about
four inches deep, and water well after planting. Then stand back,
but not too far back.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like Ziegfeld making an inspection in size 6 Bottega
Veneta flats, Bette Midler paraded through the workrooms of a
set-construction studio on West 22d Street, stopping to glue a gold
paillette on a floral backdrop already blooming in sequins. Pleased
with the paint crew's progress, she wandered over to a worktable to
try on a pair of white feather, angel-wing opera gloves last seen
at a Victoria's Secret fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very Harlette-y,'' the singer said, referring to the
Harlettes, her famously tawdry backup group. Then she spotted some
foam spider costumes being built for an Eliot Feld ballet. She made
a mental note to call the choreographer. Perhaps the oversize
arachnids could be incorporated into her latest extravaganza, too.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a hubbub on a rainy afternoon, Ms. Midler was not
preparing for a concert tour in support of her latest album,
``Bathhouse Betty'' _ that's still months away. She was working on
another ambitious undertaking: the stage set for Hulaween II: The
Sequel, also known as the Makeover Ball. The evening, to be held
October 30, is a benefit for the New York Restoration Project, an
urban beautification group Ms. Midler founded in 1994. Determined
to outdo last year's Polynesian-style dinner-dance, which raised $1
million, Ms. Midler and her cohorts are transforming the ballroom
of the Waldorf-Astoria into a hellish version of Canyon Ranch
crossed with a batty Betty Ford Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it the Hootz Spa,'' Ms. Midler said. This year
guests who ante up $500 to $2,500 a plate will find themselves in a
cooler clime than last year's Big Island soiree _ somewhere between
Baden-Baden and Worsen-Worsen. ``We have the pampering, with a
horrible twist,'' Ms. Midler said. ``It's very sort of Northern,
Swiss, Austrian _ I hate to say German. It's kind of `The Island of
Dr. Morose.''' The expected 1,200 guests are being encouraged to
``come as you wish you were,'' to drink ``colla-gin and tonics''
and to feast on Dermabraised Chicken, Ebola Soup and Mad Cow Pies
with members of the Von Trapped Family Singers.
</P>
<P>
   Call it camp for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   A singer whose most enduring stage persona is that of a
disco-loving mermaid in a wheelchair, Ms. Midler has grafted the
flamboyant sensibility of her concerts onto what could have been a
staid, nature-lover's benefit. The Makeover Ball, like the first
Hulaween, may not be the largest fund-raiser, but it is one of the
quirkiest. Where else can Manhattan's greenest swells (swellest
greens?) bid on plastic surgery consultations, with Rosie O'Donnell
serving as auctioneer?
</P>
<P>
   Last year's luau-themed event, also held at the Waldorf, was
like prom night at Trader Vic's crossed with Honolulu's tourist-y
Kodak Hula Show. Ms. Midler, who grew up in Hawaii, performed not
only her hits but also her infamously ribald version of the
``Hawaiian War Chant,'' recorded on her 1977 album ``Live at
Last.'' As she erupted into song so did the stage. ``We were very
proud of our volcano,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Makeover Ball, her costume will likely be a kind of
vaudeville variation on nurse's whites. Last week, she visited
Parson-Meares Ltd., a costume shop on West 19th Street, where she
was fitted in a low-cut uniform with a short crinoline skirt and a
matching nurse's cap. ``People want me to come in a fat suit, but I
don't know if I want to go that far,'' Ms. Midler said.

   Ms. Midler has always pushed the boundaries of taste. Before her
movie success in such 1980s comedies as ``Ruthless People'' and
``Down and Out in Beverly Hills,'' she built her career on
outrageousness. She got her start playing to towel-clad gay men at
New York's Continental Baths in the '70s. In further camp displays,
she has emerged from a clam shell on national television and sung
``Lullaby of Broadway'' while perched in King Kong's hairy hand,
</P>
<P>
   The outlandish nature of Friday's Makeover Ball is pure Midler,
too. She chose the benefit's cosmetic theme because ``makeovers are
on everyone's minds these days, and it's so cheap and cheesy,'' she
said. ``I love it when the people being made over look better
before some crew got a hold of them.'' As for plastic surgery, Ms.
Midler said: ``People just love it. I think it's a scream.'' Asked
if she herself has gone under the knife, the actress turned coy.
``I had a wart removed,'' she said. ``I had an ingrown toenail
removed. I have a very dainty Caesarean scar ... ''
</P>
<P>
   She is ``conflicted'' about her own exotic features, she said,
quickly adding: ``Everyone in our society is conflicted. I've made
my peace with myself. I like stylishness way more than prettiness
anyway.'' On stage, however, Ms. Midler is always proclaiming her
beauty. ``I look good,'' was the refrain of her last concert tour.
``The limelight is very forgiving. The lights are really bright and
the audience is really far away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the Makeover Ball and her new album, Ms. Midler is
returning to her roots as an entertainer. ``Bathhouse Betty,'' her
first CD for Warner Brothers after decades with Atlantic, harks
back to her earliest recordings. She got the title when a drunken
fan outside her California beach house started shouting for
Bathhouse Betty to come out and play. ``He was loaded,'' she said.
``It was Laguna. You know how they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new label asked for a more eclectic CD than her last,
``Bette of Roses,'' a collection of romantic ballads released in
1995. ``I said: `You want variety? Well, stand back!''' Ms. Midler
recalled. The new CD includes a 1925 Hawaiian ditty and some light
rap amid songs written by such heartbreak heavyweights as Leonard
Cohen, Carole King and Ben Folds. Billboard magazine called the
aural smorgasbord ``a testament to Midler's immense talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased about the good reviews, Ms. Midler still
proudly calls herself the Queen of Trash. Her next movie is a
bio-pic about the potboiling author Jacqueline Susann. And she
considers her greatest achievement to be the work her Restoration
Project has done to spruce up New York, particularly the north side
of Fort Tryon park, above the Cloisters. A staff of 50 workers has
removed 2,000 tons of debris, including cars, refrigerators, and
2,000 tires from project sites in northern Manhattan and Long
Island. ``I cried when I saw it,'' she said. ``It's 4,000 percent
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Recreation Commissioner Henry Stern said, ``Ms. Midler
is doing in the '90s for the parks of northern Manhattan what was
done in the '70s for Central Park. . We think she's divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like Auntie Mame on a Martha Stewart bender, Ms. Midler
said her dream was to turn New York into a city as glorious with
greenery as Paris. ``Where are the Luxembourg Gardens?'' she asked.
``Where's L'Orangerie? Where's ours?''
</P>
<P>
   With manic zeal and a chunk of her own money, the adoptive
mother to several stretches of metro-area highway has been working
toward that goal since she, her husband Martin Von Hasselberg and
their daughter, Sophie, moved back from Los Angeles in 1994. Ms.
Midler, whose organization has raised $2.5 million for renewal
projects, said she has wanted to clean up the city for 26 years.
``I tried to do garbage in 1972,'' she said. ``I asked John Lindsay
and he turned me down because he thought I only wanted publicity.''
Her idea was to pay the city to put her logo on garbage trucks and
get others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Midler is not sure the war on garbage is winnable. But what
the heck. ``You just can't lie down and not put up a fight,'' she
said. ``Nature is the only place where you can gather yourself
again. It makes you human again. I actually believe that when
people are on a beautiful highway they feel better. I think they're
kinder to their fellow man.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So how's my favorite hair floozy?'' my friend
Jonathan asked, tweaking a hank of the two-foot-long blond ponytail
that lay across my shoulders like a particularly well-behaved
ferret. The floozy shrugged, and $4,000 worth of the finest Nordic
hair splayed across her back. I mean my back. But whose hair?
Because what was now shedding lightly on Jonathan's velvet couch
did not spring from my own head, and it was no Dynel pup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was real enough hair. It crackled when you brushed it
and gave off that fine electric-y, static-y smell. It even had
split ends. The ponytail, sewn into a webbed tube through which you
could thread your own mingy ponytail, had been lent to me by a kind
of hair couturier, an Argentinian-born hair stylist named Rodolfo
Valentin, whose specialty is wigs and falls and hair extensions.
</P>
<P>
   I was interested in Valentin and others like him because it
occurred to me that all of a sudden everyone was beginning to look
like the female leads of Merchant-Ivory films, rank with hair. It
seemed unlikely that fate had bestowed the gift of huge and
terrific hair on so many. I mean, people like Kate Winslet, Mariah
Carey, Elizabeth Hurley in those Dazzling perfume ads, beaming up
from under a castle of hair. And Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman,
looking like a pair of cocker spaniels in the movie ``Practical
Magic.'' And most runway models and virtually all the musicians,
male and female, on VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much hair out there, and so little of it belongs to
me, or to anyone I know. My own hair started falling out in chunks
two years ago; I cut the remaining three hairs as short as a boy's.
And so I have serious, crippling hair envy. I yearned to be big
with hair, heavy with hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I had four hairs or something after I had my first
child,'' said Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure magazine,
trying to be consoling. ``So, I would wear this fall. I just stuck
it in my drawer during the day and wore it at night if I had to do
something big. It's not glamorous, but I think the reason fake hair
is so popular is that nobody has any hair of their own anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan has been taking Propecia, the antibaldness pill. Rather
wistfully, he said that he was hoping, ``you know, to soon have a
few more hairs on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   As movie hair and runway hair become more and more baroque,
conjuring up a world of Liliths and Medusas, the rest of us huddle
together, a bedraggled crew of limp, wan Samsons.
</P>
<P>
   And so I set out to see what, if anything, I could do to join
the follicly gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put anything on your head,'' claimed Lisa Mitchell, a
talented young hair stylist who does a lot of runway work _ most
famously for John Galliano, Chanel and Comme des Garcons _ and who
is perhaps the most celebrated hair weaver on both coasts. She
could sew kittens in your hair and make them look as if they
belonged there. When Galliano had platinum blond dreadlocks, it was
Ms. Mitchell who fashioned them.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Mitchell and Valentin, the maker of my ponytail, have
in common is the way they augment real hair with real hair. They
work like sculptors or weavers or florists, tucking and gluing and
sewing hair onto hair _ planting lush crops in fallow fields.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin has a hair salon nestled deep in the Five Towns, that
part of Long Island where big hair really counts and money and time
are more plentiful than some other places. Valentin also makes
pieces for other stylists to use on their clients. Stephen Knoll,
for example, whose salon is on Madison Avenue, orders Rodolfo hair
for Blaine Trump and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Audrey Sanders, a clinical psychologist with a great sweep
of red hair tied loosely in a ponytail, travels two hours every
week so that Valentin can set her hair and tweak her hairpieces,
which include the ponytail and a few falls, about $5,000 worth of
hair. ``People always ask me, `Is that yours?''' she said, patting
her hair while sitting in Valentin's salon, ``and I always say yes,
because of course it's mine. I paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, whose prices range from $350 for a banana clip with
cascades of curls attached to $4,000 for a long ponytail, buys hair
from around the world from a network of distributors who collect it
from women called donors _ that is, the women sell it. Seated in
his salon chair, which is set on a platform high above the rest of
his salon in Cedarhurst, N.Y., I felt like Cindy Sherman slamming
through her characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very Chanel, I think,'' said Valentin, courtly and
deft, sliding on a black velvet headband hung with hair. Really, it
was very Hillary. The changes were swift and dramatic. A half-moon
piece was a fall of tousled hair that transformed me into an aging
ingenue. The long blond ponytail was strangely appealing, even
though it made me look like a refugee from a Carl Hiaasen novel,
or, as Jonathan said later, as if my name should be Bambi or
Trixie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The hair was smooth and coiled nicely around my hand, very
friendly and cozy. I wondered who my ``donor'' was, and I imagined
her, what? Tending sheep? Milking a cow? Enacting some
late-20th-century version of ``The Gift of the Magi''? Valentin
explained that hairpieces are created with many different strands
of hair from many donors, and I began to think of an entire village
commingling on my head. I worried about Middle European economies,
and I worried about Kosovo, and I thought, lamely, that perhaps I
was doing my part for global relief _ like buying renewable
rain-forest products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair is a crop,'' said Gary Herbert, a manager at the Adorable
Hair-Do Corporation, a company on West 24th Street that sells other
people's hair. ``Whole families grow their hair and cultivate it.
It's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In this hair world, if Rodolfo Valentin is couture, then
Adorable is ready-to-wear. At Adorable, a half-pound of dark hair
starts at $150; blond hair can cost as much as $1,000. Cardboard
boxes with hair spilling out line the walls, the floors, the
tables. Seamstresses sew rows and rows of hair into wefts _ hair
that's been hemmed like a fringe.
</P>
<P>
   A promotions director for a television network recently bought a
half-pound of wefted hair from Adorable, as she does every couple
of months, and took it to Ms. Mitchell's salon on Rivington Street
on the Lower East Side, where it lay curled up in the client's lap
like a sleek black kitten. ``Most people think this is my real
hair,'' the woman said, insisting on anonymity. ``So, let's not
mention any names.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell neatly cornrowed the woman's own hair, then picked
up the edge of the weft and began to sew it directly onto the
cornrows. I worried my own little homunculus of a ponytail between
my fingers (it had seemed gauche to bring Rodolfo hair into Ms.
Mitchell's salon), feeling inadequate and envious, as the weft
began to coil and creep up the woman's scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, she had morphed into Meredith Brooks, and Ms.
Mitchell began styling and cutting her shoulder-length hair _ it
was HER hair now _ into something a little more chic.
</P>
<P>
   My jaw had hit the floor an hour earlier, when the weft was
halfway in place and the salon began to fill with beautiful young
women, all with long woven-in hair. Gail Powell, the salon's
manager, had hers all wavy and wild; Amoy Pitters, a stylist, had
T-square bangs and straight, straight hair that fell below her
shoulders. Another client had chunky, poufy high-style hair. It
felt terrific. You could tug on it, drag your fingers through it,
stroke it, pat it.
</P>
<P>
   A full weave is about $1,500 and takes about seven hours to
create. It will last about two months, or until your own hair
begins to grow out. ``If you can't achieve it, weave it!'' Ms.
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I wanted to. Those women were so lovely, the Medusas of
Rivington Street. But I don't think I could. Hair _ sheaves of
human tissue, bundles of human cells _ is just too biological.
Wearing another's (or many, many other's) is a bit like stepping
into the proverbial dead man's clothes, with all the attendant
heebie-jeebies.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the possible boost I might give to Third World
economies, I don't really have the stomach for such intimacies. The
Rodolfo ponytail spent only a week with me. I took it for walks,
and out to dinner, and for extended shopping trips along Fifth
Aveneue. It swung rather crazily down my back but garnered nary a
wink nor smile from passers-by. In the end, I found I couldn't
dress for it. It lay curled on my dresser at night, an elegant
totem from a more elegant age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare/And beauty draws us
with a single hair,'' Alexander Pope wrote in ``The Rape of the
Lock,'' a zingy 18th-century social satire that equates a snipped
hair with loss of virtue. Virtue is gone forever. Hair, it seems,
is not.

 &HT;    'WAITRESS MOMS' A TARGET GROUP IN FALL ELECTIONS
 &HT;    630&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ At first, Robyn Boggs scoffed at the suggestion
that she _ and the millions of American women like her _ are the
most sought-after prize in this year's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding,'' she said, busily tending the bar
and lunch tables during the noon rush at Red Hot and Blue, a
popular barbecue restaurant in this suburb some 20 miles west of
Capitol Hill. ``That sure says a lot about politics today,'' she
quips.
</P>
<P>
   But Celinda Lake, a leading pollster and strategist in the
Democratic Party, is not kidding. ``It's the waitress moms, not the
soccer moms, who will decide this election, if they vote,'' Lake
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's a big ``if.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs is a ``waitress mom,'' one of up to 25 million women
voters in America who roughly fit Lake's profile: white, a high
school graduate or less, under 55 years of age, married with a
child at home, and living in the suburbs or a rural area. Many are
working two low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms,'' political shorthand for white suburban Baby
Boomer career women with families, were the rage of the 1996
presidential campaign as strategists and the news media tried to
explain why white women and men took such divergent electoral
routes. A majority of women supported President Clinton's
re-election, while a majority of men backed his Republican
challenger, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Some polling experts question whether ``waitress moms'' are
anything more than a minor voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cute phrase, but it explains little,'' said Jack
Pitney, a former Republican National Committee official who now
teaches political science at Claremont McKenna College in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of detail in electorial subgroups is probably
overdone,'' agreed Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan
professor of political science who specializes in polling.
</P>
<P>
   But such labels are a bit more meaningful in off-year elections,
when turnout is lower and both parties go to great lengths to
identify and turn out their core supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 5 million fewer ``soccer mom'' voters than
``waitress mom'' voters, Census Bureau data indicate. While they
occasionally swing in the Democrats' direction, ``soccer moms''
largely lean Republican. And this fall, Democrats calculate, this
bloc's anger at Clinton's sexual conduct will put them in the GOP
column in some of the closer congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waitress moms'' are just as incensed at Clinton's conduct. But
they are not as fickle. They tend to vote Democratic _ when they
bother to vote. And with the election less than two weeks away,
Lake is worried that the ``waitress moms'' are going to stay home,
giving the Republican Party an even greater opportunity to add to
its majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not sure they'll turn out,'' Lake said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure they do, Democrats at every level are emphasizing
issues of importance to women, and especially to ``waitress moms'':
education, health care, and retirement security.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has done its part. Hardly a day has passed in
the last month that the president or First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton has not been involved in some event aimed at promoting one
of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   And next Tuesday, exactly one week before the election, Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and a handful of women will participate in a
White House round-table discussion of how important Social Security
is to women in low-paying jobs who often find it difficult to save
for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The event, during which the president is expected to propose new
laws expanding women's access to private retirement savings plans,
will be beamed via satellite to audiences of women around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One woman who won't have time to watch is Boggs. She'll be
working her busy shift at Red Hot and Blue.
</P>
<P>
   She works five shifts a week at the restaurant, and also works
at a small roadside country store she bought in 1992. It's in
Culpepper, Va., 45 miles west of Fairfax. And when she's not here
or there, she's home with her 7-year-old son Gary and husband,
Mike, a glass repairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have a lot of extra time,'' she said. ``And
sometimes, when I look at how much I'm working and how little I'm
making, I wonder if it's all worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs is 40, a high school graduate, originally from New Jersey.
She's a lifelong but independent-minded Democrat married to a
Democrat-turned-Republican. They're buying their home, and plan to
refinance in order to take advantage of lower interest rates and to
pay off credit card debts totaling $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   She voted for Ross Perot for president in 1992 and for Clinton
in 1996. Clinton won her over because ``he's more of a blue-collar
president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation turned to Clinton's extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, she said, ``He's a
slimeball. But he's a good president. He understands working
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs did not bother to vote in 1994, the first off-year
election of Clinton's presidency and the one in which the
Republican Party regained a majority of the U.S. Senate and ended
the Democratic Party's 40-year control of the U.S. House of
Representatives. Among the Republicans elected to the House that
year on Speaker Newt Gingrich's ``Contract With America'' platform
was Tom Davis, replacing a Democrat to represent the district in
which Boggs lives.
</P>
<P>
   It is such a dropoff in voting from presidential to
congressional elections that is the Democratic Party's biggest
headache in this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 60 million women turned out at the polls. Two years
later, that fell to 45 million, with ``non-college'' women, mostly
Democrats, accounting for 13.8 million of the 15 million drop,
according to EMILY's List, an organization that promotes the
election of Democratic women who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting drop-off women voters to the polls _ those who voted
in 1996, but not in 1994 _ should be the top priority for Democrats
this year,'' said Mary Beth Cahill, executive director of EMILY's
List.
</P>
<P>
   As for Boggs, she isn't sure whether she'll vote Nov. 3.

EVERYDAY MIRACLES CAN BE HARD TO SEE, BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE

<P>
   The preacher was recounting the story about God parting the Red
Sea with a big gust of wind from his nostrils when my daughter
looked at me and asked, ``Mommy, is that true?''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, I nodded yes and turned my attention back to
the sermon of the day. Later, on the way home, Jamila asked that
question a second time and again I answered, ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why doesn't God do those things now?'' she wanted to
know.
</P>
<P>
   I told my little girl that miracles like that happen every day.
You just have to pay attention, because sometimes miracles are like
a cool breeze, a small ripple in a puddle, and other times they're
hot like lava spewing from a volcano or loud like a sonic boom.
</P>
<P>
   My answer seemed to satisfy her. A gentle peace seem to take
hold. But as I turned off Miller Avenue to get on U.S. 287 toward
home, I couldn't help thinking about Jamila's query, because
suddenly I had questions of my own: Did I really believe what I'd
told my little girl? And when was the last time God performed a
miracle in my life?
</P>
<P>
   Immediately I thought of my daughters, my living miracles. Yes,
they were the big ones. But there have been many others, not the
least of which is my own life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, every once in a while, when my faith wavers, I find that I
need another of God's miracles. Today, no, the past month, has been
one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   I get that urge, really, every time I look around me and can't
make sense of life's events, when it seems all the world has just
gone mad. It's the same sick feeling you get when you're spinning
in an out-of-control car and suddenly imagine yourself dying. Or
when you read about a gay man being beaten to death because some
people somewhere have let hatred and fear be their guide.
</P>
<P>
   At times like these, the harder I look for reasons to hope, the
harder it is to find them.
</P>
<P>
   There was one such reason last week when it was reported that
the Human Relations Commission is expected to approve a
recommendation to the Fort Worth City Council that it give gays
protection from discrimination. But no sooner did I learn of the
proposal than I also learned that there were attempts by the
Tarrant County American Family Association to block it.
</P>
<P>
   And so before long, that sick feeling is with me once more. Of
course, activist Fannie Lou Hamer would know what to do with that
kind of sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is easy to be sick and tired of being sick and tired
of all the mean-spiritedness done in the name of God. I get so sick
that I want to set things right in my own time and by my own
strength. I forget that sometimes it's better, maybe, to just stand
still.
</P>
<P>
   And in that moment that I am able to quiet my soul, when I can
hear the miracle-maker doing his perfect work, I see and might even
rejoice to see what I've always known: that if one sows a bad seed,
he will reap it.
</P>
<P>
   When I have a moment like this, and I often do, I realize that
God is yet again performing one of his miracles in my life and
because it is internal, it is of eternal value to me.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sea experiences happen, and they are important to remember.
But the best miracles are those that occur inside of us, that make
mean-spiritedness kind, indifference care and hateful hearts love.
</P>
<P>
   Do I really believe what I told my little girl? Yes. When was
the last time God performed a miracle in my life? Just now.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224. Note to
editors: This is the last vote chart of the 105th Congress. The
vote chart will resume in January. WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: omnisen
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Wednesday approved, 65-29, a $520 billion
appropriations bill that includes eight unresolved spending bills
to fund agencies for the fiscal year 1999. Among the items included
in the 3,825-page omnibus bill was $17.9 billion in funding for the
International Monetary Fund, $1.2 billion to hire new teachers, and
emergency funds for Bosnian peacekeeping missions and farmers.
Supporters said the bill funds necessary programs and the extra
expenditures come at a time when the federal government has a
surplus. Opponents criticized the closed process of arriving at the
budget compromise and said the proposals should have been openly
debated in Congress. Opponents also said the additional spending
compromises the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill. The president signed the bill into law Wednesday.

   The House Tuesday approved, 333-95, a $520 billion
appropriations bill that includes eight unresolved spending bills
to fund agencies for the fiscal year 1999. Among the items included
in the 3,825-page omnibus bill was $17.9 billion in funding for the
International Monetary Fund, $1.1 billion to hire new teachers, and
emergency funds for Bosnian peacekeeping missions and farmers.
Supporters said they were obligated to vote for the bill to avoid a
government shutdown. Opponents said they did not have time to read
the bill and said it ignored spending limits in favor of pursuing
special-interest projects. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill. The bill
was approved by the Senate Wednesday and signed into law by the
president the same day.

EXPECTED ATTACK ON OPEN RECORDS LAW SENDS CHILLING MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Nikitin is on trial in Russia for violating laws he
didn't even know existed.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Russian naval officer is charged with treason for
leaking information to a Norwegian environmental group about how
the navy disposes of nuclear waste. Nikitin and the Bellona
Foundation of Norway say the information used in a 1996 report
criticizing the Russian navy's handling of nuclear waste came from
public records.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old whistleblower could get up to 20 years in prison
for violating Defense Ministry decrees that have never been
published and were shown to Nikitin's lawyers for the first time on
Tuesday, the day his trial started.
</P>
<P>
   Nitikin's lawyers are arguing that under the Russian
Constitution, criminal charges can't be filed if based on
unpublished laws.
</P>
<P>
   Such judicial travesties could only happen in a repressed
country, you say, where open records and freedom of information
aren't cherished principles of a representative government.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Right here in the good ol' U.S. of A., open
government is under assault, despite the assurance in the First
Amendment that no threat to access by the people should be
initiated. One of the attacks, fomented by government officials who
should be protecting the public's right to know, would keep
citizens from finding out what information police use to justify
arrests or searches of their property.
</P>
<P>
   During the last legislative session in Texas alone, about 200
different bills were introduced that would have limited public
access to government information, according to research done by the
Legislative Advisory Committee of the Texas Daily Newspaper
Association and the Texas Press Association. Unfortunately, more of
the same is expected in next year's session.
</P>
<P>
   An especially troubling assault on open records is brewing in
the offices of district attorneys throughout the state. During the
interim, the Houston Chronicle and the Conroe Courier sued the
Montgomery County District Attorney's office to get access to
search warrant information in the particularly gruesome double
homicide of two teen-age women. State District Judge Fred Edwards
sealed the search warrant affidavit at the request of District
Attorney Mike McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal fought all the way to the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals to keep what has always been public information from being
released. After the court upheld an earlier decision by the 9th
Texas Court of Appeals in Beaumont that affidavits _ sworn
statements that support the issuance of search or arrest warrants _
are public once an order is executed, McDougal released the
information in January.
</P>
<P>
   But the district attorney made it very clear that that was not
the end of the story. In a Jan. 15 report in the Houston Chronicle,
McDougal said he was only releasing the information because the
court ordered him to do so. ``I plan to pursue this matter in the
next session of the state Legislature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the Austin American-Statesman reported that the
Texas District and County Attorneys Association is pushing to
change the law so that judges would have the power to seal
affidavit information.
</P>
<P>
   By accessing this information, newspapers aren't attempting to
jeopardize ongoing criminal investigations. They are, however,
dedicated to acting in the public's interest by serving as a check
on the inner workings of the criminal justice system. Having to
show your work keeps people honest, and that includes judges and
district attorneys. The potential for abuse exists if judges and
district attorneys are allowed to keep search and arrest warrant
information private until after a conviction. Everyone wants
criminals caught and brought to justice, but it must be done
legally, by following proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the average citizen be concerned about restrictions
in open records law? Heaven forbid, but the day could come that a
law enforcement agency shows up at your door with a search warrant
to sift through your belongings or to take samples of hair and
blood, or with an arrest warrant for a loved one. Wouldn't you want
to know what information they had to justify such actions?
</P>
<P>
   The DAs have to seek out a legislator to carry their water for
them. It will be interesting to see who, if anyone, picks up the
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   If the TDCAA prevails, citizens will only be able to find out
what is in those affidavits after a conviction is secured. If the
case never gets that far, the public will forever wonder if an
arrest or a search was legally justified in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Nitikin is on trial in Russia for breaking a law that
was never publicly published. Should some district attorneys get
their way, Americans could be arrested based on information that
does not have to be publicly disclosed. It's too close a comparison
for comfort.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio that Joe DiMaggio was supposed to throw
out the first ball in the opening game of the World Series. But
Sammy Sosa got the honors instead. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had let it be
known that he wanted DiMaggio to toss out the ceremonial first
pitch. But Chicago Cubs slugger Sosa filled in because DiMaggio,
83, was still hospitalized in Hollywood, Fla., recovering from a
lengthy bout with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about U.S. Supreme Court decisions said the court
rejected the cruel-and-unusual punishment appeal of a Florida
inmate. But no details were given. What was that case all about,
and what was the claimed cruel-and-unusual punishment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved William D. Elledge, who has spent 23 years
on death row after being convicted in three murders in a weekend
crime spree in August 1974. He pleaded guilty in March 1975 to
murdering and raping Margaret Strack in Hollywood, Fla. After
disposing of her body, Elledge fatally shot Edward Gaffney, a night
watchman at a Hollywood grocery store. He then took a bus to
Jacksonville, where he shot and killed Paul Nelson, owner of a
Jacksonville Beach motel. He was sentenced to death in the Strack
killing and life terms for the Gaffney and Nelson murders.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy execution delay constituted Elledge's
cruel-and-unusual punishment appeal. Justice Stephen Breyer, who
wrote a strongly worded dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court's
rejection of Elledge's appeal, said the prisoner's claim is a
serious one. ``Not only has he, in prison, faced the threat of
death for nearly a generation,'' Breyer wrote, ``but he has
experienced that delay because of the state's own faulty procedures
and not because of frivolous appeals on his own part.''
</P>
<P>
   Three successful appeals by Elledge account for 18 of the 23
years in the delay of his execution. The Florida Supreme Court and
federal courts overturned his three previous death sentences for
the Strack killing because of errors by Broward County Judge Dan
Futch, now retired. A fourth appeal, which ultimately failed when
the Florida Supreme Court voted against him 4-2, accounts for the
additional five years of delay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the nation's worst rivers for fish with high levels
of toxic chemicals?
</P>
<P>
   A: Various stretches of different rivers are toxic with
different chemicals. Rivers with significant contaminants affecting
fish tissue, as tested by the Environmental Protection Agency,
include the Monongahela, measured at Clairton, Pa.; the
Chattahoochee, at Whitesburg, Ga.; the Haw, at Saxapahaw, N.C.; the
Fox, at Portage, Wis.; the Missouri, at Kansas City, Mo.; the
Mississippi, at Natchez, Miss., and West Alton, Mo.; the Des
Plaines, at Lockport, Ill.; the Nishnabotna, at Hamburg, Iowa; the
Great Miami, at New Baltimore, Ohio; and the Ohio, at West Point,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that Mississippi requires all its
casinos to be on water, floating either on the Mississippi River or
its tributaries, or in the Gulf of Mexico. What about the Silver
Star Resort and Casino near Philadelphia, Miss.? Isn't it on dry
land?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but there's an explanation. By Mississippi law, all
licensed casinos operating in the state are required to be on
water, said Charles Patton, executive director of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. ut Indian tribes, through federal law, can put
casinos on tribal reservations, he added, saying that the Silver
Star falls into that category. It's operated under the auspices of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and is regulated by ``the feds,''
Patton said. It isn't licensed or regulated by the state of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Nancy Fowler of Conyers, Ga., who reported
again recently on her vision of the Virgin Mary, said believers
could get further information on the Internet. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's www.conyers.org. A woman answering the telephone at Our
Loving Mothers Children, Fowler's organization, said the lines
often are jammed, and asked people ``not to despair'' if they can't
get to the Web site immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an ad on TV for a video about Mark McGwire's and Sammy
Sosa's great home run season, but I didn't get the number. Do you
have it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Major League Baseball Productions at 1-800-537-7070. The
tape, ``Race for the Record,'' costs $19.95 plus $4.95 for shipping
and handling, with delivery expected to take four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Parade magazine mentioned a poem, ``For Those I Love,'' by
Isla Paschal Richardson, read at Frank Sinatra's funeral mass by
Gregory Peck. Can you print it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   If I should ever leave you/ of whom I Love/
</P>
<P>
   To go along the Silent Way/ grieve not,/
</P>
<P>
   Nor speak of me with tears,/ but laugh and talk/
</P>
<P>
   Of me as if I were/ beside you there./
</P>
<P>
   (I'd come _ I'd come,/ could I but find a way!/
</P>
<P>
   But would not tears and grief be barriers?)/
</P>
<P>
   And when you hear a song/ or see a bird/
</P>
<P>
   I loved, please do not let/ the thought of me/
</P>
<P>
   Be sad . . . For I am/ loving you just as/
</P>
<P>
   I always have . . ./
</P>
<P>
   You were so good to me!/
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things/ I wanted still/
</P>
<P>
   To do so many things/ to say to you . . ./
</P>
<P>
   Remember that I/ did not fear . . . It was/
</P>
<P>
   Just leaving you/ that was so hard to face . . ./
</P>
<P>
   We cannot see Beyond . . . / But this I know:/
</P>
<P>
   I loved you so _ 'twas heaven/ here with you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I say a residential mailbox is the property of the U.S.
Postal Service and cannot be used for anything other than mail. A
friend says it's the homeowner's property and can be used for
anything. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're both right, in a sense, said U.S. Postal Service
spokeswoman Sandra Harding in Washington. The outside of the
mailbox is the homeowner's property. But the inside, which is
restricted to mail for pickup or delivery, is the domain of the
Postal Service. This means that only mail bearing postage can be
inside the mailbox. In places where curbside delivery is offered,
the mailbox must be of a type approved by the Postal Service. The
homeowner is responsible for installing it properly. For more
information, check with your postmaster, Harding advises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a Japanese pilot who, in World War II, dropped
bombs on Oregon in an attempt to start forest fires. What kind of
plane did he use, and from what base did he operate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Nobuo Fujita, who died at age 85 on Sept.
30, 1997, in Japan. He didn't fly from a land base. On Sept. 9,
1942, a Japanese submarine carrying a crew of about 100 slipped
across the Pacific to the unprotected waters off the Oregon coast.
In the predawn darkness, the sub came to the surface and a catapult
launched Fujita's plane, a Yokosuka E-14-Y, into the air. It had
folding wings and was assembled by the sub's crew when it surfaced.
He flew back and landed on the plane's floats beside the sub, which
took him and the plane back aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita flew two missions in which he dropped fire bombs over
wooded areas in Oregon. None caused much of a blaze, but they did
provoke some alarm. Fujita's missions may not have been the only
Japanese bombing attempts on the U.S. mainland, however. Some
reports said another mission was aimed at an oil refinery in
southern California, but it failed to spark the desired nationwide
panic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports said a number of people were killed by floods
and mudslides when Typhoon Zeb swept through the Philippines. Where
exactly in the Philippines was the most destruction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Zeb was of ``super typhoon'' status when it made landfall
Oct. 14 near Palanan town in Isabela province (a storm gains that
status when its maximum sustained winds reach 138 mph; some of
Zeb's gusts were clocked at 184 mph). As it continued to pound the
northern Philippines, deaths were reported in Solano town in Nueva
Vizcaya province; southeastern Taitung; Benguet province; and
Antipolo, just outside Manila. By Friday, reports said at least 74
people were dead, mostly by drowning or in mudslides, but the
casualty figure was expected to rise because several northern
villages remained isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Barbara Jane Mackle, the heiress who was
kidnapped for ransom in Atlanta some years ago? Where was the place
she was buried alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mackle, who was kidnapped in 1968, tries to live a normal
life with her family in Florida. She does not grant interviews. The
site where she was buried in a plywood box, fitted with two pipes
to provide air, was about a mile from the City Hall at Berkeley
Lake, Ga., in Gwinnett County near Atlanta. Mackle, then a
20-year-old student at Emory University in Atlanta, spent about 3
1/2 days buried about two feet underground before she was rescued.
She went home to Miami; her captors, Gary Steven Krist, a
University of Miami researcher known by an alias, and his
accomplice, Ruth Eisemann-Schier, were caught. The FBI chalked up
the case as a success.

   EDS: COX NEWS SERVICE IS MOVING NEWS-QUESTIONS IN TWO PARTS.
THIS IS PART TWO.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that only eight states do not have a hate crimes
law of some type. What are those states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, South
Carolina and Wyoming have no hate crimes laws for anyone, according
to the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. Laws in Maryland,
Texas and Utah are ``unclear,'' the organization says. The District
of Columbia and 21 states have hate crimes laws that include sexual
orientation, and 18 states' hate crimes laws do not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton recently flew to California on Air Force
One to raise money for Democratic candidates and to visit daughter
Chelsea. How much did this cost, and who pays?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clinton White House, like those before it, doesn't
calculate or publicly disclose the full scope of the operations _
military, security, transportation, communication and political _
involved every time a president goes on the road. But the White
House has said previously that Air Force One costs $35,300 an hour
to operate. So a 10-hour round-trip flight between Washington and
the West Coast would cost $353,000. The president's trips basically
are federally funded, which means U.S. taxpayers foot the bill, but
when trips such as the one to California include official business
on behalf of the Democratic Party and local political campaigns,
they share some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned last year about the propriety of partisan
fund-raising tours, Democrats countered by saying they are proper
and even helpful. ``I think it's part of being president,''
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said. ``That's just a necessary part of
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans occupied the White House, the GOP followed a
similar practice using Air Force One, and also encountered
questions. In April 1992, for example, Sen. Dennis DeConcini
(D-Ariz.) said he saw ``something wrong'' about President George
Bush using Air Force One to mix politics with official business.
But Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, pointed out that even
when traveling for political purposes, Bush couldn't escape his
duties as commander in chief, requiring a coterie of security and
other personnel as well as communications, transportation and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ricky Williams, the terrific running back for the University
of Texas, pays homage publicly to the late Doak Walker. Can you
give us a history of Walker's athletic accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: A great fan favorite at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas, Walker was a 5-foot-11, 170-pound single-wing tailback who
was named a consensus All-American three years in a row, starting
in 1947. He won the 1948 Heisman Trophy as college football's
outstanding player. The ``Doaker,'' as he was called, was so
popular at SMU that a deck of seats was added to the Cotton Bowl,
SMU's home field, to accommodate all the fans who wanted to watch
him play. His coach, Matty Bell, said of him, ``Some called it
luck, others called it destiny, but Doak has a natural knack for
pulling off great deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker joined the NFL's Detroit Lions in 1950. Despite his size,
he promptly led the league in scoring with 128 points and was named
both rookie of the year and an All-Pro at halfback. A remarkably
versatile player, he scored 534 points during his six-year NFL
career, during which the Lions won two NFL championships. Although
the Lions offered Walker a big contract to return in 1956, he chose
to retire to pursue business interests in his native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams honored Walker by wearing his No. 37 Oct. 10 in the
Texas-Oklahoma game at the Cotton Bowl. Williams and Walker became
friends last season when Williams received the Doak Walker Award,
which goes to the nation's best running back. Just weeks after the
two met, Walker was seriously injured in a skiing accident in
Colorado that left him paralyzed. He died last month at 71 from
complications from those injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Bilderberg group? The New York Times refers to it
as ``the most elite of the establishment clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bilderbergers include about 100 of Europe and North
America's most influential bankers, economists, politicians and
government officials. They meet yearly for a three-day conference,
always conducted in a rigid atmosphere of security, that
occasionally gives rise to various conspiracy theories about the
group's aims. But the Bilderbergers say the required pledge of
delegates not to discuss what goes on at their meetings is simply
to provide a private, informal environment in which those who
influence national policies and international affairs can get to
know each other and discuss, without commitment, their common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The conferences were initiated by Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands in 1954. Meeting locations vary. This year's session
was held in May at Turnberry resort in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an address where we can send donations and messages
of condolence to the family of Matthew Shepard, the gay student
from Laramie, Wyo., who died after being savagely beaten?
</P>
<P>
   A: Donations can be made to: Matthew Shepard Fund (1926083), c/o
1st National Bank, P.O. Box 578, Fort Collins, CO 80522. Poudre
Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, where the student died, has set up
an e-mail address for Shepard's family: mshepard(at)libra.pvh.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article mentioned an apparition in Portugal in 1917 in
which the Virgin Mary told three secrets to some children. Is it
known what the secrets were?
</P>
<P>
   A: The secrets, revealed by the Virgin Mary to three Portuguese
cousins in a series of visions while they were tending sheep in
Fatima, Portugal, were written down by Lucia dos Santos _ the sole
survivor of the three and now a 91-year-old nun _ and passed to the
Vatican in 1944. They are held in the Vatican and have never been
published.
</P>
<P>
   But a report last year in The Times of London offered some
information, saying the Vatican was seeking to reassure Italians
about widespread fears that Umbrian earthquakes presaged a
premillennial disaster, possibly the end of the world. That
apocalyptic doom was said to be the third secret of Fatima, to
which only the pope and his closest advisers have access.
</P>
<P>
   The Times went on to disclose speculation about the first and
second secrets. The first is said to offer a hellish vision of
``charred bodies in an ocean of fire,'' a possible forecast of
World War II, coupled with a message to the world to repent. The
second, disclosed in 1942 by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster of Milan,
Italy, was that Russia, which was in the grip of its Marxist
revolution at the time of the visions, would ``spread her errors
throughout the world, causing wars and persecution,'' but ultimate
disaster would be averted if Russia reconverted to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Oct. 21, Loris Francesco Capovilla, the
former secretary to Pope John XXIII, said the third secret
contained no ``deadline of doom,'' adding that it is not linked to
the end of the millennium as people have claimed. He told the
Italian newspaper La Stampa that he couldn't reveal what the third
secret was, but talk of ``millions of deaths'' was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that Georgia ranks as one of the
worst states in the nation in a survey on the amount of ozone
pollution. What states have the least ozone pollution?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington
analyzed air quality data from most states and the District of
Columbia and ranked them by the number of ``unhealthy smog days.''
Nine states were not included because there's little or no publicly
available data; 14 other states were included, even though only
partial data was available. Of the remainder that were ranked,
these were found to have the fewest violations of the stricter
ozone pollution standard issued last year by the Environmental
Protection Agency: South Carolina (lowest), followed in order by
Oklahoma, Illinois, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Colorado,
Maine, Massachusetts and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that food stamps can be used only for food or
food products for human consumption. I once overheard a grocery
store manager saying they could be used only for foods grown or
processed in the United States. Virginia ham was acceptable, for
example, but canned Polish ham was not. Is that still true?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no restrictions on the origin of the foods that can
be purchased with food stamps, said Susan Acker of the Department
of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. But that wasn't always
the case. When the food stamp program was a pilot project between
1961 and 1964, the stamps were restricted to foods or food products
either grown or processed in the United States. However, when the
program officially started, that restriction was dropped and
recipients could use stamps for foods from anywhere: Caviar from
Russia or peanuts from Georgia were equally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an e-mail address for the national Democratic party?
</P>
<P>
   A: To contact the Democratic National Committee by e-mail, go to
its Web site _ www.democrats.org/contact.html _ and sign the guest
book form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Rose Mary Woods, the personal secretary
for Richard Nixon who was involved in the infamous Watergate tape?
</P>
<P>
   A: Woods, 80, who remained on Nixon's staff until 1976, has
lived in Alliance, Ohio, since retirement. Her biggest claim to
fame involved a mysterious gap of 18 1/2 minutes in a crucial
Watergate tape recording. In testimony before Chief U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica on Nov. 8, 1973, Woods reacted angrily to
suggestions that she might have accidentally altered or erased any
of the conversation on the tapes she was making transcripts from.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony soon afterward, she had a different attitude,
explaining that when the telephone rang while she was transcribing
from the tape, she ``must have pushed the record button, which is
right next to the top button (on the recording machine).'' The
result was a gap of four or five minutes. She always denied that
she could have caused the full 18 1/2-minute gap, but White House
files made public in 1995 indicate that Nixon White House lawyers
blamed her for the full gap, and believed she caused it
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Articles last year tracing the whereabouts of a number of
Watergate figures included only a brief mention of Woods, who
apparently doesn't talk to reporters. She said only that she
doesn't get asked about Watergate much anymore.

   Q: I heard on the radio that Joe DiMaggio was supposed to throw
out the first ball in the opening game of the World Series. But
Sammy Sosa got the honors instead. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had let it be
known that he wanted DiMaggio to toss out the ceremonial first
pitch. But Chicago Cubs slugger Sosa filled in because DiMaggio,
83, was still hospitalized in Hollywood, Fla., recovering from a
lengthy bout with pneumonia.

fish tissue, as tested by the Environmental Protection Agency,
include the Monongahela, measured at Clairton, Pa.; the
Chattahoochee, at Whitesburg, Ga.; the Haw, at Saxapahaw, N.C.; the
Fox, at Portage, Wis.; the Missouri, at Kansas City, Mo.; the
Mississippi, at Natchez, Miss., and West Alton, Mo.; the Des

   A: Yes, but there's an explanation. By Mississippi law, all
licensed casinos operating in the state are required to be on
water, said Charles Patton, executive director of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. ut Indian tribes, through federal law, can put
casinos on tribal reservations, he added, saying that the Silver
Star falls into that category. It's operated under the auspices of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and is regulated by ``the feds,''
Patton said. It isn't licensed or regulated by the state of
Mississippi.

   Q: An article about Nancy Fowler of Conyers, Ga., who reported
again recently on her vision of the Virgin Mary, said believers
could get further information on the Internet. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's www.conyers.org. A woman answering the telephone at Our
Loving Mothers Children, Fowler's organization, said the lines
often are jammed, and asked people ``not to despair'' if they can't
get to the Web site immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an ad on TV for a video about Mark McGwire's and Sammy
Sosa's great home run season, but I didn't get the number. Do you
have it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Major League Baseball Productions at 1-800-537-7070. The
tape, ``Race for the Record,'' costs $19.95 plus $4.95 for shipping
and handling, with delivery expected to take four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Parade magazine mentioned a poem, ``For Those I Love,'' by
Isla Paschal Richardson, read at Frank Sinatra's funeral mass by
Gregory Peck. Can you print it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   If I should ever leave you/ of whom I Love/
</P>
<P>
   To go along the Silent Way/ grieve not,/
</P>
<P>
   Nor speak of me with tears,/ but laugh and talk/
</P>
<P>
   Of me as if I were/ beside you there./
</P>
<P>
   (I'd come _ I'd come,/ could I but find a way!/
</P>
<P>
   But would not tears and grief be barriers?)/
</P>
<P>
   And when you hear a song/ or see a bird/
</P>
<P>
   I loved, please do not let/ the thought of me/
</P>
<P>
   Be sad . . . For I am/ loving you just as/
</P>
<P>
   I always have . . ./
</P>
<P>
   You were so good to me!/
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things/ I wanted still/
</P>
<P>
   To do so many things/ to say to you . . ./
</P>
<P>
   Remember that I/ did not fear . . . It was/
</P>
<P>
   Just leaving you/ that was so hard to face . . ./
</P>
<P>
   We cannot see Beyond . . . / But this I know:/
</P>
<P>
   I loved you so _ 'twas heaven/ here with you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I say a residential mailbox is the property of the U.S.
Postal Service and cannot be used for anything other than mail. A
friend says it's the homeowner's property and can be used for
anything. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're both right, in a sense, said U.S. Postal Service
spokeswoman Sandra Harding in Washington. The outside of the
mailbox is the homeowner's property. But the inside, which is
restricted to mail for pickup or delivery, is the domain of the
Postal Service. This means that only mail bearing postage can be
inside the mailbox. In places where curbside delivery is offered,
the mailbox must be of a type approved by the Postal Service. The
homeowner is responsible for installing it properly. For more
information, check with your postmaster, Harding advises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a Japanese pilot who, in World War II, dropped
bombs on Oregon in an attempt to start forest fires. What kind of
plane did he use, and from what base did he operate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Nobuo Fujita, who died at age 85 on Sept.
30, 1997, in Japan. He didn't fly from a land base. On Sept. 9,
1942, a Japanese submarine carrying a crew of about 100 slipped
across the Pacific to the unprotected waters off the Oregon coast.
In the predawn darkness, the sub came to the surface and a catapult
launched Fujita's plane, a Yokosuka E-14-Y, into the air. It had
folding wings and was assembled by the sub's crew when it surfaced.
He flew back and landed on the plane's floats beside the sub, which
took him and the plane back aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita flew two missions in which he dropped fire bombs over
wooded areas in Oregon. None caused much of a blaze, but they did
provoke some alarm. Fujita's missions may not have been the only
Japanese bombing attempts on the U.S. mainland, however. Some
reports said another mission was aimed at an oil refinery in
southern California, but it failed to spark the desired nationwide
panic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports said a number of people were killed by floods
and mudslides when Typhoon Zeb swept through the Philippines. Where
exactly in the Philippines was the most destruction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Zeb was of ``super typhoon'' status when it made landfall
Oct. 14 near Palanan town in Isabela province (a storm gains that
status when its maximum sustained winds reach 138 mph; some of
Zeb's gusts were clocked at 184 mph). As it continued to pound the
northern Philippines, deaths were reported in Solano town in Nueva
Vizcaya province; southeastern Taitung; Benguet province; and
Antipolo, just outside Manila. By Friday, reports said at least 74
people were dead, mostly by drowning or in mudslides, but the
casualty figure was expected to rise because several northern
villages remained isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Barbara Jane Mackle, the heiress who was
kidnapped for ransom in Atlanta some years ago? Where was the place
she was buried alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mackle, who was kidnapped in 1968, tries to live a normal
life with her family in Florida. She does not grant interviews. The
site where she was buried in a plywood box, fitted with two pipes
to provide air, was about a mile from the City Hall at Berkeley
Lake, Ga., in Gwinnett County near Atlanta. Mackle, then a
20-year-old student at Emory University in Atlanta, spent about 3
1/2 days buried about two feet underground before she was rescued.
She went home to Miami; her captors, Gary Steven Krist, a
University of Miami researcher known by an alias, and his
accomplice, Ruth Eisemann-Schier, were caught. The FBI chalked up
the case as a success.

   EDS: COX NEWS SERVICE IS MOVING NEWS-QUESTIONS IN TWO PARTS.
THIS IS PART TWO.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that only eight states do not have a hate crimes
law of some type. What are those states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, South
Carolina and Wyoming have no hate crimes laws for anyone, according
to the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. Laws in Maryland,
Texas and Utah are ``unclear,'' the organization says. The District
of Columbia and 21 states have hate crimes laws that include sexual
orientation, and 18 states' hate crimes laws do not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton recently flew to California on Air Force
One to raise money for Democratic candidates and to visit daughter
Chelsea. How much did this cost, and who pays?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clinton White House, like those before it, doesn't
calculate or publicly disclose the full scope of the operations _
military, security, transportation, communication and political _
involved every time a president goes on the road. But the White
House has said previously that Air Force One costs $35,300 an hour
to operate. So a 10-hour round-trip flight between Washington and
the West Coast would cost $353,000. The president's trips basically
are federally funded, which means U.S. taxpayers foot the bill, but
when trips such as the one to California include official business
on behalf of the Democratic Party and local political campaigns,
they share some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned last year about the propriety of partisan
fund-raising tours, Democrats countered by saying they are proper
and even helpful. ``I think it's part of being president,''
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said. ``That's just a necessary part of
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans occupied the White House, the GOP followed a
similar practice using Air Force One, and also encountered
questions. In April 1992, for example, Sen. Dennis DeConcini
(D-Ariz.) said he saw ``something wrong'' about President George
Bush using Air Force One to mix politics with official business.
But Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, pointed out that even
when traveling for political purposes, Bush couldn't escape his
duties as commander in chief, requiring a coterie of security and
other personnel as well as communications, transportation and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ricky Williams, the terrific running back for the University
of Texas, pays homage publicly to the late Doak Walker. Can you
give us a history of Walker's athletic accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: A great fan favorite at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas, Walker was a 5-foot-11, 170-pound single-wing tailback who
was named a consensus All-American three years in a row, starting
in 1947. He won the 1948 Heisman Trophy as college football's
outstanding player. The ``Doaker,'' as he was called, was so
popular at SMU that a deck of seats was added to the Cotton Bowl,
SMU's home field, to accommodate all the fans who wanted to watch
him play. His coach, Matty Bell, said of him, ``Some called it
luck, others called it destiny, but Doak has a natural knack for
pulling off great deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker joined the NFL's Detroit Lions in 1950. Despite his size,
he promptly led the league in scoring with 128 points and was named
both rookie of the year and an All-Pro at halfback. A remarkably
versatile player, he scored 534 points during his six-year NFL
career, during which the Lions won two NFL championships. Although
the Lions offered Walker a big contract to return in 1956, he chose
to retire to pursue business interests in his native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams honored Walker by wearing his No. 37 Oct. 10 in the
Texas-Oklahoma game at the Cotton Bowl. Williams and Walker became
friends last season when Williams received the Doak Walker Award,
which goes to the nation's best running back. Just weeks after the
two met, Walker was seriously injured in a skiing accident in
Colorado that left him paralyzed. He died last month at 71 from
complications from those injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Bilderberg group? The New York Times refers to it
as ``the most elite of the establishment clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bilderbergers include about 100 of Europe and North
America's most influential bankers, economists, politicians and
government officials. They meet yearly for a three-day conference,
always conducted in a rigid atmosphere of security, that
occasionally gives rise to various conspiracy theories about the
group's aims. But the Bilderbergers say the required pledge of
delegates not to discuss what goes on at their meetings is simply
to provide a private, informal environment in which those who
influence national policies and international affairs can get to
know each other and discuss, without commitment, their common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The conferences were initiated by Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands in 1954. Meeting locations vary. This year's session
was held in May at Turnberry resort in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an address where we can send donations and messages
of condolence to the family of Matthew Shepard, the gay student
from Laramie, Wyo., who died after being savagely beaten?
</P>
<P>
   A: Donations can be made to: Matthew Shepard Fund (1926083), c/o
1st National Bank, P.O. Box 578, Fort Collins, CO 80522. Poudre
Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, where the student died, has set up
an e-mail address for Shepard's family: mshepard(at)libra.pvh.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article mentioned an apparition in Portugal in 1917 in
which the Virgin Mary told three secrets to some children. Is it
known what the secrets were?
</P>
<P>
   A: The secrets, revealed by the Virgin Mary to three Portuguese
cousins in a series of visions while they were tending sheep in
Fatima, Portugal, were written down by Lucia dos Santos _ the sole
survivor of the three and now a 91-year-old nun _ and passed to the
Vatican in 1944. They are held in the Vatican and have never been
published.
</P>
<P>
   But a report last year in The Times of London offered some
information, saying the Vatican was seeking to reassure Italians
about widespread fears that Umbrian earthquakes presaged a
premillennial disaster, possibly the end of the world. That
apocalyptic doom was said to be the third secret of Fatima, to
which only the pope and his closest advisers have access.
</P>
<P>
   The Times went on to disclose speculation about the first and
second secrets. The first is said to offer a hellish vision of
``charred bodies in an ocean of fire,'' a possible forecast of
World War II, coupled with a message to the world to repent. The
second, disclosed in 1942 by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster of Milan,
Italy, was that Russia, which was in the grip of its Marxist
revolution at the time of the visions, would ``spread her errors
throughout the world, causing wars and persecution,'' but ultimate
disaster would be averted if Russia reconverted to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Oct. 21, Loris Francesco Capovilla, the
former secretary to Pope John XXIII, said the third secret
contained no ``deadline of doom,'' adding that it is not linked to
the end of the millennium as people have claimed. He told the
Italian newspaper La Stampa that he couldn't reveal what the third
secret was, but talk of ``millions of deaths'' was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that Georgia ranks as one of the
worst states in the nation in a survey on the amount of ozone
pollution. What states have the least ozone pollution?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington
analyzed air quality data from most states and the District of
Columbia and ranked them by the number of ``unhealthy smog days.''
Nine states were not included because there's little or no publicly
available data; 14 other states were included, even though only
partial data was available. Of the remainder that were ranked,
these were found to have the fewest violations of the stricter
ozone pollution standard issued last year by the Environmental
Protection Agency: South Carolina (lowest), followed in order by
Oklahoma, Illinois, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Colorado,
Maine, Massachusetts and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that food stamps can be used only for food or
food products for human consumption. I once overheard a grocery
store manager saying they could be used only for foods grown or
processed in the United States. Virginia ham was acceptable, for
example, but canned Polish ham was not. Is that still true?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no restrictions on the origin of the foods that can
be purchased with food stamps, said Susan Acker of the Department
of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. But that wasn't always
the case. When the food stamp program was a pilot project between
1961 and 1964, the stamps were restricted to foods or food products
either grown or processed in the United States. However, when the
program officially started, that restriction was dropped and
recipients could use stamps for foods from anywhere: Caviar from
Russia or peanuts from Georgia were equally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an e-mail address for the national Democratic party?
</P>
<P>
   A: To contact the Democratic National Committee by e-mail, go to
its Web site _ www.democrats.org/contact.html _ and sign the guest
book form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Rose Mary Woods, the personal secretary
for Richard Nixon who was involved in the infamous Watergate tape?
</P>
<P>
   A: Woods, 80, who remained on Nixon's staff until 1976, has
lived in Alliance, Ohio, since retirement. Her biggest claim to
fame involved a mysterious gap of 18 1/2 minutes in a crucial
Watergate tape recording. In testimony before Chief U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica on Nov. 8, 1973, Woods reacted angrily to
suggestions that she might have accidentally altered or erased any
of the conversation on the tapes she was making transcripts from.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony soon afterward, she had a different attitude,
explaining that when the telephone rang while she was transcribing
from the tape, she ``must have pushed the record button, which is
right next to the top button (on the recording machine).'' The
result was a gap of four or five minutes. She always denied that
she could have caused the full 18 1/2-minute gap, but White House
files made public in 1995 indicate that Nixon White House lawyers
blamed her for the full gap, and believed she caused it
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Articles last year tracing the whereabouts of a number of
Watergate figures included only a brief mention of Woods, who
apparently doesn't talk to reporters. She said only that she
doesn't get asked about Watergate much anymore.

MOST TEXAS CATTLE RAISERS SHOULD WEATHER DRY SPELL IF RAIN HOLDS
OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWIE, Texas _ The drought's break is a welcome sight to cattle
ranchers J.K. ``Rooter'' Brite Jr. and Lynda Brite. In fact, it
could keep them from dropping $60,000 in revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of moisture since the spring had already cost the
Brites _ a husband and wife team who run the JA Ranch near Bowie, a
North Texas farming town _ valuable fall grazing for their calves
and cows. It will cut profits at least into next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brites hope that the recent rainfall will boost output
on the 330 acres of grains and grass they have planted for grazing
through the winter. Without the rain, the ranch could have lost all
of that, cutting the number of calves the couple could graze and
sell and bringing next year's revenues down by about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Brites, who manage more than 3,900 acres, have already made
the prudent move, selling about 30 percent of their cow herd and
more than 15 percent of their calves earlier than they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We either make the right move, which is reduce the numbers by
that amount, or we're creating a very real possibility that we're
going to have major shortages on our native forages and that we'll
damage these forages several seasons out,'' Rooter Brite, 46, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brites certainly aren't alone. Texas is the nation's largest
cattle-producing state. As the drought worsened this summer,
producers stepped up the culling of herds, and cattle prices,
already low in an oversupplied market with slowing demand for meat
exports, declined further.
</P>
<P>
   For producers, the good news is twofold: Good weather patterns
might be resuming. And this year's situation for most wasn't as bad
as producers saw during the 1995-96 drought: Cattle prices haven't
plunged, and herd reductions and income losses haven't escalated to
the same levels. The cow sell-off this year probably amounts to no
more than 1 percent to 1.5 percent, said economist Ernie Davis, a
state-level livestock marketing specialist for the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   Still ``it took us out of a (herd) rebuilding year,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gill, a regional extension livestock specialist based in
Dallas, said, ``Ranchers are likely to be losing money for some
months to come.''
</P>
<P>
   While pastures are reviving in rain-drenched southern, central
and eastern counties of Texas, many ranchers with weakened grazing
areas elsewhere in the state are expected to add to the Texas
cattle inventory reduction that began in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Wide areas remain dry, from northwest of Amarillo to the Abilene
area, to the western fringes of the Metroplex and into portions of
West Central Texas. The Brites are among the luckier cattle
producers operating northwest of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, livestock-related losses from this year's drought are
already estimated at $451 million due to inventory-reduction sales
and higher spending on feeds and hay. Livestock-related losses in
1995-96 totaled more than $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the bottom line will be a lower beef supply and
perhaps rising prices next year and into 2000, possibly continuing
into 2002 and 2003, Davis said. But larger competing pork and
poultry supplies will dampen some or perhaps all of the upward
pressure on beef prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers have been trying to hang on to as many cows as
possible, to capitalize on a rebound in cattle prices expected when
the drought cycle breaks and grasses revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're banking on is that we'll have a spring next
year'' with normal rainfall, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final blow, Davis, the livestock economist, figures
that only a few full-time cattle producers won't survive; more
dropouts will come from the numerous part-timers, hobbyists and
others with high nonranch income.
</P>
<P>
   Texas producers looked on with great interest last week, when
Congress and President Clinton compromised on a $5.94 billion
package of aid that includes $200 million in feed- and hay-buying
subsidies. Producers in Texas and at least 10 other states will
share in that.
</P>
<P>
   It would be helpful near Olney at the 109-year-old Campbell
Ranch, which had been living off about 3 inches of moisture since
April when up to 3 more inches fell in September and October.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it is, we're just crippling along,'' said Alan Lewis, 51,
who runs the ranch for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Ranch is known in the trade for its conservative
pasture-stocking levels, now running about 600 head on 10,000 owned
and leased acres. The ranch, partially because of that strategy,
had enough grass to retain more of its better cows this year than
expected, although Lewis has culled more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Brites, the Bowie-area producers, are already selling 115 of
their ranch's approximate 360 cows this month. Brite said the cows
will likely go to slaughter about three years before their
reproductive life in the herd would normally end. That means
getting an average of three fewer calves from each cow. He has
already sold about 50 steer calves ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Brite is figuring a 50 percent to 80 percent increase in his
fall-winter supplemental feeding costs for the remaining 245-250
cows.
</P>
<P>
   Brite, who still has about 250 ranch-born calves, says if the
rainfall continues, he might buy more to graze. But if the rains
stop, he said, his gross ranch income could drop by 40 percent or
more in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   JA Ranch usually provides 75 percent of the family's livelihood,
with real estate ventures and other off-ranch investments providing
more income.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a ranch profit this year and probably not next
year,'' he said. But ``we have liquidity, and we're not going to
lose our operation.''

 &HT;    MODERATE GOP WOMEN WIELD CLOUT
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA-The most powerful people on Nov. 3 will be moderate
Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   In tight races around the country involving women candidates for
governor, they could be the deciding factor. In Colorado, for
example, where Democratic Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler is running dead
even with conservative Republican state Sen. Bill Owens, moderate
Republican women may support Schoettler because of her stands on
education, the environment and reproductive choice. They could put
her over the top.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, GOP candidate Linda Lingle, who is pro-choice and
pro-public education, may oust the Democratic governor. In Rhode
Island, Democratic gubernatorial challenger Myrth York is picking
up the support of Republican moderates, men and women, in a race
that's tied in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Women voters as a whole will have the upper hand Nov. 3 if the
trend that began in 1986 continues. In every election since,
presidential and nonpresidential, the proportion of eligible female
adults who voted has exceeded the proportion of eligible male
voters. Some pollsters predict a larger-than-ever female voter
turnout because education, health care and the environment, this
year's hot-button issues, motivate female voters.
</P>
<P>
   Organized efforts like the nonpartisan ``Women Count'' in
California are aimed at turning women in both parties out to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even in races not involving female candidates, moderate GOP
women are the swing vote. It's telling that Georgia Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes is staging a ``Women for
Barnes'' bus tour this weekend, with the help of GOP activist Candy
Sprague, head of ``Republicans for Barnes.'' Sprague has been key
to a bipartisan statewide campaign network of 3,000 women for
Barnes whose GOP opponent has ties to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that women control the outcome of this
race,'' says Gary Horlacher, the Barnes campaign's press aide. Like
other Democratic candidates around the country, Barnes has been
emphasizing education programs begun by Democratic Gov. Zell Miller
_ after-school programs, the HOPE college scholarships and free
pre-kindergarten classes. But Barnes often speaks to female
audiences about doctor choice and the right to sue managed-care
companies that wrongly deny needed care. Studies show women are the
primary decision-makers on health care choices and spending.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging signs for moderates is that the
anti-abortion theme that helped elect social conservatives to
Congress in 1994 isn't working this time. ``Incumbent conservatives
aren't running on the pro-life issues this year,'' says Gilda
Morales, information coordinator for the Rutgers Center for the
American Woman and Politics. In fact, they seem to be running from
them. One glaring exception is anti-abortion activist Fay Boozman,
the GOP's U.S. Senate nominee in Arkansas. In a recent forum,
Boozman said God gives women a ``hormonal shield'' in cases of
rape, so they rarely get pregnant. His Democratic opponent, Blanche
Lincoln, has since moved ahead 18 points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republican women, as candidates and voters, are the
salvation of this election. They may not always wield power within
the GOP, but on Nov. 3, they'll pull the levers. And they could
determine for all Americans whether the political center still
holds.

BOXER, FONG COMPETE FOR VOTES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Sen. Barbara Boxer is fighting to
re-establish what some analysts say could be her greatest asset in
her race for re-election: incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign swing through California's fertile Central Valley,
the Democratic incumbent reminded voters of her service in
Washington over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot together,'' Boxer told 50 supporters Thursday at
an event in Stockton highlighting her support for the 1994 crime
bill, which provided funding for 173 new police officers in that
city. ``I want to keep us working together.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes as a new poll by the Los Angeles Times shows
Boxer pulling slightly ahead of her Republican opponent, state
Treasurer Matt Fong, by 5 percentage points, 49 percent to 44
percent, among those likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   That is seen as less a sign of a newfound popularity for Boxer
than proof the negative commercials she has begun running against
Fong on issues like abortion and the environment are cutting into
his support.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers have criticized Boxer for doing little
in her race against Fong to remind voters that she is a sitting
senator at a time when the economy is solid, crime is down and
voters are generally content.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to focus on what she has delivered for California,''
said Barbara O'Connor, communications professor at California State
University in Sacramento. ``She needs to highlight what she's been
able to bring home.''
</P>
<P>
   With just days before the election, both Boxer and Fong are
crisscrossing the state. Each is still furiously raising money in
order to plaster voters with expensive, last-minute television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   For Fong, the campaign has become nearly all fund-raising, with
rarely more than one public event a day. He explains that he has
held public events throughout the campaign, but must now focus on
securing cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a challenger, I need to raise the dollars to compete,''
Fong said after a $125,000 fund-raiser in San Francisco Wednesday
night. Citing the new barrage of negative ads against him, ``I have
to answer those charges, and that's what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who adeptly used the President Clinton's affair with a
former White House intern to bash Boxer early in the race, is now
seeking to weaken her by linking her to labor unions and trial
lawyers, who have been among the largest contributors to her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon Wednesday at the San Jose Rotary Club, he accused
Boxer of siding with the trial lawyers who supported Proposition
211, a failed measure to allow shareholder lawsuits against
companies if their stock price plummeted. Many Silicon Valley
companies fought the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Boxer sided with labor union bosses in opposing
broader trade-negotiating powers for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Fong is counting on supporters like Helen Buckholtz, a Portola
Valley Republican, who said she supports Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a
Democrat, but won't vote for Boxer because she's ``too negative,
too partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's Central Valley campaign tour Thursday took her through
some areas where she has had little support in the past. In her
1992 election, her opponent, conservative television commentator
Bruce Herschensohn, out-polled her in several key Central Valley
counties: Fresno (55 percent to 37 percent), Merced (49 percent to
39 percent) and Madera (60 percent to 32 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A Public Policy Institute of California poll last week showed
Boxer trailing Fong in the more conservative Central Valley, but
had her in a dead heat with her Republican challenger statewide.

   The Senate Wednesday approved, 65-29, a $520 billion
appropriations bill that includes eight unresolved spending bills
to fund agencies for the fiscal year 1999. Among the items included
in the 3,825-page omnibus bill was $17.9 billion in funding for the
International Monetary Fund, $1.2 billion to hire new teachers, and
emergency funds for Bosnian peacekeeping missions and farmers.
Supporters said the bill funds necessary programs and the extra
expenditures come at a time when the federal government has a
surplus. Opponents criticized the closed process of arriving at the
budget compromise and said the proposals should have been openly
debated in Congress. Opponents also said the additional spending
compromises the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill. The president signed the bill into law Wednesday.

TEX-PHILES SEEK THE TRUTH ABOUT STATE'S GHOST TOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WE'RE NOT SURE, Texas _ This is truly where the streets have no
name.
</P>
<P>
   My dad and I are on an unmarked gravel road between Baird and
Putnam in West Texas. For the past half-hour, we've driven around,
searching for a ghost town called Callahan City.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't seen another car for about an hour. The closest town
is 30 minutes away. There's no one to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   We drive some more, torturing the tires of our car via this
snaking trail of sharp white rocks that's supposed to pass for a
road. At one point, we get out and walk, thinking we'll at least
see something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works sometimes: Driven by a desire to visit
these certain slices of Texas history before they rot away, my
father and I have been chasing ghost towns for years.
</P>
<P>
   Using T. Lindsay Baker's thorough ``Ghost Towns of Texas''
(University of Oklahoma Press) as our guide, we've searched for the
tiniest speck of former life at these deserted, desolate sites,
driving for hours to relish what usually amounts to very little: a
cemetery, an old sign, maybe a decaying barn. More than a few
times, we've found there simply isn't anything left, not even the
foundation of a building.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the path is deliberately blocked. An iron gate, for
example, guards the road leading to Haslam, supposedly one of the
most impressive ghost towns in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the good days when we stumble on a haven like
Silver, where an abandoned school sits shrouded in shrubbery.
Nearby, an elderly employee of a desolate, yet still active, post
office says wryly, ``We're not all dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Baker's book, there are more than 300 such
``ghost'' places in Texas, cities and towns that once bustled with
businesses, schools, churches and residents but that now sit silent
and forgotten, victims of getting bypassed by a railroad, tough
economic times or, simply enough, everyone just packing up and
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sites are well-marked, well-preserved and still
sparsely inhabited. Others are truly abandoned, their one-time
presence marked only by cemeteries, withering buildings or faded
historical markers. Both kinds are well worth visiting. Here is a
roundup of some of the more inspiring ghost towns within reasonable
driving distance from North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Grove
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: About 20 minutes southwest of Waco, The Grove
is on Farm Road 1114, less than a mile south of Texas 36 near its
intersection with Texas 236 in Coryell County.
</P>
<P>
   History: Named by early settlers for the trees that once covered
the site, The Grove boomed in the mid- to late 1800s. In 1874, a
post office was built; six years later, The Grove had three general
stores, a drugstore, a lumber yard, cafe and several other
businesses, as well as a school and a Lutheran church.
</P>
<P>
   Population remained solid until the 1940s, when a highway bypass
and agriculture consolidation (The Grove thrived on farming and
stock) slowly began to slit the town's wrists.
</P>
<P>
   What's left: A lot. The Grove has not been altogether deserted:
Several occupied homes surround the impressive stretch of old,
dusty buildings, one of which _ a general store that functions as a
museum _ is open on weekends. Aside from the store, still lingering
is a post office, an active church and a blacksmith shop. A
hand-dug public well anchors the picturesque area. This is the
ghost town featured on the cover of Baker's book.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Thurber
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Take Interstate 20 to its intersection with
Texas 108, about 35 miles west of Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   History: Once a prosperous mining community _ not to mention the
largest city between Fort Worth and El Paso _ Thurber has been
plagued to death. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1880s, engineer William Whipple White uncovered ore
deposits, quickly purchased several thousand acres of the land and
began large-scale mining operations. A miners strike in 1888 led to
his selling off the property to investors who formed the Texas and
Pacific Coal Co.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   To keep out the striking miners, the company founders wound a
barbed-wire fence around the area and practically built their own
city, which included an opera house, saloons, a 200-room hotel,
churches and schools. Their labor dispute settled, the miners
eventually settled in Thurber. At its peak, the city was home to
more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in 1917, though, when oil replaced coal as the fuel
of choice and, three years later, Thurber miners went on strike
again. Agreements could not be met and a year later, the mines were
closed. Finishing off Thurber was the closing of its brick kilns in
1933. The area has since been razed.
</P>
<P>
   What's left: A towering smokestack is visible from I-20. Nearby
are a handful of surviving buildings and several acres of
foundations. Even in its dilapidated state, tragedy struck again on
Jan. 15, 1992, when a fire broke out in one of the buildings that
housed a tourist hot spot, the Smokestack restaurant. Five months
later, it reopened.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Fort
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Take Farm Road 103 north from Nocona.
</P>
<P>
   History: Here, in 1759, a Spanish battalion clashed with the
Taovaya Indian tribe. The Indians had an advantage _ a fortified
village _ and slaughtered the Spanish troops. A century later,
white settlers found the remains of the village and mistook them
for a Spanish garrison. They named the area Spanish Fort.
</P>
<P>
   As a last stop for drovers on their way up the Chisholm Trail
before they crossed the Red River, Spanish Fort thrived throughout
the mid- to late 1800s. A post office was born in 1877. Soon came
schools, churches and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the railroad spelled the end for cattle drives
and, essentially, Spanish Fort. Even though a new school was built
in 1924, it was eventually abandoned, as was most of the town.
</P>
<P>
   What's left: Plenty _ two cemeteries, the 1924 school, deserted
gas stations and stores and a spooky town square that's anchored by
neglected park furniture and ominous historical markers
memorializing the 1759 battle scene. A faded general store and
scores of disheveled homes, a number of which are still occupied,
surround the square, magnifying the eeriness.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Belcherville
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Six miles west of Nocona on U.S. 82.
</P>
<P>
   History: In 1886, Belcherville was one of many Texas boom towns.
Land owners John and Alex Belcher had little problem selling plots
of land to excited pioneers. A railway line helped solidify the
town, but when the track was extended farther west toward
Henrietta, many residents left. A fire in 1893 wiped out what
little remained, but Belcherville has continued to quietly survive.
A few residents remain.
</P>
<P>
   What's left: Mazes of dirt roads, deserted structures and
several stone foundations, a handful of occupied homes.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Silver
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Twenty minutes south of Colorado City, Silver
is on Farm Road 1672 on a two-mile loop from Texas 208.
</P>
<P>
   History: Silver was established in the late 1880s, but didn't
grow until the 1940s, when oil was discovered nearby. By 1949, the
Sun Oil Co. had produced an oilfield and during the next several
years, the population shot up to 1,000. The oil company built
homes, adding to the schools and churches that already existed. A
strong sense of community ran through Silver, resulting in an
amateur baseball team, company picnics and various fund-raising
events. By the mid-'60s, the field had run dry, forcing Sun Oil to
cease operations there.
</P>
<P>
   What's left: Silver has returned to its roots: a small, quiet
town with only a few buildings, the most impressive _ and haunting
_ of which is the large school. Its shell is covered by trees and
shrubs, but you can still make out the gym, classrooms and offices.
Unseen but eerily noisy, mice dart in and out of the looming
structure. At least we hope we're hearing mice.

ISUZU AMIGO SO COMPLETELY REVAMPED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE CHANGED
THE NAME
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New doesn't always equate to better, but it certainly does in
the case of the revised Isuzu Amigo,
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu revived this two-door, half-soft-top sport-utility vehicle
for 1998, redesigning it so that virtually nothing remains of the
previous model, which was discontinued after the 1994 model year.
</P>
<P>
   What we have today is so much better than its predecessor that
Isuzu probably should have chosen a new name, too. The previous
model, based on a rough compact-truck chassis, was too cramped for
passenger comfort, too anemic for sustained interstate cruising,
and too bouncy for either on- or off-road driving. In short, it was
a rather crude attempt at building a Jeep Wrangler alternative, and
its only redeeming values were its beefy styling and low price _
about $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new Amigo overcomes the problems of the older one, primarily
because it's a shortened, two-door version of Isuzu's excellent
four-door Rodeo sport-utility wagon, which also was completely
redesigned for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And if you still want cheap, you can get a basic
two-wheel-drive, 130-horsepower four- cylinder Amigo model with no
luxury amenities (such as air-conditioning and power windows) for
about $15,000 _ not much higher than the original and still a much
better vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want the best package, including four-wheel drive and
a beast of a V-6 engine (cranking out a whopping 205 horsepower and
214 foot-pounds of torque, you'll have to pay close to the $24,007
sticker of our test vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen inches were chopped from the Rodeo's length to make the
new Amigo. The soft top covers the rear third of the vehicle, while
the rest of the roof is hard. There is a removable sun roof over
the driver and front passenger, however, so with that and the soft
top taken off, the Amigo is almost a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Isuzu is making a hard-top version available. The top
is technically removable, but is best left in place. It is not an
option on the soft-top model; it's only available as a separate
model.
</P>
<P>
   Only a five-speed manual transmission was offered on '98 models,
and that's what was on our test vehicle. For 1999, however, a
four-speed automatic will be available with the V-6 engine. For
off-roading, the automatic is the best choice, which is why Isuzu
decided to make it available as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, the new Amigo is a quite pleasurable cruiser,
especially with the 3.2- liter V-6 engine. There is more zip here
than in the competing Wrangler 4.0-liter six-cylinder, and handling
is much more carlike than the Wrangler's.
</P>
<P>
   The front double-wishbone and rear five-link suspension system
gives the Amigo a really smooth ride. Inside, there is lots of room
for two full-size adults up front, the bucket seats are
comfortable, and unlike the original Amigo, there is room to
stretch the legs out.
</P>
<P>
   In the rear, there is 13 inches more leg room than before, and
there is room for three adults, although not three hefty adults _
more like two adults and a kid, or three good-size kids. Still,
this is a great improvement over its predecessor, whose rear seat
was only good enough for a couple of small children or a big dog.
</P>
<P>
   Off the road, the four-wheel-drive V-6 Amigo is a serious
contender when matched with a stock Wrangler. There is 12 inches of
ground clearance, and the fuel tank and radiator are protected
underneath by galvanized steel plates.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike before, the four-wheel-drive system engages
electronically with the touch of a dashboard button, and the hubs
lock automatically. That means you don't have to get out of the
vehicle and turn the hub locks manually. As most avid off-roaders
know, that gets tiresome when you have to do it after you get stuck
in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   The Amigo has a two-speed transfer case for shifting into low
range to climb or descend steep hills or to make it through rough
spots, something that competing compact sport utilities such as the
Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V don't offer. The transfer case is
operated by a shift lever in the center floor console next to the
gear shift.
</P>
<P>
   While the four-cylinder engine might be suitable for basic
driving, I heartily recommend the V-6, which is available only in
four-wheel-drive models. This 24-valve, four-cam powerplant makes a
huge difference in the Amigo's on- and off-road performance, but
it's almost essential for cross-country cruising at highway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   I have only a few minor complaints about the Amigo. The soft top
has side and rear windows that unzip from the outside, making
anything left inside the vehicle easy prey for thieves; side-rear
visibility is limited by the large ``C'' pillars, those panels just
to the front of the removable soft top; and the silly little
center-high-mounted rear stop lamp sticks up just behind the spare
tire on the swing-out tailgate, limiting the driver's view to the
rear. The thing looks like the head of ``E.T'' (the
Extraterrestrial) when seen through the rearview mirror (in
fairness, this same E.T. head appears on the Toyota RAV4, too).
Also, the vehicle picks up some wind and road noise through the
soft top, which is to be expected; I would recommend the hard top
for both added security and lessened noise.
</P>
<P>
   The tailgate swings out to the left, carrying the spare tire
with it, a convenient feature to better facilitate loading and
unloading of cargo. The tailgate can even be opened with the soft
top in place.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel-drive model with V-6 engine and five-speed manual
transmission lists for $19,398 plus $495 transportation. The Amigo
and the Rodeo are built at the Isuzu/Subaru factory in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features for that price include power-assisted
four-wheel anti lock disc brakes, speed-sensitive power
rack-and-pinion steering, stainless-steel exhaust system, dual
front air bags, dual outside mirrors, reclining front bucket seats,
fold-down rear seat (that increases cargo space to more than 60
cubic feet), floor carpeting, cloth seats, center console, tilt-up
and removable sun roof, tinted windows, mud flaps and a full-size
spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   For $2,300 extra, our test vehicle came with a
preferred-equipment package that added air-conditioning, cruise

 &HT;    THE MICROSOFT TRIAL: IRONIES ABOUND AMID A CLASH OF CULUTRES
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-LAWYERS and MICROSOFT-JUDGE. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like a white-thatched Buddha, Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson sits on the bench in his black robes presiding in U.S.
District Court over a case summoned by his clerk as ``Civil Action
No. 98-1232, the United States of America vs. Microsoft Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   At the widely watched antitrust trial, John Warden, Microsoft's
lead lawyer, suspended his dogged cross-examination of the
government's star witness to note, ``I do all of my own work with a
fountain pen and a legal pad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had been taking copious notes with his fountain pen
on a legal pad, looked up and allowed a brief smile of recognition
to cross his normally impassive face.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the irony, the attorney for the world's biggest
software company put e-mail exhibits into the trial record with an
overhead projector that yielded fuzzy images that often couldn't be
read by the 80 spectators seated on wooden benches in the small
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, David Boies, the government's $300-an-hour hired gun,
deftly used razzle-dazzle computer blowups of e-mail messages to
and from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates to charge that Microsoft
violated the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act by willfully expanding its
monopoly over operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own low-tech preferences, Warden dubbed the
proceedings in Jackson's courtroom the ``return of the Luddites,''
citing the 19th century band of Englishmen who smashed machines
``to arrest the march of progress driven by science and
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To defend Microsoft's version of an industrial revolution,
Warden cited a message that Netscape Communications Corp. chief Jim
Barksdale had relayed to his troops after a June 4, 1995, meeting
with key Microsoft executives at the software giant's sprawling
campus in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude: very friendly, non-threatening,'' Barksdale,
Netscape's business-tested president and chief executive officer,
reported in a message labeled ``confidential'' and ``attorney
client privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys at Netscape have done a great job ... how can we work
together,'' Barksdale summarized the Microsoft comments, adding
that he was told the discussion took place with ``Bill's
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale testified that less than three weeks later, in a
reciprocal session at Netscape's Silicon Valley boardroom,
Microsoft threatened to ``kill'' Netscape by drawing a line around
its then-new Windows 95 operating system and the free Internet
browsing tool it buried deep within the proprietary Windows code.
</P>
<P>
   It is that exchange _ which Microsoft denies ever took place _
that serves as the nexus of the case against Microsoft filed last
May by the Department of Justice and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   But in a broad sense, the case revolves around two antithetical
views of the Information Age society as it hurtles toward the third
millennium. The ironies behind the courtroom props aside, a true
cultural clash permeates this trial, which enters its second week
on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government sees Microsoft's efforts to get its ``business
partners'' to support its core products _ and, in Netscape's case,
to shun the Windows browser market _ as a clear violation of the
antitrust laws. But Microsoft contends that it's common practice in
the fast-paced industry for firms to work together and compete
against each other at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government alleges that Microsoft has leveraged its huge
market power to force personal computer makers to give it top
billing on opening screens. But Microsoft contends it has a right
to protect its products by asking distributors to feature them in
an unmodified state.
</P>
<P>
   _ In giving its browser away as part of its Windows software,
the government says Microsoft intends to cripple its competitors.
But Microsoft contends bundling products is an accepted industry
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopolies have to be held to a different standard because
they have monopoly power,'' antitrust chief Joel Klein told a
gathering of computer industry leaders a day after the trial began.
By and large, the Supreme Court has found that conduct that could
be seen as innocent when engaged in by a competitor even with large
market share may be illegal when engaged in by a true monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, whose $52 billion in Microsoft stock makes him the
world's richest man, views the antitrust blitz against the firm he
co-founded in 1986 as illogical in terms of his world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates is the ultimate programming machine,'' says computer
guru Stewart Alsop. ``He believes everything can be defined,
examined, reduced to essentials, and rearranged into a logical
sequence that will achieve a particular goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that doesn't work this way, anything illogical, is
'random.' In the world of Bill Gates, being illogical is the most
serious sin.''
</P>
<P>
   In league with his wealthy client, Warden told the court that
monopolies can't exist in the digital realm where traditional
barriers to entry, such as huge factories, don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   All any new entrant needs, he asserted, is a good set of brains,
some startup funds and a computer. ``This is no comfortable or
quiet monopolist backwater,'' he asserted. If it were, he said,
Microsoft wouldn't be spending $3 billion a year on research.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a continent away from the trial, a small firm named
Mobile Insights announced a new all-purpose gizmo: an electrtonic
pen and tablet to replace yellow legal pads for note-taking. While
it's doubtful whether either Jackson or Warden will use it, the new
unit is slated to run on Microsoft's Windows CE operating system.

does in the case of the revised Isuzu Amigo. Isuzu revived this
two-door, half-soft-top sport-utility vehicle for 1998, redesigning
it so that virtually nothing remains of the previous model, which
was discontinued after the 1994 model year. What we have today is
so much better than its predecessor that Isuzu probably should have

``Ghost Towns of Texas'' (University of Oklahoma Press) as our
guide, we've searched for the tiniest speck of former life at these

JOHN GLENN: A HERO RETURNS TO SPACE 
 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grand Central Station stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, in living rooms around the globe, were glued to
radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   And outside John Glenn's childhood home in New Concord, Ohio,
concerned friends and neighbors and hundreds of anxious reporters
waited on shifting feet, ruining Clara Glenn's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several minutes of nothing,'' remembers Lloyd
White, Glenn's best buddy since third grade and best man at his
wedding. ``The whole town was out there and we didn't know if he
was burnin' up or what.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, Alan Shepard forced a calm tone, repeatedly
calling his fellow astronaut: ``Friendship 7, this is Mercury
Control. How do you read? Over.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a communications blackout of four minutes, 20
seconds, during which the world prayed that the capsule's heat
shield had held, a familiar, enthusiastic voice pierced the static:
``Loud and clear. How me?''
</P>
<P>
   The control center sighed in relief; the crowd in Ohio erupted
in cheers. The first American in space asked the first American to
orbit the Earth: ``How are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, pretty good,'' replied the grand master of understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day _ Feb. 20, 1962 _ America has never been the
same. And John Glenn, the first of us to snap a picture of the
Earth from space, the first to witness four sunsets in one day, and
the last, some have said, of the great American heroes, has barely
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it showed on him at all,'' says Rex Hoon, who
has known Glenn since he was making model airplanes in grade
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been one to overestimate his importance,'' agrees
Harold Kaser, who went to church with Glenn as a boy and played
football with him in college. ``He's just a good, ordinary
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like the people who know John Glenn, the fighter pilot,
the astronaut, the millionaire, the politician and, now, the
astronaut again, as a nice, smart kid from a sensible Presbyterian
family whom everyone in town called ``Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of America, John Herschel Glenn Jr. is anything but
ordinary. And as the 77-year-old retiring senator prepares for his
long-awaited second space voyage &UR;  &LR; this week, his hero status
appears as solid as it was four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a time when NASA launches the space shuttle six or seven
times a year, when construction is about to begin on an
international space station, and when millions have seen images of
the Martian surface beamed home by the robot Sojourner, the average
person on the street would be hard-pressed to name a single current
astronaut or more than a couple of the 12 men who have walked on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they continue to embrace Glenn, who spent only five years
with NASA and logged less than five hours in space. His ticker-tape
parade down Wall Street still holds the record for the most paper
flung from New York City skyscrapers. His space capsule sits in the
Smithsonian beside the Wright Brothers' plane and Charles
Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. His fan mail has barely let up,
and he can't walk from point A to point B without someone
requesting an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn's launch approaches, authorities in Florida are bracing
for an onslaught of beach campers around Cape Canaveral. Motels and
trailer parks near Kennedy Space Center have been booked since last
spring, &UR;  &LR; and Mattel is introducing John Glenn action figures (one
dressed as a senator, one as an astronaut) and a toy Friendship 7
capsule. And while Glenn implores his fellow crew members to call
him ``just John'' and insists his only mission aboard Discovery
will be scientific research on aging, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
has declared Glenn his personal hero. He concedes he's counting on
the aging senator to remind Americans ``that this is a nation where
we take on bold tasks and are not afraid of risk, that this is a
place where dreams come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Glenn took his position atop the Atlas rocket in his
tiny spacecraft 36 years ago, he was considered a hero by many who
saw him as the ideal American: a polite, straight-laced kid from
rural Ohio who honored his schoolteacher mother and his plumber
father.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps veteran of World War II and Korea had flown 149
combat missions and, in the last nine days of fighting, shot down
three Russian MiGs along the Yalu River, earning numerous medals.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he continued to risk his life as a test pilot and
in July 1957, he made the first transcontinental flight to average
supersonic speed, flying from Los Angeles to New York in three
hours, 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His selection in 1959 as one of the seven Mercury astronauts
would by itself have secured him a healthy reference in American
history books.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could have predicted what Goldin now calls one of
America's ``defining moments.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Glenn climbed out of his capsule that day and watched
a crewman paint the outline of his space boots on the deck of the
rescue ship Noa, it was clear he was stepping into a new world.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the enormity of what Glenn had accomplished was
incomprehensible to those still in awe of Lucky Lindy's 1927 solo
nonstop flight across the Atlantic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's friend Kaser remembers that in the days following the
orbital flight he couldn't stop thinking about his parents' horse
and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me longer to go to town and back as a kid than it took
John to circle the Earth three times,'' he says. ``That's how far
we had come in such a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Russians had beaten Glenn into orbit. To
Americans, that could not have been more beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the United States had a fighting chance of
catching up in the Space Race and fulfilling President Kennedy's
pledge of being first to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   And Glenn, that smiling, redheaded, freckle-faced, all-American
boy next door, became the ultimate symbol of what a free country
could do if it tried hard enough. The dream doors were flung wide
open as Glenn encouraged children to do their homework and inspired
future space voyagers and scientists to explore the great unknown,
seek out beings from other worlds, colonize Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a hero, you have to have a cause and stand up for it,''
says Kaser. ``You have to have certain principles to defend and
promote. You have to have an interest in what's good, not just for
yourself, but for other people. You give of yourself relentlessly
and wholeheartedly. You know yourself and you know what you stand
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is all of those things and more,'' he says. ``Some people
have even said John is the last true American hero. I do not agree.
I think there will be others _ I hope there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that hope, in an age when countless sports figures, movie
stars and rock singers soar to hero status one minute only to be
toppled the next, is what prompts Americans to cling to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra says heroes may have been
easier to create in the early days of the space program, when
American society was more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did dumb things, like getting traffic tickets, or racing
down the Gulf Freeway in Corvettes,'' Schirra recalls of his days
in Houston. ``But I think the public was more understanding than
they are today. I mean they tear people apart so fast (now) it's
unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard for a kid to pick up a hero because I'm not
sure what generates a hero these days,'' he says. ``There are
heroic things done by firemen, policemen, lifesavers _ all kinds of
events like that. But they're dropped within hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason John Glenn the hero has survived so long _
weathering the relatively minor storms of the Keating Five scandal
and a disastrous run for the presidency that left him holding a
multimillion-dollar campaign debt _ is that Americans continue to
view him as an ordinary guy who did his best and accomplished
extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   History books cite his achievements in space and in politics,
but his friends point to his devotion to his wife and children, and
to the fact that he's never forgotten where he came from. Glenn
says he keeps his dad's plumbing wrench on his Senate office desk
to remind him of his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He and Annie frequently fly home to New Concord to see how the
high school football team is doing, to shake hands with
fourth-graders promoted to middle school and to join friends for
hot fudge sundaes at their favorite ice cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he has contributed an enormous amount to his country,
and that will be the thing that stands out,'' says Sam Speck,
president of Muskingum College, the Glenns' alma mater in New
Concord where they now serve on the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more than that, he took the best values from a rural
community, the idea of telling it like it is, of treating people
decently no matter who they are, of working hard, of loving your
fellow man and loving your country, of helping those less
fortunate,'' he says. ``He'll be remembered for living a life of
simple virtue in a time when simple virtue is often hard to come
by.''
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn himself is posed the hero question, he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm the same person who grew up in New Concord,'' he
says. ``I don't wake up every morning thinking, `I gotta be a hero
today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't me,'' he adds. ``It would have been the same if it
had been ... anyone on that particular flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps he explained the John Glenn phenomenon years ago. In
``My Own Story of the Orbit,'' published by Life magazine in the
spring of 1962, the 40-year-old astronaut reflected on the
overwhelming throngs greeting him upon his return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked at all those faces and waved and smiled, when I
really felt much more,'' he wrote. ``Here they were, identifying
with me, and I was identifying with them _ right back.'' &QL;

CHANGING COURSE: WITH THE COLD WAR LONG THAWED, NASA HAS FOUND A
NEW FOCUS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The embryonic NASA of John Glenn's heyday as a Mercury astronaut
in the early 1960s pushed the envelope of human spaceflight, boldly
teaching itself to pilot in a treacherous new realm and eventually
to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged space program of today has long retreated from
the lunar frontier and focused itself instead on filling the gap
between the Earth and moon with a less glamorous international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   The two very different eras converge late this month when Glenn,
now 77 and in the twilight of a lengthy U.S. Senate career, soars
once again into space for a nine-day mission aboard the space
shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn made history when he became the first
American to orbit the Earth, his only flight in five years with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. His encore will make
him by far humanity's oldest emissary in space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's solo Mercury flight established that an astronaut could
cope with a nervous system turned upside down in the absence of
gravity, retain sharpness of vision and be able to make decisions
necessary to control and fly a spacecraft into unexplored
territory.
</P>
<P>
   With his second flight, Glenn plans to again play the role of
medical subject, though not pilot, on behalf of an emerging
scientific premise that there is a medical link between the
physical stresses of space flight and those of aging.
</P>
<P>
   His latest contribution, the senator believes, may awaken an
aging national populace to the need for more research into the
ailments shared temporarily by healthy young astronauts and the
elderly. They include weakened immune and cardiovascular systems,
brittle bones, balance disorders and trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go back up,'' Glenn said in January as his
four-year, behind-the-scenes campaign in Washington to fly again
bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Cheered by the throngs who lined New York's Wall Street for a
ticker-tape parade and by a joint session of Congress after his
three orbits of the Earth, Glenn believes his hero status prevented
him from taking another mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming, a shock almost,'' Glenn said of the
outpouring that dwarfed anything that contemporary shuttle crews
receive. ``There would be people crying along the street, sobbing
and wiping their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tenuous times we were living in, the competition
with the Soviets,'' Glenn said of the early '60s-era
boisterousness. ``We look at that now and think, oh well, the
Soviets are down the tubes and that was bound to happen. But we did
not know that then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dog-eat-dog,'' Glenn recalled. ``Americans had begun to
doubt themselves as far as leadership in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   America's space program sprung to life in the aftermath of the
October 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, by
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was striding toward a decade of political
assassination, racial strife and protracted combat in Southeast
Asia. The threat of nuclear annihilation from a face-off between
the United States and the communist Soviet regime loomed profoundly
over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Soviets could launch a satellite on a rocket, they could
replace it with an atomic bomb aimed at the United States,
policy-makers reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the economy was robust as America entered the
1960s. The three-martini lunch was fashionable. Families gathered
before their televisions to watch ``Wagon Train'' and ``Bonanza,''
a pair of westerns whose themes celebrated a vibrant, young nation
settling its rugged frontier. On the dance floor, the rage was the
Twist, an aerobic oscillation in which the participants went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this invigorating chaos, the United States was also going
to the moon. Unprecedented in its risk and ambition, the expedition
was intended to reveal a national might and grace greater than its
superpower rival.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade of the '60s opened, the United States was clearly
behind in the space race. The Soviets followed their success with
Sputnik by launching the first human, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who
circled the Earth once on April 12, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   America's first space traveler, the late Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
followed Gagarin less than a month later with a more modest
suborbital lob that spanned just 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, then-President John F. Kennedy spoke to Congress,
directing the nation to place an astronaut on the moon by the end
of the decade. The goal was achieved in July 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The program was called Apollo and was structured to build on the
accomplishments of Glenn and his Mercury colleagues and those who
participated in a second program called Gemini.
</P>
<P>
   The moon quest galvanized America. Kennedy battled with
lawmakers for the privilege of increasing NASA funding, not cutting
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment was one of anticipation, expectancy and one of
doubt; one of wanting proof the United States could compete with
the Russians in space,'' said Christopher Kraft, who served as the
NASA flight director for Glenn's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tremendous days, particularly the flight of John
Glenn,'' he said. ``There was a tremendous feeling of
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (shuttle) flight of John Glenn has rekindled a spark that
was there a long time ago. He has inspired people,'' Kraft said.
``They are inspired by his intestinal fortitude. No matter how
trite that might seem, it's true.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the Cold War long over, the competition that once
justified large federal expenditures on space is absent. As
inheritor of the old Soviet space program, Russia has worked with
the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada for the the
construction of a new orbiting laboratory that would specialize in
the kinds of medical studies and other kinds of research that Glenn
now champions.
</P>
<P>
   While NASA's feisty administrator, Dan Goldin, urges his
employees to think, ``faster, better, cheaper,'' first the White
House, then Congress cuts the agency's annual spending. In
response, NASA labors to keep its pledge of a new station afloat as
its financially strapped Russian partners struggle to meet crucial
commitments to its success.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet and then Russian influence that winds through four
decades of U.S. space objectives frustrates many of NASA's
strongest supporters, who think the agency has become too much an
arm of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s, we were storming heaven. We had a space program
that was going someplace,'' said Robert Zubrin, a 46-year-old
Colorado-based engineer, author and space activist.  &UR;  &LR; His
fourth-grade class watched on television 37 years ago as Kennedy
announced plans for a human expedition to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   He and his schoolmates tuned in again as Glenn lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to be on the moon by 1970. We were going to be
on Mars by 1980. We would be on our way to the stars by the turn of
the century,'' Zubrin recalls. ``It was an incredible invitation to
adventure to every kid in the country. Learn your science and you
could become part of pioneering many new worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly bought into that, and I think millions of young
people of my generation did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building a space station is not bold enough for Zubrin, whose
passion is Mars.
</P>
<P>
   His 1996 book, ``The Case for Mars'' lays out a rationale for a
10-year effort to reach the Red Planet with American explorers and
then colonize it. Zubrin proposes a low-cost effort that would
exploit the resources available on Mars to produce life support,
food and rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The book also includes a political strategy for obtaining a
presidential commitment after the turn of the century. Unless
America, either on its own or with the most capable international
partners, begins to colonize space, its past accomplishments are
likely to become no more than historical footnotes, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin is among a dozen serious contestants for the X-Prize, a
$10 million offering to the first privately financed team to launch
humans into space with a reusable rocket. As a small aerospace
contractor to NASA, he is developing equipment for future unmanned
Mars probes that could demonstrate a capability to produce rocket
fuel from the planet's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe, however, that it takes more than the inspiration
that surrounded Kennedy's call to the moon during the early 1960s
to sustain human space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War nearly a decade ago unalterably changed
the equation for its justification, contends Alex Roland, who
chairs Duke University's History Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apollo program worked magnificently as Cold War
propaganda,'' said Roland, who worked as a NASA historian during
the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole space program, and the reason for putting astronauts
in space at all, was part of the Cold War struggle. A lot was
riding on it,'' Roland recalled. ``If (the Soviets) really could do
things in this exciting realm sooner and better than we could, the
suggestion was that the Red Star might be rising.''
</P>
<P>
   With its victory, America may have lost the principal
justification for further investment in human space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is now all by itself in pioneering this
field. That adds weight to the question of what is the urgency?''
said Roland. ``Does it make any difference whether we have a space
station now or 30 years from now, whether we sent people to Mars
now or 50 years from now or 100 years from now?
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot make a compelling case why we have to spend this
money now,'' he said. ``Your budget gets eroded and that
fundamentally is what has happened to NASA.'' &QL;

GROWING WINGS: FROM HIS RURAL OHIO ROOTS, GLENN WAS ALWAYS A
STANDOUT 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CONCORD, Ohio _ Forget that Boy Scout image you read about.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it may actually be true that the legendary John Glenn _
first American to orbit the Earth, decorated veteran of two wars,
millionaire businessman and four-term U.S. senator _ doesn't drink,
smoke, fight or cuss.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts weren't good enough for Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kinda rowdy,'' remembers Lloyd White, Glenn's
lifelong friend. ``So Johnny and I started our own club when we
were 11 or 12. About every kid in town was in it. We got together
and had a big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glenn's strict, Presbyterian, dry (then and now) hometown _
population 2,000 _ a big time for the Ohio Rangers consisted of
swimming in the Muskingum River, sleeping out in tents and making
model airplanes every chance they got. To earn merit badges, they
waded through knee-deep snow and climbed 80-foot trees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 77, with about half of his high school classmates and
nearly half of his Mercury astronaut buddies gone, Glenn is still
climbing. On Thursday, he is scheduled to take his second ride into
the great unknown, becoming the oldest human in space and, NASA
hopes, igniting memories of his glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to go back up again,'' Glenn says, ``but as
the years went by, I thought those hopes had gone glimmering a long
time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The section of Interstate 40 that connects Cambridge _ where
Glenn was born on July 18, 1921 _ and New Concord _ where he moved
with his parents a couple of years later _ is known as the John H.
Glenn Highway. The street by Glenn's boyhood home is named
Friendship Drive after his space capsule; the local high school and
the gym at the college are named for him.
</P>
<P>
   New Concord is an idyllic rural village about 75 miles east of
Columbus. It's a place where, White says, ``everybody in town is
your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No smoking, no drinking, no dancing, no cards,'' White
remembers. ``It was a great place for kids to be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice little town, but it wasn't the sticks,'' says
Lorle Porter, a local historian at Muskingum College, Glenn's
Presbyterian alma mater. ``There were lots of missionaries who had
been all over the world, coming home. There was more of a
cosmopolitan atmosphere than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, Glenn, whom everyone called ``Bud'' or
``Johnny'' to separate him from his dad, the local plumber and car
dealer, earned extra money on a paper route and raised rhubarb to
sell from a wagon.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Glenn's grades were good, but not outstanding.
His mother, a former teacher, thought he could do better if he
devoted a little less time to socializing and sports. A star center
on the football team, Glenn was the only athlete in his high school
to letter in three sports _ football, basketball and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of his junior class, had the lead in the senior
play, and sang tenor in the glee club. Every Memorial Day, Glenn's
father, a World War I bugler, performed Taps at the local cemetery.
John stood on the bridge near his home and played the echo on his
trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1939 yearbook, Glenn was dubbed ``busiest'' and
``all-around popular boy.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Glenn begged his parents to stop at the airport to
watch takeoffs and landings. He took his first airplane ride when
he was 8 or 9, sitting next to his dad in the back of a small
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up and circled around Cambridge, Ohio,'' he remembers.
``I was fascinated with flying from then on and I built model
airplanes as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Glenn's hobby threatened to lead him into a dangerous
profession, his parents balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sick when he took up aviation,'' Glenn's father would
later tell the Columbus Dispatch. ``It was just like taking him out
and burying him, we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years, when Glenn became a test pilot, he would fly his
jet home. John and Clara Glenn would hear him buzz New Concord,
signaling them to pick him up at the airport in nearby Zanesville.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors to the town often stop the police, whose
uniforms include a Friendship 7 patch on the shoulder, to ask
directions to the John Glenn museum, Porter says. There isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't call attention to yourself here,'' she says.
``That's bragging. It's not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is the same. ``It's still hard to get it in his head that
we want to do a John Glenn museum. That shocks him.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same guy who shot up both hands when reporters asked
which of the original seven astronauts would be first in space? And
sent his physical exams to NASA every year since retirement? And
lobbied relentlessly for a second ride?``
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go from selling rhubarb to where he is unless you're
ambitious,'' Porter says. ``With the outside world, pressing
himself forward is OK, but this is his home.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Johnny Glenn and Anna Margaret Castor, the
daughter of the town dentist, were engaged in the crib.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a time in our lives when we didn't know
each other,'' Glenn told Columbus Monthly magazine this summer.
``Everything we've been through, we've been through together.''
</P>
<P>
   They were actually engaged while attending Muskingum. It looked
like John might graduate from college and settle down with Annie,
maybe eventually take over his dad's plumbing business.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 7, 1941, John was on his way to Annie's senior
recital when he heard on the radio that the Japanese had bombed
Pearl Harbor. After she played ``Be Still My Soul'' on the organ,
he told her he was joining up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Glenn, who already had his private pilot's
license, enlisted in military flight training and was sent to
Corpus Christi, Texas. As soon as he earned his wings and was
commissioned into the Marines, he took a train home and married
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all dressed up in his Marine uniform,'' recalls White,
who served as Glenn's best man in 1943. ``He looked at me and said,
`What do you think of this ol' clown suit?' I can still see him
standing there with a great big grin on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   He flew 59 missions in the South Pacific during World War II and
requested combat duty again during the Korean conflict. By then,
the Glenns had two children, Dave and Lyn, whose names were painted
on his F-86 Sabrejet along with Annie's. He flew 63 missions with
the Marines and another 27 as an exchange pilot with the Air Force.
He received the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and was
awarded the Air Medal with 18 clusters.
</P>
<P>
   After combat duty, he moved his family to the Washington, D.C.,
area so he could become a test pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1957, he flew from Los Angeles to New York in three
hours, 23 minutes _ the first transcontinental flight to average
supersonic speed. During the flight, he laid a supersonic boom over
his hometown, prompting phone calls to his parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny must have dropped a bomb,'' a neighbor lady told his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, Glenn was picked off a New York street
by a TV recruiter to appear on CBS-TV's ``Name That Tune'' paired
with a 10-year-old fellow redhead, Eddie Hodges. They shared a
$26,000 jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess looking back, he stood out,'' White says of
Glenn's early career. ``But we never thought he'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was becoming an astronaut. Glenn was the oldest
of the Mercury team, and he was considered the front-runner in a
friendly competition among the seven astronauts to be first in
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really disappointed that he didn't get chosen,'' White
says.
</P>
<P>
   But while Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom blasted off ahead of him,
Glenn drew the mission that would make him the first American to
circle the globe. The orbital flight, Feb. 20, 1962, was the day
Americans became convinced they could catch the Russians in the
great space race.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 40-year-old Glenn was finally launched, there
had been 11 delays; he had suited up four times, spending several
hours waiting in his tiny capsule before the mission was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to get the thing going,'' Glenn recalls.
``People think somehow that you're under such great tension, that
you're suffering some way, or that you're almost looking at this as
a suicide mission or something, and it wasn't that way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One such delay, on Jan. 27, 1962, has become as much a part of
NASA lore as Shepard's hitting a golf ball on the surface of the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The story, made famous by Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff''
and the movie by the same name, begins as Glenn waits in his
capsule at Cape Canaveral and quickly flashes to the front lawn of
the Glenn home in Arlington, Va., where the media has descended,
hoping for a word from the worried wife.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn, who has struggled with a severe stutter since
childhood, is terrified at the thought of stammering on national
TV.
</P>
<P>
   After the launch is canceled, the vice president of the United
States demands to come inside the house, cameras in tow, to comfort
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   She refuses to open the door.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyndon Johnson curses, word goes back to Florida: Get John
Glenn on the line to order his wife to play ball. Instead, Glenn
picks up the phone and tells Annie she doesn't have to open the
door to anybody. ``And I will back you up all the way, 100
percent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn has since overcome her disability. Earlier this
year, as John and Annie celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary,
Glenn told reporters the secret to their happy marriage was
learning to stand by each other in hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what partnership is all about,'' he said. ``It can't
all be ticker-tape parades.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Glenn's first mission was to put a man into orbit
and see if the human body could endure weightlessness for a few
hours. The science was basic: Glenn read an eye chart periodically
to make sure the shape of his eyeballs wasn't changing, affecting
his vision. He ate a squeeze tube of applesauce and kept it down.
</P>
<P>
   After one of seven planned revolutions, the capsule began to
drift. He took over manual control from the autopilot and was
actually flying the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The test was cut off after three orbits by ground controllers
worried that an inflatable cushioning device between the capsule's
aft bulkhead and its heat shield had deployed prematurely. The
world held its breath, hoping the heat shield had remained in
place, as Glenn made a fiery descent back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   After splashing down in the Atlantic near Grand Turk Island, a
NASA psychiatrist asked Glenn to fill out a form that ended with
the question: ``Was there any unusual activity during this
period?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't resist it,'' Glenn said. ``No, I wrote, just a
normal day in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after meeting the Kennedys, riding in victory parades and
delivering a speech before a joint session of Congress, Glenn
seemed relatively unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenns returned to New Concord for a parade that drew about
75,000 revelers. As the high school band played ``When Johnny Comes
Marching Home,'' John and Annie rode through town in a convertible,
waving and calling out to all their old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my kids said, `He called you by your nickname!' and I
said, `Of course. He knows me,' '' says Harold Kaser, who went to
Glenn's church and played football with him at Muskingum. ``They
were very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was a private _ town only _ reception at
Muskingum's new gymnasium that would be named for the astronaut.
Each family on the local gas meter list got two tickets. A speaker
introduced John Glenn as ``the embodiment of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, his friends insist, John Glenn didn't change a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we changed,'' says White. ``When he was an astronaut, I
didn't really know how to handle it. I felt like he was untouchable
almost. But that was a sensation in me. He was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he became a senator,'' White adds, ``then I felt more
comfortable _ like he was a human being now, not a God.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's political career brought early disappointments. Before
his first run for the U.S. Senate got off the ground in 1964, Glenn
slipped and fell, hitting his head and causing dizziness that put
him in the hospital for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually retired from the Marines and settled in Houston,
where he worked as a NASA consultant and as an executive with Royal
Crown Cola, a job that made him a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he ran for the Senate again and was defeated in the
primary. On his third attempt four years later, however, he carried
all 88 counties in Ohio, and in 1980, was re-elected with the
largest margin in state history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Glenn made a run for the presidency that many describe
as disastrous. The candidate summed it up this way: ``I humiliated
my family, gained 16 pounds and went millions of dollars into debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``it was an exhilarating experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the campaign debt and the fallout from a scandal
in which Glenn was investigated but never charged over questionable
campaign contributions from convicted savings and loan magnate
Charles Keating, Glenn's friends have urged him to retire and come
home.
</P>
<P>
   But when Glenn does retire from politics in January, he will
have served 24 years and will leave a nearly spotless record of
leading the Senate in technical and scientific matters, of helping
prevent the spread of nuclear arms and of demanding the cleanup of
contamination at nuclear production plants.
</P>
<P>
   And he's been a dutiful ex-astronaut, says George Diller, a
spokesman for Kennedy Space Center, recalling Glenn's actions after
the Challenger explosion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Glenn got word of it, he could not get here fast
enough,'' Diller says. ``The fact that he showed up so fast showed
how much he still cared about this place. It was not lost on
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some have derided the upcoming flight as a political
payoff or a publicity stunt, many credit John Glenn for inspiring
their own careers and for his undying quest to push himself further
and farther.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn was coming up in little New Concord, Ohio, ``he
believed in a cause,'' says his friend Kaser. ``He wasn't aimless
or wandering around. He was always forward-thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's like that now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks to the future.'' &QL;

CLASS OF '59: SURVIVING MERCURY FRATERNITY BROTHERS VIEW GLENN'S
RIDE DIFFERENTLY 

</HEADLINE>

By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. _ For those who grew up in the '60s, the
names of the first astronauts had a magical quality _ Alan Shepard,
Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Wally Schirra, Scott Carpenter, Gordon
Cooper, Deke Slayton.
</P>
<P>
   They emerged at a time when Americans still believed we could do
just about anything. The nation wanted heroes, NASA needed them to
foster enthusiasm for the space program, and the men of the Mercury
program delivered the goods.
</P>
<P>
   With Glenn stirring memories of that glorious past as he
prepares for a return trip to outer space at age 77, the views of
his three surviving Mercury cohorts range from skepticism to envy
to enthusiastic support.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra, 75, shakes his head at the whole event, and says he
can't understand why any hotshot pilot would want to be a mere
passenger _ even in space. To ``get in the back'' as he puts it,
would be a little demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I told him, `Don't do that John _ you're going to
embarrass all your fellow test pilots for having given away your
command, essentially,' '' Schirra said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn may downplay the public relations benefits of the flight,
but Schirra is convinced that is NASA's reason for allowing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary, but I really think NASA needs the
publicity,'' Schirra said. ``And it's obvious ... it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper thinks the ``science angle'' has plenty of validity.
Glenn's flight is an unusual opportunity for the medical world, he
said, because of the baseline of information scientists have
available on the Ohio senator dating back to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us, all through the space program, nobody had ever
had the amount of physical scrutiny that we all had,'' Cooper said,
adding that many astronauts still go back to NASA for annual
physicals. ``So we've got a real long record of medical history on
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Carpenter both confess to being a little envious of
Glenn. And they'd strap themselves back onto a rocket in a red-hot
minute, front seat or back, if the destination were Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Are they too old? Clearly, they aren't ready to concede it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think of myself as old now, but I sure thought it
was old age when I was in my 30s,'' says Cooper, chuckling. At 71,
his walk is a little stiffer than the ``Gordo'' who was the
youngest of the Mercury fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, 73, wouldn't mind being the second elderly astronaut
behind Glenn, just as he was the second American in orbit behind
him. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think the opportunity John has to do some meaningful
scientific work is there,'' Carpenter said. ``And I envy him the
chance to do that. If something of lasting significance comes out
of it, we may fly other geriatrics like John, and I'll be first in
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the original class have died, the most recent
being Shepard, who passed on at age 74 this year after a long
battle with leukemia. Grissom, 40, was killed in the flash fire in
January 1967 that claimed the entire crew of Apollo 1 during
training. Slayton, who never flew a Mercury mission because of a
heart condition, succumbed to a brain tumor in 1993 at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   When you walk down the stairs into Schirra's Rancho Santa Fe
den, the memories from nearly 40 years ago return in waves of
photographs lining the walls. There are the seven astronauts being
introduced to the nation in 1959. There are the Kennedys. There are
the rockets, the impossibly tiny space capsules, the space suits.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra may poke fun at Glenn for pursuing ``one last ride,''
but his roomful of mementos demonstrates that he has never really
left the space program behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us haven't,'' Schirra said. ``You can't let loose of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke that Glenn was going back into space,
Schirra's phone began ringing and hasn't stopped. ``It's amazing
how it's caught the public's imagination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra says he has explained to Glenn in pretty plain terms
that he doesn't approve of his flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I
think there's some interest in aging,' '' Schirra recalled Glenn
saying. ``And I said, `Then why don't we talk about Story
Musgrave?' He's had five or six flights, and a lot of data.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave reluctantly retired from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in September 1997 at the ripe old age of 62,
after being told he was too old to fly any more missions.
</P>
<P>
   And while Glenn touts the value of studying the effects of
spaceflight on the elderly, Schirra is equally convinced that the
primary motivation is the joy of the flight itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more ride,'' Schirra said. ``I can't defend him on the
science angle. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``John went off into politics,'' Schirra said. ``So John,
obviously, from a political/PR standpoint got a flight. Whether he
earned it or not ... I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local joke they have at the country club here ... is why
don't they send Strom Thurmond up there if they want an old fogy?''
Schirra laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper contends that the flight presents an opportunity to
compare how Glenn's 77-year-old body will react to an orbital
situation similar to the one he experienced when he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch will be a lot easier and the reentry will be a lot
easier, but (it's an) almost identical orbital situation, except
he'll have a lot of room,'' Cooper said. ``It'll be interesting to
see what changes in the cardiovascular system there have been ...
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Even four decades ago some of the other Mercury astronauts were
never quite sure what to make of Glenn. Military men of the old
school didn't go in for publicity, but Glenn was drawn to
microphones and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, John was very astute at public relations, very
knowledgeable of it and enjoyed it,'' Cooper recalls. ''He didn't
miss an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And Glenn's gravitation toward the spotlight rubbed some of the
astronaut corps the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes there was some of that here and there,'' Cooper
said. ``There were a few who probably didn't enjoy his trying to be
the spokesperson for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it never bothered me much,'' Cooper continued.
``We were kind of like a bunch of brothers. We were then and we
still are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of us who didn't always agree with John,
but we agreed with him on most things. He's certainly a wonderful
person, you know, a great sense of humor. And we all razz one
another mercilessly _ whenever the opportunity arises,'' Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was practically canonized by the nation after his orbital
flight and something about his personality kept him slightly apart
from nearly everyone except his good friend Carpenter. He just
wouldn't ``cavort'' with the other guys, as Schirra put it.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter says he has no idea why his friendship with Glenn has
always been stronger than the others, adding, ``you choose your own
friends according to your own yardstick _ that's just the way it
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see each other frequently and the camaraderie and `esprit
de corps' endures,'' Carpenter said. He has no reservations about
Glenn making this flight, and can't judge the value of the public
relations it will generate.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is motivated by simple curiosity, Carpenter believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to bring back some new truths. That's what we all
want from experimental space flight like this. So I understand his
motivation very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says he gets the chance to talk to the current crop of
astronauts from time to time, and says some of them may be a little
envious of the strength of the space program that grew underneath
the original astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's very discouraging now to be an astronaut, when
you think of how ... little we are progressing in space,'' Cooper
said. ``We're going to wind up watching the Japanese or the Chinese
or the French go to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we will participate in an international space
station, which would be a great thing because it would bring
together a lot of countries.'' Cooper said. ``But we should already
be back on the moon with a permanent lunar base.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress continues to be very balky about funding the space
program, Cooper said. So he concludes that NASA can definitely use
whatever positive publicity is generated by Glenn's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has gone through all these big cycles,'' Cooper said.
``At the time of the Mercury and the Gemini programs, NASA was the
master of PR (public relations).
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've put out in the past 30 years has been garbage,
frankly,'' Cooper said. ``Midway through the lunar landings, NASA
decided they were the only game in town and didn't have to work
very hard at maintaining public support for the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the public interest has not waned, because every
day I get a stack of mail that high _ every single day, and every
one of us does,'' Cooper said. ``So that tells me that the public
interest is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the kids who write in, that's probably the question
they ask the most _ when are we going to get back to the moon? When
are we going to Mars?'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra says there were four reasons that the early space
program grew and succeeded
</P>
<P>
   ``One, we had a committed young president, which is an oxymoron
today,'' Schirra said. ``We had a blank check, and the Cold War
(which turned the conquest of space into a defense issue), and that
was a big thing people forget. And then we had people of an age
where they could actually produce what they wanted _ engineers,
technicians, scientists, astronauts, and we all blended together
very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen again, that fourth category, but the other
three, the commitment's gone,'' Schirra said. ``Nothing grand will
happen in this space program without a national commitment, and a
national commitment starts at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left NASA in 1970 and worked for years in Walt Disney's
research and development division. He's currently president and
chief executive officer for Galaxy Aerospace Management Inc., a
company engaged in retrofitting old aircraft as well as designing
new ones. He lives in Van Nuys, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra left the space agency in 1969, has had a lucrative
business career, and still enjoys public speaking. He lives in this
small community just north of San Diego, where many of his old Navy
buddies also retired.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter has had perhaps the most adventurous post-NASA life,
holding the title of both astronaut and aquanaut. He joined the
Navy's Sealab program after leaving the space program in 1967 and
lived in the experimental station on the ocean floor for 30 days.
He works as a consultant on ocean and space technology programs,
and has developed still another career as a fiction writer.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, each of the Mercury astronauts were assigned
duties in connection with their comrades' flights, usually working
in tracking stations at far-flung areas of a world where
communications satellites were a novel concept.
</P>
<P>
   This week, when Glenn blasts off, what's left of the old
astronaut corps will be at Cape Canaveral, Fla., but in a different
capacity. Schirra, Cooper and Carpenter will all be doing
television commentary on their old pal's flight.
</P>
<P>
   When Schirra was interviewed by the Chronicle, he said Shepard
had been quite ill but was hoping to be there to see Glenn's
launch. Less than 24 hours later, his good friend would be dead.
</P>
<P>
   But in Schirra's den that morning, his stories of the glory days
often began with the first American in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shepard and I lived for teasing.'' Schirra said. ``And Gordo
does, too, but Shepard and I are a little faster. We live for
gotchas.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how the first American in space pulled one of his
favorite ``gotchas'' on the first American in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our favorite stories Shepard and I tell, Al got a new
Olds convertible when they lived in Houston,'' Schirra said,
leaning forward conspiratorially. ``This was after Mercury _ we'd
been transferred to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming down to our house for some kind of meeting and
Al and Louise (Shepard) were in their convertible, driving down
this big highway, the Gulf Freeway. And Al was apparently going a
little bit faster than the speed limit, and got pulled over,''
Schirra continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman asked for his driver's license. Al didn't have it.
He asked for registration _ new car, he didn't have it. And the
policeman said, ``Oh, I recognize you Col. Glenn _ go ahead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schirra was pounding the table and laughing at this point in the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I laughed so hard about that and poor old John was just
furious,'' &UR;  &LR; when he found out he'd been blamed for Shepard's hot
rodding. &QL;

SUNDAY, OCT. 25 
 
 
By LEON HALE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1962, when John Glenn flew around the world three times in
that Friendship 7 capsule, I was conducting a search for heroes.
Glenn showed up at exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted better role models for my kids. They were then 11 and
9, and the people they admired didn't seem so admirable to me.
</P>
<P>
   My son was a disciple of Mickey Mantle and some long-haired drag
racer whose name I forget. My daughter was in love with a rock 'n'
roller. Maybe he was Elvis. Along about that time I remember
reading those two words, Elvis Presley, and I thought they made up
the dumbest name ever hung on a little baby. I said then that
nobody answering to a name like that would ever amount to anything.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted my children to have solid citizens for role models.
Mickey Mantle was good about hitting home runs, sure, but his
personal life wasn't so nice. And long-haired drag racers were
disgusting to me. At that time I was much smarter than I am now,
and I was able to judge the character of people by the length of
their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Then here came John Glenn, who climbed into that little capsule
stuck on the top of a rocket and let them shoot him 162 miles high
and he whizzed around the planet for three orbits and came blazing
back into the atmosphere and landed with a glorious splash in the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   I told my kids, Look, here's a genuine hero for you. Forget your
beer-guzzling athletes and your hip-grinding musicians and your
greasy-headed race-car drivers. John Glenn has done something no
American has ever done, and he has risked his hide to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, I said, he has taken us across the threshold of a
new frontier. (I did a good deal of lecturing in those days, before
my children got so big I couldn't make them sit still to listen.)
He has opened up a horizon, and ushered us into the Space Age.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds cornball now, as it did to my children in '62, and
yet I still believe it.
</P>
<P>
   A great thing about Glenn was that he looked like a hero. He had
that college halfback appearance, not pretty but not ugly, either.
And he had short hair.
</P>
<P>
   Also he'd already proven he had the right stuff. A combat pilot
in two wars, with something like 150 missions.
</P>
<P>
   But to me personally, the greatest thing about Glenn was this:
He and I were almost exactly the same age. Born in '21, less than
two months apart.
</P>
<P>
   My campaign to make Glenn a hero to my children was not
successful, but he has remained heroic to me. Not as a politician
but mainly for that historic ride he took in the capsule 36 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about laying your life on the line for your country. I
doubt there's ever been full public understanding of the grave risk
Glenn was exposed to on that mission. Even now, being shot into
space on a rocket amounts to an experimental test flight, so
imagine all the unknowns that went up with Glenn in that Friendship
7 capsule.
</P>
<P>
   I've always admired the way he talked about those risks. When he
was back home safely and doing all the interviews, I remember a
reporter asking him what would have happened if the capsule's heat
shield had failed, on reentry. That was pretty close to what space
exploration reporters call a sick question.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, if the heat shield had failed, Glenn would have been
fried. But he grinned and answered like this: ``It would have been
a bad day at Black Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, that was Roy Rogers talking. It was just the way we want
our heroes to talk about risk and danger. We needed that then, when
we were feeling inadequate to the Russians on space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   If there's politics involved in Glenn's ticket to ride on this
Oct. 29 mission, it doesn't make an ounce of difference to me. His
going up there, when both of us are 77, is like me going along as
well.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Glenn is in better physical condition than I am. I sure
hope so. I figure the launch will be the toughest test for him,
with all those G's pressing on his brave old heart. But once he's
in orbit, why can't a 77-year-old guy float around in a weightless
environment as easy as any pink-cheek rookie?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be a news story if this old guy performed better in
a weightless environment than the young people?
</P>
<P>
   Then finally I've decided not to be embarrassed by this thought,
which I'm unable to resist:
</P>
<P>
   What if John Glenn returned from space younger than when he
left? &QL;

   CALIFORNIA -- CARACE. U.S. Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Pleasanton,
maintains a $200,000 fund-raising advantage over challenger Charles

   CONNECTICUT -- GULF. Advocates for veterans suffering from
so-called Gulf War Syndrome won a major victory this week. One of
the provisions tucked into the massive budget bill, which passed
earlier this week, directs the Department of Veteran Affairs to
assume Gulf War veterans with certain maladies got those
afflictions from exposure to specific chemical agents during the

FESTIVAL TOWN NEW BRAUNFELS, TEXAS, GETS DIFFERENT VIEW OF TOURISTS
VIEWING FLOOD DAMAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ They drive by slowly, windows down,
cameras drawn. They aim at muddy mattresses, uprooted trees, easy
chairs that have strayed from home, crumpled tin and trash.
</P>
<P>
   Click. Flash. Another drive-by photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sick,'' said Kevin Webb of the people gawking at the
flood-drenched homes along Common Street, which leads to this
German community's annual Wurstfest celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional beer bash will begin as planned Oct. 30, but the
nearby stretch of Common along the Comal River is a stunning
testament to this popular town's stricken state: at least 215 homes
destroyed, 323 homes with major damage, 412 with minor damage, 163
apartments damaged or destroyed and 54 mobile homes gone for good.
Damages for residents and area businesses are expected to exceed
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have anything, and people are driving by taking
pictures of it,'' Webb said. ``Their stuff is lying around and
people are going and picking it up. It's tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sightseeing and souvenir hunting had definitely taken a darker
turn this week in this scenic Hill Country town of 32,000 where
tourists usually take in the towering limestone bluffs, the flowing
green waters and the dips and dives at the giant water park called
Schlitterbahn.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of the river outfitters, especially along the
Guadalupe River on Gruene and River roads, were hit by fierce flood
waters that carried away rafts and tubes, crushed tool sheds and
shops, trashed buses, swallowed cars and collapsed the living
quarters of river tour guides.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, general manager at Rockin' R River Rides, supervised the
cleanup of debris and the setting of bonfires Thursday at the
headquarters of what is Comal County's largest river rental
company. The New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce estimates that this
company alone suffered $5 million in flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   Eight yellow school buses with the Rockin' R logo stood covered
in mud and filled with tree limbs, their windshields broken out.
Maybe they're worth a few spare parts, Webb said, if that. To his
right were the remains of his office and what once was a T-shirt
shop, to his left the shell of a restaurant. What's left mostly are
piles of tin and the constant beep of a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road, a large man in a cowboy hat lifts one muddy,
souvenir T-shirt at a time and hoses it off. The damaged shirts are
destined for an orphanage in Mexico, explained Charles Lackey,
general manager of the Gruene River Co.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 215 rafts, he said 100 were left. The business lost at
least $200,000, maybe twice that much, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us had any flood insurance,'' he said. ``The water has
never been this high before so nobody expected it. It just kept
coming. Before we knew it the buildings were under water.''
</P>
<P>
   Carloads of curious onlookers also ventured past road
barricades, through a low-water crossing and onto the main
stretches of River Road, where dangerous cleanup efforts were under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Folks jokingly warned visitors to watch out for snakes,
scorpions and things falling out of trees. Along the river banks,
the trees appeared at a distance to be draped in colored tinsel _
actually plaid shirts, blue and pink plastic, kitchen rugs and
shiny strips of tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river ravaged everything down through here. I think it's
about the worst I've ever seen,'' said Salvation Army Capt. Gary
Elliott from Waco, who was offering free food to the workers.
``These people down here have no insurance and their whole lives
have been washed away.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true enough, said Shawn Aaglan, of the home where he
lived with brother Scott and their mother Gail. The family had run
a river camp and conducted rafting tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river rose 4 feet in 10 minutes and 20 feet in an hour,''
Aaglan said. ``We had time to get our cats out and ourselves _
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The family rented the home, which owner Sharon Mosley said
she'll have to demolish. Aaglan pointed to the room where kitchen
cabinets laid smashed and the roof has fallen in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tree,'' he said, pointing inside. ``It pierced the house
like a toothpick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just stuck with losing our belongings,'' said his
brother, Scott. ``A lot of people were just wiped out entirely, for
good. They just took what they could get and left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aaglans, holed up right now in a donated RV, say they'll
stay and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the primo campground,'' said Gail Aaglan. ``It's our
river and we're going to clean it up. We're going to pick up every
piece of garbage, every piece of glass.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pledge heard often along the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come see us in March or April,'' said Webb at the Rockin' R.
``You'll be surprised.'' &QL;

TEXANS UNHAPPY WITH CLINTON FOR LYING, RELUCTANT TO REMOVE HIM FROM
OFFICE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six weeks after being bombarded with the lurid details of
President Clinton's extramarital affair, Texans continue to march
in step with national public opinion, unhappy that he lied about
it, but reluctant to see him removed from office, a new statewide
poll concludes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Poll, a survey of 1,009 adults conducted
over a two-week period in early October, about one-third of the
Texans polled said Clinton should either resign or be removed from
office, with 7 percent advocating removal. Fourteen percent of
those polled thought the president should be censured and 40
percent believe the matter should be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has decided to conduct impeachment hearings after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval rating has slipped only 1 percentage
point, a statistically insignificant decrease, since he admitted to
having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky and since
the release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Comforted by a healthy economy, 57 percent of those polled say
Clinton is doing a good job as president, but only 40 percent think
he is a good person, a 6 percentage-point decline. His job
performance rating is near its all-time high in Texas, which hasn't
thought much of the president since his election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans have traditionally given Clinton low job performance
marks,'' said Texas Poll director Beverly Barnum. ``His approval
rating has historically hovered between 30 percent and 40 percent
and was never above 41 percent until the winter of 1996. Since that
time, job approval has climbed from 46 percent to 57 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though only 7 percent favor Clinton's removal from office, 54
percent said they consider lying under oath about an affair, as
Starr alleges Clinton has done, to be grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In part this ambivalence may have something to do with the
degree to which the public understands the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't really understand what impeachment
means,'' said Earl Black, a professor of political science at Rice
University. ``They think it means removal from office, that if he
is impeached, he is convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House of Representatives votes to impeach the president,
which it may do since there is strong Republican support, he still
has to be convicted by the Senate, before he would be removed from
office, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Black said, Clinton's job approval rating may be high
in the poll because the people taking the survey overestimated the
number of likely voters in their sample. Of the 1,009 Texans
polled, the survey said 764 of them were likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a poll of people who are politically active,''
Black said. ``My hunch is that a lot of the approval for the way
Clinton is doing his job is coming from people who are not
politically active and this is why the polls are overestimating the
true public support that Clinton has.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom Clinton
conducted an 18-month affair, and Starr, who has been investigating
him for four years, don't fare as well in the poll. Only 10 percent
of those surveyed had a favorable impression of Lewinsky as a
person, with men only slightly more inclined to give her a break
than women.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine percent of Texans think Starr is doing a good or
excellent job investigating the president, while 53 percent think
he is only doing a fair job.
</P>
<P>
   As for the congressional elections scheduled for November, the
poll found that the Lewinsky scandal has had an impact on how
people will vote, with 25 percent of Texans saying the matter had
affected their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the respondents, 46 percent, said they would vote
for Republican candidates in the election and 34 percent said they
would vote for the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted October 5-18, has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points. &QL;

`EMPTY WORDS': SKEPTICS ON BOTH SIDES OF ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN
AGREEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Friday prayers had ended and the Arab market was
filled with hundreds of Palestinian merchants selling clothing and
kitchenware when the news came that negotiators had finally reached
a deal at the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just empty words,'' said Amar Tawhi, a young dry cleaner
and one of three Palestinians sitting on the steps outside the Old
City's Damascus Gate. ``There's no peace here between us and the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Jerusalem, Israelis rushed to buy
last-minute food while an ultra-Orthodox Jew in black hat and coat
blew a horn to warn shoppers that the Mehane Yehuda market would
close for the Sabbath at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still will be a big mess with this agreement,'' said
Haim Rucham, a middle-aged fruit vendor at the market who said he
is opposed to making the deal. ``There will still be bombings and
problems. There won't be peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians
favor the peace deal worked out at the Wye Plantation that calls
for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of West Bank territory in
return for specific Palestinian security measures. Negotiators
expect next week to sign the deal reached verbally on Friday. The
signing was held up by Israeli demands to release convicted spy
Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   But months of mutual recrimination and lack of progress in peace
negotiations have left many regular Israelis and Palestinians
skeptical that any deal their leaders sign will be honored by the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is walking out of this thinking this is going to lead
us to a new atmosphere in the Middle East,'' said Reuven Hazan, a
political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``The sides
simply don't trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators tried to overcome these mutual suspicions by locking
in a meticulous timetable for exact actions to be taken by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Over a twelve-week period, Israel will pull troops out of the
West Bank in three intervals. By the end, an additional 13.1
percent of West Bank territory will come under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will also free 750 alleged political prisoners of the
3,500 it is holding, open an airport in Gaza and begin allowing
safe passage for Palestinians to travel freely between the West
Bank and Gaza. The last two are expected to be a boon to the
Palestinians' flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   In return, at each stage, Palestinians will implement specific
security measures, including confiscating illegal weapons, reducing
the Palestinian police force and jailing wanted militants.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency will oversee these measures.
Arafat will convene his legislative body to abrogate clauses of the
Palestine Covenant that are objectionable to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this will work or not _ whether setting up a
three-month timetable and bringing in the Americans _ whether this
doesn't open us up to a vicious circle of recriminations, that
we'll have to wait and see,'' said Hazan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israel says the Palestinians didn't do something so we're
not going to do the withdrawal, then the spiral goes down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, they have gone into details, they have
brought in the CIA on security issues and maybe this will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders, though, will have to contend with hard-liners who
on Friday were quick to rattle sabers against the accord.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin warned that
CIA involvement in security ``cannot erase Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Aharon Domb, leader of an umbrella settler organization, called
the deal an ``agreement of surrender'' and promised ``the gravest
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two leaders, Netanyahu faces the greater threat to his
political survival.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-settlement National Religious Party, a key coalition
partner, announced on Friday that it will not vote for the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to sell whatever he's signed to the right wing,''
said Leslie Susser, diplomatic correspondent for the Jerusalem
Report, Israel's premier political magazine. ``And even then, there
is a fairly realistic chance that he could face (early)
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most analysts predict that his cabinet will vote for
the deal. And even without the religious party, Netanyahu can
depend on the opposition Labor Party to give him the safety net he
needs to make sure the agreement passes the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   But if and when it does pass, this step will only be one more in
a long process whose outcome in far from sure.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement did not include two issues that are almost
sure to become sticking points in the future: Another troop
withdrawal from the West Bank and a time-out on ``unilateral
actions'' diplomatic language for Israeli expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   And once the two sides pass these hurdles, they move on to even
harder issues that were shelved during interim deals and will only
be tackled when the two sides begin tough negotiations on a final
peace treaty: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders and
Palestinian demands for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   What Friday's deal may do is stave off Palestinian threats to
declare independence next May, when interim agreements expire,
which would likely spawn violence. That date now has a greater
chance of passing peacefully while the two sides, on a smoother
path, work toward a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Israelis and Palestinians will have to hope
that this deal can pull them out of a stalemate that has dragged on
too long and soured hopes on both sides that agreements signed five
years ago can lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree to everything, to arrest Hamas, to do everything for
the thirteen percent,'' said Ashraf Sumayra, a 23-year-old
Palestinian talking on a cellular phone inside the gates of the Old
City. ``We need this peace.''

ARCHITECT OF DISABILITIES ACT LIVES MOST ORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY
LIFE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Lex Frieden, a chief architect of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, is adamant about the ordinariness of his life. He
eats microwave dinners. He procrastinates on his taxes and worries
about saving for retirement. He's been married for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get up every morning, take our grandson to school,'' he
said. ``We have to figure out how to pay our bills. We're like an
ordinary, middle-aged family.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``ordinary'' in the Frieden household is, by most standards,
nothing short of extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Houstonian has been paralyzed since his neck was
broken in a car accident 31 years ago. His wife, Joyce, is
paraplegic because of a rare disease that struck her brain and
spinal cord when she was a young mother. They share their home _
and homemaking chores _ with a longtime friend, Mac Brodie, who has
no short-term memory because of a brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they live a life that includes working, socializing,
traveling and raising a rambunctious, karate-chopping 7-year-old
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Each fills in according to his or her abilities. Joyce can
drive. Mac helps Frieden with physical tasks, like taking a shower,
or getting in and out of bed. Frieden helps Mac remember where he
is and what he's supposed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, this unlikely trio travels to Washington so Frieden
can collect a $50,000 award for his work as an advocate for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unusual family,'' said Justin Dart, a Texan who
served five presidential appointments and helped write the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac is one of the most unique people I've met,'' he explained.
He calls Joyce a ``tremendous advocate'' and hails Frieden as ``one
of the great patriots of 20th century America.'' The ADA, he said,
``would not have passed without Lex Frieden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a pioneer of independent living, he's a pioneer of
rehabilitation,'' said Dart. ``He's a real Renaissance man.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieden zips through the halls of TIRR, The Institute for
Rehabilitation and Research, in his electric wheelchair (top speed:
6 mph), recounting patients' success stories. A former patient
himself, he is now senior vice president of the facility located in
the Texas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence is kind of a relative thing,'' he said. He used
to think it meant the ability to do things alone; now, he finds, it
means ``you can get there. Everyone has help in one form or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing behind Frieden is housemate and constant companion Mac,
a 51-year-old Vietnam vet who earned two Purple Hearts but returned
from the war with a permanent mental disability. He can read,
multiply and count, but he can't remember people unless he's met
them several times.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when he woke up in Washington, Mac asked Frieden what they
were doing in Pasadena, because he could see the San Jacinto
Monument outside their hotel window. Frieden reminded Mac he was
looking at the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them take Metro Lift, the wheelchair-accessible city
buses, to work every morning. Frieden helps Mac organize his day,
making sure Mac has a note or list in his pocket. On a recent
morning, Mac took one of his hobbies, a weaving project, to the
TIRR cafeteria while Frieden made travel arrangements to
Switzerland. Frieden called Mac on his cellular phone, and told him
to make a note to himself that Joyce would be picking them up for
lunch at 12:30.
</P>
<P>
   A little before 12:30, Mac was back in the office, ready to go.
Joyce, who drives a maroon van equipped with a hydraulic lift,
whisked them off to an Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   When Frieden's neck was broken, he was a student at Oklahoma
State University and had been valedictorian of his high school
class. His bright future suddenly was uncertain. He found himself
the recipient of unwanted pity. When he tried to transfer to Oral
Roberts University, he was denied admission because he used a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a series of mind-boggling episodes,'' remembered
Frieden. ``I don't think anyone is prepared to deal with the whole
series of changes that occur so rapidly in your life as they did in
mine at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The summer after his accident, Frieden was at the HemisFair in
San Antonio with a group of high school friends and his choir
director. With his wheelchair parked on the sidewalk, he sipped a
soft drink and discussed which exhibit they should visit next.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger walked by _ and dropped 50 cents into his cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just 18 years old and trying to cope with the results of
the accident I'd had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes you stop and think about what society expects of
you. Worst part of it was, it spoiled my Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Frieden is considered a founder and leader of the
independent living movement. As executive director of the National
Council on Disability from 1984-1988, he and his staff wrote a
proposal that laid the foundation for the Americans with
Disabilities Act. The ADA, signed into law in 1990, was the world's
first comprehensive civil rights law for the disabled, protecting
them from discrimination in employment, public accommodations,
transportation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Frieden, it was an emancipation proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Frieden eats with the help of an orthosis, a metal
brace that enables him to hold a pen or a fork. Joyce slices the
meat on his plate, and lifts his iced tea glass to his lips, as
automatically as if she were doing it for herself. Mac sits
quietly, a contented smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we try to live a typical life, we're not typical
people. We're pretty pushy,'' said Joyce. ``We've been places
nobody thought we could go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lex Frieden's unique arrangement with Mac began in 1972 when
Frieden lived in an annex of TIRR as part of an experimental
housing project. Mac, who was living in a home for mentally
retarded people, volunteered to help the residents at Frieden's
place. Unaware of Mac's disability, Frieden and his friends sent
Mac to the convenience store for a six-pack of beer. Unable to
remember his errand, Mac simply walked home, the $5 in his pocket
unspent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Frieden and Mac became friends. Mac's mother suggested
that the two of them might be able to live on their own if they
combined forces. So they rented a house together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good match. One I later called a symbiosis,''
Frieden said. He called it ``fortuitous'' that they both enjoy
friends, travel, the computer and music _ ``although Mac is pretty
well stuck on the Beach Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Frieden met Joyce Nelson. They had seen each other
around the University of Houston campus, where he was taking
graduate classes and she was an undergrad, but didn't speak until
they saw each other at a meeting to organize a coalition of
disabled people. Joyce, who had lost the use of her legs three
years earlier, said she had planned to find a partner who was not
disabled, someone who could help solve practical problems, like
getting over curbs.
</P>
<P>
   But along came Frieden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been attracted by brains,'' she said. ``I figured
between the two of us, we could figure out a way around any
problems that might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Frieden and Joyce eloped, and had their ceremony
performed in front of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.
Wedding photos were shot by a passing tourist.
</P>
<P>
   When Joyce moved in, the three of them adjusted easily to the
arrangement. Having been in college, ``the dorm concept wasn't
really that foreign,'' Joyce said. Mac had no problem with it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac, in general _ it may be a part of his disability _
wherever he is, he has no point of reference. So it doesn't seem to
be a surprise or a worry, ever,'' Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac doesn't have many bad memories, and he has some good
memories,'' Frieden added.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them live in a southwest Houston house that, except
for a few mini-ramps over doorsills, hasn't been remodeled for
wheelchair users. Modifications are expensive. They chose the house
because its oversized rooms make it easier for two wheelchairs to
pass. They don't have a cook, daily housekeeper or other aides
other than ``Governor,'' a 165-pound Great Dane.
</P>
<P>
   Receipts, letters, scrapbooks and other items cover countertops
and tables. When you can't reach cabinets, it's harder to put
things away, Joyce explains. To wash dishes, Joyce reaches up and
over into a standard-height sink. (For the sake of convenience,
they usually eat out.) To bathe, Joyce transfers herself from her
wheelchair to a shower chair in the bathtub. Mac helps Frieden do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Mac has his own room down the hall from the Friedens' bedroom. A
family portrait, taken in 1984, hangs on the wall: Lex, Joyce and
Mac. The periphery of the room is piled with his art supplies and
skeins of yarn and a small loom. Frieden surveyed the mess and
said, ``I don't know Mac. I don't think you'd pass a Naval
inspection today.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, they added another member to the family: Trey,
now 7, the son of Joyce's daughter from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been taking care of nieces and nephews,'' Joyce said.
``It just didn't seem foreign to us. We had been taking care of
Trey as grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   But she admits she had to find ways to help him burn off energy,
signing him up for soccer, karate, scouts and gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   On Mondays, Joyce takes Trey to tae kwan do lessons. Wednesdays,
she reads to kindergarteners at his school. Between stories, she
answers questions that range from ``Will you walk again?'' to ``Can
you really feel it if I hit your toe?''
</P>
<P>
   She said she volunteers at the school because she wants kids to
see that it's OK to use a wheelchair. That way, if they ever wind
up in one, they'll have an easier time adjusting than she did.
She's also making herself a familiar presence at Trey's school ``so
they can ask me questions rather than bother him with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Past recipients of the Henry B. Betts Award for disability
advocates have invited 100 to 600 guests to their receptions. When
organizers asked Frieden how many invitations he would need, they
were a little stunned when he said to put him down for 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he's racked his brain to make sure he's not
leaving anyone out. He's inviting former President Bush, who
nominated him for the honor and listened to his initial proposal
for the ADA. There's a guy he used to go fishing with. He's
inviting his 73-year-old choir director from Alva, Okla., who took
Frieden and a station wagon-load of boys to Acapulco after Frieden
broke his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, in short, who enabled him to lead an extraordinarily
ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Frieden is going to do with his $50,000 cash prize,
he says it'll be nothing unusual. Something for the house, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Probably a wheelchair-accessible shower. &QL;

GALVESTON RESIDENTS QUESTION PLANS TO STUDY NEW AND DEADLY DISEASES
IN THIS TEXAS TOURIST TOWN 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Some Galveston residents question the wisdom
of plans by the University of Texas Medical Branch to study newly
discovered, deadly viruses in this barrier-island tourist town so
vulnerable to hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   But university officials are assuring skeptics that the kinds of
viruses that would be studied in the proposed Biosafety Level 4
(BSL4) laboratory pose virtually no threat to the surrounding
community even if the top-security lab were to get blown up _ or
down.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an unprecedented effort to build community support
for a project, the scientists who would use the laboratory are
holding public forums and making personal appearances before civic
groups. They explain how the high-security lab, similar in
appearance to those depicted in Hollywood movies _ would work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scientists even hit the streets before sunrise one
day last week to take their message to the University Area
Association, the neighborhood group that speaks for many of UTMB's
closest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   There they encountered retired oil company employee Barbara
Murdoch, who said she supports the medical school's efforts to
study new viruses and bacteria and understands the need to
anticipate deadly public-health threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is location,'' Murdoch told the scientists, echoing
fears expressed by some during other forums. ``Not what, not why,
but where.''
</P>
<P>
   While they say they understand such public concerns, officials
at the medical school say that if a hurricane bears down on
Galveston, scientists would simply render the laboratory
noninfectious. The process, which would include sterilizing and
then incinerating the carcasses of infected research rats and
rabbits, would take barely an hour, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory would be located in a double-shelled, limited
access, concrete building stronger than any other structure in
Galveston, officials say. It would be so strong that facilities
director Mike Shriner says he is ``confident this building would
survive a tornado-type storm'' that offers no time for
sterilization of the entire laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Air and liquid wastes from the lab would be sterilized and solid
wastes would be incinerated, officials said. Most materials shipped
in and out of the facility would be noninfectious. Those that
aren't would be shipped according to long-established federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   While he supports all the safety plans for the proposed
laboratory, Dr. Charles F. ``Chuck'' Fulhorst tells Galvestonians
the precautions go well beyond those actually necessary for the
viruses that would be studied there.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes that the viruses are not airborne and, since
rodents and not people are the natural hosts for the bugs, it's
virtually impossible for diseases they cause to be transmitted from
person to person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facility is overbuilt,'' said Fulhorst, who handled the
deadly Ebola virus during four years of work at the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``The risk is really
to the investigator and not to the community. But we continue to
overbuild these containment facilities to err on the conservative
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulhorst and others note that the Atlanta center's Level 4 lab
is in a residential area and within 100 yards of a day-care center.
Prospective neighbors to the proposed Galveston lab should have
even fewer concerns than Atlanta residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you blow up the building and the thermal destruction alone
doesn't kill the virus, it can't go anywhere,'' said Fulhorst.
``There's nothing in that lab that can amplify and increase itself.
If the lab is blown up, that's the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rats carrying a hantavirus similar to that which killed people
in a 1993 outbreak in the southwestern United States are present
around Galveston and across Texas, Fulhorst said. If infected rats
escaped the proposed UTMB lab, they would pose little, if any,
threat to neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some Galvestonians have suggested the lab's establishment
might frighten away tourists, Fulhorst said people who attended the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta wanted to tour the Centers for Disease
Control.
</P>
<P>
   Movies and other media reports exaggerate the communicability of
even the most feared viruses, Fulhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ebola virus has caused fatal epidemics in Africa in recent
years. Studies show, however, that when people who care for Ebola
victims take such basic precautions as wearing face masks, the
disease is not readily spread person-to-person, Fulhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   The UTMB administration next month will ask the University of
Texas Board of Regents to approve the laboratory's construction.
The estimated $5 million to $7.5 million to build the high-tech
laboratory would come from Galveston's Sealy and Smith Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, construction could begin in July. The target
completion date is sometime in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to build such a laboratory at the University of Texas
Medical Branch evolved from the decision to locate the World Health
Organization's Center for Tropical Diseases on the campus in 1994.
Since then, the medical school has recruited an internationally
known team of tropical-disease research experts, two of whom
brought with them from Yale University one of the world's most
extensive collections of virus cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have on hand people who have the expertise and have
legitimate reasons for needing such a facility to be able to carry
on such research,'' Dr. Adrian S. Perachio told residents last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Perachio, UTMB associate vice president for basic research, said
the proposed Galveston facility would specialize in research on
viruses found in the southern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean
basin and Central and South America, as well as searching for
yet-undiscovered viruses in those regions. None of the work there
would duplicate research in the handful of other BSL4 labs in the
United States and Canada, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These viruses are endemic to this area,'' Perachio said.
``They are a threat to our population and, even though cases have
emerged and been documented as having been caused by these viruses,
there really has been no progress made in the treatment and
prevention of these diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Research in the proposed lab should lead to early diagnoses and
development of therapeutic drugs or vaccines, Fulhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost and efficiency concerns raised in a feasibility study
already have ruled out an off-campus location for the proposed lab,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory needs to be on the Galveston campus because,
although only a few scientists will actually use it, the work they
do would dovetail with research by other scientists in many other
laboratories on the campus, Perachio said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who attended discussions of the proposal expressed
concern that UTMB scientists will decide later that they want to
study viruses or bacteria that present greater threats to the
university's neighbors and would require use of monkeys or other
larger animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have specifically designed the facility only to use small
rodents and rabbits or smaller species,'' Perachio said, however.
``The facility is not designed nor can it be remodeled for use of
species like nonhuman primates (monkeys).''
</P>
<P>
   Fulhorst said he and other scientists also would not use tiny
test subjects such as ticks and mosquitoes that might somehow
escape the laboratory unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   While Murdoch said a lengthy explanation of plans for the lab
helped allay some of her concern, she still would like to hear
opinions on the medical and physical safety of the lab from more
objective sources such as the Federal Emergency Management
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Fulhorst said that a team of inspectors from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, as well as from other sectors of
the public health system, would inspect the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Some others who attended recent meetings about the proposed
laboratory came away satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here with my mind set against it,'' one woman, who
refused to give her name, told UTMB officials after a public forum
in early October. ``Now, I hope you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident that they are doing nothing that would
harm us as residents, but things that would help us as human
beings,'' said Suzanne Bishop, 58, a University Area Association
member who heard Murdoch express her concerns. ``I think it's
important for the public to be aware, but I truthfully did not have
any major concerns.'' &QL;

PALESTINIAN BROTHERS SHARE NAME, TIME IN JAIL, BUT PATHS SPLIT OVER
POLITICS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURA, West Bank _ From the beginning, Sheikh Naif Rajoub, a
slightly built Islamic preacher and a leader of the militant Hamas
organization, has been a vocal opponent of peace agreements the
Palestinian Authority signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``imam,'' or prayer leader, of Dura's main mosque, Rajoub
often uses the pulpit to blast the accords and the cooperation they
created between Israeli and Palestinian security forces or to
preach the sanctity of Palestinian resistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right to fight the occupation,'' Rajoub said from
his home in Dura, a Palestinian-ruled village of 10,000 just south
of Hebron on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not give up this right,'' Rajoub maintained. ``But our
security forces cooperate to arrest Palestinians and are on the
Israeli side.''
</P>
<P>
   It may come as a surprise that Rajoub's older brother, Col.
Jibril Rajoub, heads the Palestinian Preventive Security, the
Palestinian Authority's secretive police agency charged with
arresting militants opposed to making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Gruff and abrasive, with a raspy Mafia whisper, this Rajoub is
ensconced in Jericho, where he commands thousands of plainclothes
agents and has ordered the arrest of hundreds of Hamas militants
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Rajoubs' situation is far from unique. Across the West
Bank and Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinian families are
similarly split by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like this in every house,'' said the younger Rajoub, 38,
sitting below a picture of himself, zipped up in a thick winter
jacket, that was taken while he and 400 other Hamas activists were
deported temporarily to Lebanon by Israel in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wye Plantation Mideast peace talks last week, Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat apparently agreed to a CIA-created security
blueprint detailing measures he will use to reign in his militant
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Rajoub brothers illustrate the difficulty the Palestinian
leader faces in his quest to put any such blueprint into action; to
do so literally means pitting brother against brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family has brothers who support Hamas and some who
support the Authority,'' said Naif Rajoub.
</P>
<P>
   When they were teen-agers on a farm in Dura, both Rajoubs spent
time in Israeli jails for resisting Israel's military occupation of
the West Bank. But early on, the two brothers began to take
separate paths.
</P>
<P>
   Jibril Rajoub, jailed for the first time at 15, spent 17 years
in Israeli prisons, where he became a prison leader in Arafat's
mainstream Fatah organization. Released in 1985, he was deported to
Tunisia four years later and joined the Palestine Liberation Army,
the military branch of the secular Palestinian government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oslo peace accords were signed with Israel in 1993,
Col. Rajoub was hand-picked by Arafat to head the PSS, one of six
police organizations established under the terms of the peace deal.
A year later, he set up headquarters in Jericho, a dusty desert
oasis 30 miles east of Jerusalem on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Naif Rajoub, only 8 years old the first time Jibril
was arrested, knew early on that he would lead a religious life. By
age 22, he was the ``imam,'' or preacher, of Dura's main mosque.
Eventually he became a follower of Hamas, the Islamic organization
violently opposed to peace agreements with Israel. A third brother
is a building contractor who shuns politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in Islam,'' Naif Rajoub explains. ``My brother is
convinced of secular ways. So I went this way and he went that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jibril Rajoub defends the peace agreements signed with
Israel as the only path that can lead to a Palestinian homeland.
``It is a kind of struggle that will lead to the goal of
independence,'' the colonel said through a spokesman, Col. Samih
Kanaan of the PPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any military action is against the Palestinian national
interest, so we will prevent it,'' Col. Kanaan said. ``We have to
achieve our goals by peaceful means.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the elder Rajoub has protected those beliefs by
overseeing the arrest of hundreds of Hamas activists, who are
jailed whenever there appears to be a chance for progress in
negotiations with Israel and released whenever the political
dialogue between Arafat and the militant organization is going
well.
</P>
<P>
   Jibril Rajoub even ordered the arrest of his militant brother
for a day. In 1997, Naif Rajoub recalled, agents of the PSS knocked
on his door at night. ``They told me, `Israel wants to attack this
area, so it's better for you to come with us,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat himself had ordered Naif Rajoub's arrest after hearing
that someone named Rajoub had been spotted with a known Hamas bomb
maker. The wanted man turned out to be a distant cousin of Jabril
and Naif.
</P>
<P>
   The incident didn't sour the brothers' relations, which the
younger Rajoub characterizes as ``in the middle.'' But Naif Rajoub,
like other Hamas leaders, thinks Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation is too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, four Hamas bomb makers have been assassinated
under mysterious circumstances that prompted Hamas spiritual leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to allege that security cooperation had ``led
to the killing of some of our fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the weeks leading up to the summit at the Wye Plantation,
the Palestinian Authority arrested dozens of Hamas leaders,
including about 30 from the Hebron area. Rajoub sees those arrests
as a cynical move by Arafat to try to win concessions at the
negotiating table. ``They are the sacrificial lambs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is starting to be worried about what the Palestinian
Authority is doing against their own people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In word and in deed, the preacher has nothing but contempt for
the Palestinian Authority. Once, when he was driving in a car with
an Israeli license plate, a Palestinian policeman on duty in the
southern West Bank village pulled him over and told him it was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub answered: ``You Palestinian police are the slaves of the
people who own these cars!''
</P>
<P>
   And Rajoub scoffs at the idea that peace agreements with Israel
will solve the Palestinians' political problems or create an
independent homeland out of the disjointed chunks of territory that
have so far come under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is this state?'' Naif Rajoub asks. ``Most of the land is
still under Israeli control. The Israelis are still confiscating
land, demolishing houses and building settlements. What did we get
from this agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   If any Wye Plantation deal is implemented, the Palestinian
Authority will be able to answer that question with tangible
territorial gains. And if the aftermath of past agreements is any
gauge, that means support for Hamas, hovering now at about 20
percent, will go down.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Palestinian Authority is in the uncomfortable
position of enforcing an unpopular peace agreement. And they are
caught in a Catch 22: It's easier for Palestinian police to locate
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are related to them; they know who they are,'' Naif
Rajoub explained.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the same reasons that make it difficult for the
Palestinian Authority to arrest Hamas militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother gives me many reasons why Hamas should be
arrested,'' said Naif Rajoub. ``He says that if the Palestinians'
security doesn't arrest them, Israel will. He says that it's
necessary because Hamas wants to stop the peace process. He says we
want to kill the Palestinian dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe him,'' the younger Rajoub continued. ``I
tell him that arresting Hamas is like massacring the Palestinian
people. I tell him, `I'm your brother, I'm from your people. How
can you arrest me?' ''

CRITICS SEE GLENN'S FLIGHT AS AGE-OLD PUBLIC RELATIONS STUNT 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As NASA finishes preparations for the most closely watched
mission since the Challenger disaster, a lively debate continues
about why a 77-year-old man is being sent back into space.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Glenn says the journey, coming 36 years after he
became the first American to orbit the Earth, is all about
scientific research to aid the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But others, both within the space agency and those who closely
follow its workings, see other motives.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics believe the mission is little more than the
proverbial ``gold watch'' for a retiring lawmaker and American
hero, or dismiss it as a public relations ploy in a time of
shrinking budgets.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's some of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs heroes,'' NASA administrator Dan Goldin said
earlier this month at a Rice University lecture. ``When I said to
Sen. Glenn, `You're going to space to do research but also as an
American hero who deserves a second flight.' He bristled at me a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he's going to space to do science,'' added Goldin,
who approved Glenn's flight last January. ``He's also going to
space to say America is a land of explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said, ``If you eliminate the science benefits, there is no
reason (for me to go) except that I want to go again. But that is
not a justification for sending someone. Lots of people would like
to go. We are going for science.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will become the oldest human to travel in space if the
shuttle Discovery and its crew of six others blasts off as
scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 300,000 tourists are expected to line the roadways
and beaches to watch the launch, and the 2,500 media credential
requests approach the number sought for the first moon landing in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   As one rationale for his flight, Glenn proposed that he serve as
a research subject in experiments that will look for a link between
the natural aging process and the effects of spaceflight on the
body's muscle, skeletal, immune and cardiovascular systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a stunt,'' claims Alex Roland, who chairs the Duke
University History Department and once chronicled space development
for NASA. ``There is no substance to it whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain level it's sort of charming _ if you take this at
its most innocent level. He's a magnificent physical specimen. He's
kept up with his training, so it is at a very low cost to the
taxpayer,'' said Roland. ``Isn't it marvelous this old codger would
even want to do this, and secondly that he is physically capable of
doing it, and hooray for old people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that level it does have a lot of public interest. But you
do have to ask yourself if there is more going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   By NASA's own design, Discovery's nine-day flight is a
hodge-podge of almost everything its shuttle can do in space:
deploy and retrieve satellites and serve as a laboratory for a
phenomenally range of experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will serve as a subject in two major medical experiments.
One will require at least a dozen blood draws and regular urine
sample collections to reveal the way his body metabolizes the
proteins that form his musculature.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts lose significant amounts of muscle and bone mass
while they are weightless, a major impediment to a lengthy voyage
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly experience similar gradual declines on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts reverse the muscle and bone mass loss after they
return to Earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's second major experiment will study his sleep patterns.
Young astronauts, like many elderly, have difficulty sleeping. The
loss of sleep degrades their waking performance.
</P>
<P>
   The sleep experiment will require Glenn to don a sleep cap with
electrodes to monitor his heart rate, respiration and movement.
Every two to three days, Glenn will also be required to swallow a
large, cold-pill sized electronic device, equipped with a
thermometer and a tiny radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The pill will monitor Glenn's core body temperature and transmit
the results to a portable receiver recorder strapped to his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASA disclosed Glenn had been quietly dropped from
another facet of the experiment that would have required him to
take either a pill containing a small amount of the hormone
melatonin or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a gland in the brain, melatonin is considered a
natural sleep remedy, one that could help weary astronauts and
possibly the elderly obtain the rest they need. Neither Glenn nor
NASA would disclose why he was removed from that experiment.
</P>
<P>
   He will, however, continue to participate in post-sleep surveys
of his performance, which will be conducted with a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will also join his crewmates in eight other experiments
that have been conducted on previous shuttle astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Those will monitor cardiovascular activity, changes in his
body's ability to ward off illness and adjustments in the way his
nervous system maintains balance, both in space and immediately
upon his return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Williams, the physician-astronaut who directs NASA's
life science research, said Glenn's availability for spaceflight
offered experimenters an unusual but worthwhile opportunity. There
are no plans to fly other elderly astronauts for at least several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Glenn is serving as sort of a medical lighthouse,
someone whose experiences will serve to point the way for future
research inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing statistically controlled trials,'' Williams
said. ``We are doing experiments that will allow us to make
important observations and to understand very important
physiological processes that can go on to be tested in other
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the statistical significance of a lone contribution
to medical research on the elderly in space is one Glenn addresses
grudging, and his impressive professional resume indicates why.
</P>
<P>
   ``My flight back in 1962 was one flight,'' he notes. ``Was this
statistically significant or not? Should we have gone ahead?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one flight and didn't prove anything, just that we
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn circled the Earth three times on Feb. 20, 1962, U.S.
medical experts debated whether his vision would be so distorted by
the absence of gravity that he could not see his control panel,
whether he would choke on his saliva and whether he would be able
to hold down food.
</P>
<P>
   Without the assurances Glenn provided that those would not be
problems, it would have been impossible to send U.S. explorers to
the moon. &QL;

   Hurricane hunter aircraft investigating Tropical Storm Mitch in
the Caribbean Sea on Friday afternoon found only weak bands of
thunderstorms swirling around the storm's center. Earlier in the
day, a burst of high altitude winds from the west had ripped heavy
thunderstorms away from Tropical Storm Mitch, initiating a
weakening trend. As these winds relax Saturday, the system may once
again begin to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   A strong cold front, a harbinger of the approaching winter
season, will cross the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. As moist
winds from the Pacific Ocean strengthen, areas of showers will
develop from the central California to Washington. Cool air will
advance steadily to the south and east, with showers reaching the
northern and central Rockies on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a jet stream disturbance will trigger patchy showers
from New Mexico to the southwestern Plains states.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling high pressure system with barometer readings near
30.5 inches of mercury will control most of the eastern two-thirds
of the nation. Sinking air currents will sponsor ample sun from
east Texas and the middle Mississippi Valley to the East Coast.
Although frost will cover the ground in parts of the Appalachians
and Tennessee Valley on Saturday morning, the afternoon will turn
much milder. Saturday night will not be as cold, with any frost
limited to sheltered locations in the higher elevation of the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, winds from the east of the southern flank of the high
will produce patchy clouds and showers across the Florida
peninsula, with rip currents affecting beaches along the East
Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Late Storm  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season is less than 40
days away, yet the Tropics have surged back to life late this week.
Tropical storm Mitch was born from a disturbance that had hugged
the Caribbean coast of Columbia. The storm was weak as it drifted
toward Jamaica on Friday. A large area of showers in the Bay of
Campeche showed signs of development Friday and a pair of
disturbances in the eastern Atlantic made progress toward the
northwest. The retreat of the westerlies from the United States
over the next few days may help sustain the life of the late season
storms. &QL;

REGULATING MANAGED CARE, ONCE A DREAM IN CONGRESS, WAS A FLOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 25(   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The conventional Washington wisdom three months ago
was that the 105th Congress gon down in history for regulating
health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans jockeyed in Congress to become known
as the heroes who put an end to the horror stories of death or
injury caused by health plans that actually denied care in some
instances.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a poll showed that nearly 80 percent of respondents
favored federal regulation of managed care. Republican pollster
Frank Luntz said it was the most critical issue in the country to
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But then poof! Congress went home without passing managed health
care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups and the managed care industry claim they killed
it with a multi-million TV advertising campaign with the message
that federal regulation of managed care would jack up the cost of
health care and jeopardize its availability. A slogan: ``When
politicians play doctor, real people can get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, vice president of the American Association of
Health plans, which represents more than 1,000 managed care
companies, said that people began to realize ``that health care is
a very complicated issue and that smashing it with a political
sledge hammer wasn't the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said voters were impressed with the message that
regulation would ``dramatically increase health care premiums for
working families and increase the role of government and
politicians in the health care system.. When the voters finally got
a chance to focus on it, they said it was too risky and too
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Waxman, director of government affairs for Families
USA, an advocacy group that lobbied for more regulation of managed
care, said the issue died because ``although the public really
wanted this legislation, the Republican leadership didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., created task forces headed by Rep. Dennis J.
Hastert, R-Ill., and Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., to draft
legislation and they ``kept stalling and stalling,'' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Republican and Democratic legislative proposals in
both chambers provided for easier emergency room care and
eliminated ``gag clauses'' that prevented physicians from telling
patients about medical options that their health plans might not
cover.
</P>
<P>
   But there were wide differences. The Democratic bill would have
changed federal law to permit patient lawsuits in state court when
health plan coverage denials caused injury or death. Republicans
sided with the health plans, arguing such liability would drive up
the cost of care and lead companies to drop insurance for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although House Republicans passed a managed care bill in July,
Waxman said it was ``a weak sham bill'' that included so-called
poison pills, controversial provisions designed to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also blocked efforts this fall to bring the legislation up
for debate in the Senate, saying there wasn't enough time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster based in Alexandria, Va.,
said the White House sex scandal also contributed to the demise of
efforts to regulate managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton scandal focus kind of demolished the ability to
have people focus on broader legislative issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McInturff added that while ``people are upset in the abstract,''
about horror stories about people denied crucial care by HMOs,
recent polls show 70 to 75 percent rate their own managed care
plans well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dissatisfied are a pretty small chunk of the electorate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP health care lobbyist who did not want to be named said the
sex scandal was ``only the beginning of the air coming out of the
balloon'' on managed care.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, Democrats didn't really want legislation
because that would enable Republicans to claim credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   Once Republicans wrote their own managed care bills, ``Democrats
didn't really know what to do with that,'' he said. ``The issue had
become muddy politically. The Democrats had counted on a clear line
between the parties on this. The Democrats needed for Republicans
to be `bad guys' and once they weren't `bad guys,' they didn't know
what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anybody from either party really wanted it to
pass anyway,'' he said. ``The Republicans were very concerned about
doing damage to the market. The Democrats never wanted to pass
anything because then the country would see the Republican party as
reasonable and trustworthy on health care.''
</P>
<P>
   After the issue failed in Congress, President Clinton announced
it would be his top legislative priority for 1999.

 (af)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Are you on the list?''
</P>
<P>
   The inquisitor, looking formidable with clipboard and pen, was
standing sentinel outside Joe's Pub, the new cabaret and lounge
flanking the lobby of the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The couple in question, looking a tad J. Crew, had no names to
drop and no hope, it seemed, of joining the writers, musicians and
assorted club-enhancing faces who were reveling in the latest
creation of Serge Becker, the club and restaurant designer who has
given New York some of its most successful nightspots of recent
years, including M.K., Bowery Bar, Fez and _ for those old enough
to remember _ Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a private party,'' the doorwoman said, as James Truman of
Conde Nast breezed in with a few friends. The spurned couple, a
copywriter and social worker in their 40s from the Upper West Side,
were about to turn away when something unusual happened. The
doorkeeper swung open the portal.
</P>
<P>
   Was the week-old club desperate for warm bodies last Tuesday
night? Hardly. A birthday party for Ariel Kaminer, a New York
magazine editor, and a sizzling salsa band, Mo-Guajero, had nearly
filled the place to its 160-person capacity. Perhaps the ghost of
Joseph Papp, the man who brought free theater to the masses, had
something to do with the doorwoman's magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of the legendary producer watches over the plush
banquettes, red votives and zinc ballustrades, so perhaps Papp's
inclusionary spirit will also guide door policy at what is already
one of the season's most buzz-heavy nightspots.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the time and the scheduled act, Joe's Pub will be a
swank cabaret, a pre-theater watering hole, a place to slam poetry
or a late-night drop-in center for hip, downtown laze-abouts. If
Becker has his way, Joe's Pub will become the kind of place Sandra
Bernhard might stop into after her Broadway show for an impromptu
encore.
</P>
<P>
   But night-life skeptics question whether the cabaret formula and
the egalitarian ethos of the Public Theater will scare off the
taste-making set that has previously flocked to Becker's ventures.
The unusual split personality of Joe's Pub _ half cabaret with
tickets sold through Telecharge; half exclusive nightspot with
guest list _ could be a breakthrough for New York's beleaguered
club scene, which has seen few new openings at a time of year
normally hectic with them. Or it may end up being a well-pedigreed
belly-flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In small loungey spaces, the cool crowd will get bored
easily,'' predicted Steve Lewis, the executive director of Life,
the sprawling dance club on Bleecker Street. ``They get tired of
looking at four walls and each other. Without dancing, it's a tough
world out there.'' He pointed out how quickly Shine, a performance
space on West Broadway, lost its sheen. ``I mean how long can you
sit there and listen to some soliloquy about yams?''
</P>
<P>
   But the Public Theater, not Becker, is setting the basic agenda
for Joe's Pub, and its role as performance space has precedence.
``We see it as a place that will have three or four different lives
over the course of an evening,'' said George C. Wolfe, the Public's
producer, who got the idea for Joe's Pub after walking into what
were dreary administrative offices two years ago and being struck
by the room's lofty ceiling and ornate details. ``I thought, `This
needs to be a public space.' But more importantly, I wanted to
create a place that formalizes the improvisational mixing of
artists and audience that goes on in our lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Pub promises to be more than yet another piano bar for
aging torch singers. The Public's long tradition of encouraging
brash, new talent will make sure of that. Among the acts booked for
8:30 p.m. shows in the next two months are Roy Hargrove, the jazz
trumpeter; Roger Guenveur Smith, the actor and playwright, and
Comedy Rhumba, described by the Public as ``the premier
comedy/variety show catering to English-speaking Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will set Joe's Pub apart from other supper clubs and
cabarets is the hand of Becker, whose 14-year career in clubland
has earned him near-mythical status. Becker, who is the majority
owner of the venture, will oversee food service as well as
late-night entertainment after the publicly advertised shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serge can take a garage with no chairs and a dirt floor, make
11 calls, and the place will be packed with pretty women and
fabulous musicians and actors,'' said Nadine Johnson, a publicity
agent who represents Bowery Bar, which is owned by Becker and Eric
Goode.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that by luring top-quality performances to a
friendly, laid-back setting, Becker may forge a new brand of night
life for a generation that has grown weary of loud dance halls,
indifferent service and overhyped bars that put up a velvet rope,
install a few sofas and proclaim themselves ``lounges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're going to see is an interesting fusion of
cutting-edge culture and a sophisticated social scene,'' predicted
Andre Balazs, an owner of the Mercer Hotel, who worked with Becker
on the now-defunct M.K. ``For people of a certain age, myself
included, this will be the perfect place to end an evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Musto, the Village Voice columnist, who turned out to
hear Audra McDonald last Monday night, said he hoped Joe's Pub
would bring back the cabarets of the 1970's, when they were venues
for emerging talents, ``not the dreary places we have now, where
your waiter is too busy singing to take your order.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ambitious content, Becker's ability to pull in the
pretty and pretentious should help earn Joe's Pub frequent
gossip-column mentions, an essential ingredient for stoking a
club's heat.

 NEW YORK: club's heat.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dozen private parties have already been booked for coming
weeks, including one on Tuesday for Jay Faires, the founder of
Mammoth Records, and one on Nov. 11 given by Jennifer Lopez, the
actress, and Details magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday afternoon, as the final traces of sunlight seeped
through the room's soaring quatrefoil windows, workmen scurried
around Joe's Pub making late adjustments to the lighting and the
custom-made table tops that resemble oversize illuminated bar
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, dressed in a black turtleneck, black New Republic
raincoat and his trademark New Balance sneakers, sat in one of his
magenta banquettes with a cell phone affixed to his ear. He was not
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on hold with the carpet people forever,'' he
groaned, as Ali, his Rhodesian Ridgeback nuzzled the Ultrasuede
upholstery, leaving broad smudge marks with her nose.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the space, Becker took cues from Dadaism, German
cabarets of Weimar Republic, the Vienna Secessionists and the
Bauhaus designs of Oskar Schlemmer. He and his collaborator, Derek
Sanders, have covered the walls with thick panels of ink-injected
cork, thin batons of rosewood, and most strikingly, sheets of
corrugated roofing material that have been sheathed in crushed
velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris, Becker was raised in Zurich by his Swiss mother,
a television producer. His Vietnamese father, he said, left the
family when he was still a boy. ``I grew up surrounded by theater
people, and there was never any doubt that I would end up doing
something theatrical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a man so identified with the whirl of New York social life,
Becker is suprisingly shy, almost sheepish. A competitive chess
player as a child, he is more passionate about music and art than
bathing in the aura of models and movie moguls, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Becker was 21 and fresh out of art school when he left Zurich
and moved to New York in 1982. ``Serge was a little club kid when I
met him, and I took him under my wing,'' said Goode, who was then a
partner in Area, the TriBeCa hot spot recently described by Paper
magazine as ``the ultraglamorous nightclub by which all clubs are
now judged.''
</P>
<P>
   Its hallmark was the ever-changing decor and a diverse, often
freakishly attired clientele. Becker helped shape Area's monthly
makeovers, and after it closed in 1987, he and Goode went on to do
M.K., Bowery Bar and B.C., an ill-fated club in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric and Serge made for great partners and have an almost
innate sense of what will and won't work,'' said Shawn Hausman, the
principal designer at Area, who has worked with the pair on several
other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Pub is Becker's first venture without his longtime
partner, and although both men deny it, others say Becker's
decision to go it alone has put a chill in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, long accustomed to being the publicity-shy partner,
recognizes that he can no longer stay in the shadows. ``I'm not
thrilled with working the media, but it's all me now,'' he said.
``I'll do what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging his creative prowess, some of those close to
Becker worry that he lacks the managerial skills or the attention
span that are critical for Joe's Pub's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   Hausman agreed that Becker is more skilled with pens and a
sketchbook than with an accounting ledger. ``Serge isn't much of a
businessman,'' he said. ``Once he finishes the design work, he
likes to hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   Goode agrees with those who are skeptical about the dual
personality of Joe's Pub, saying that the A-list crowd may feel a
bit challenged by poetry slams and disk jockeys spinning bhangra,
the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Hindi music. ``These kinds of
people want to see and be seen,'' he said. ``They can't deal with
anything too highbrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Becker doesn't seem to worry about that. If anything, his
bigger challenge will be how to maintain the right mix of hipdom,
given the mandate of the Public Theater, which has the final say on
the club's operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't get into picking people out of a line,'' said
Bonnie Metzgar, a producer at the Public who will oversee the
club's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Becker recognizes the contradiction of a nonprofit theater's
sponsoring a nightclub, and he hopes that the mix of experimental
music, poetry and performance will substitute for the velvet rope
and scowling doorkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that the bridge-and-tunnel crowd isn't going to be
lining up to see Craig Harris or Ntozake Shange,'' he said,
referring to the jazz trombonist and the playwright, who appeared
together on Friday and Saturday. ``I think it will be
self-editing.''

JEB BUSH'S BACKGROUND, NOT POLITICAL STANCES, TIPPING SCALES OF
FLORIDA VOTERS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ When Jeb Bush walked into the faculty cafeteria at
Adams Junior High School here last week, Katheryn Volker waved him
over. She just had to tell him why he has her vote for governor of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Republican's positions on education or his
opposition to abortion, casino gambling and offshore oil
exploration. He looks sincere and honest, she said. And he has a
dog, Marvin, a black Labrador featured in one of Bush's campaign
advertisements. Volker has two Labs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sold me right away,'' said Volker, a physical education
teacher who _ like many Floridians weighing whom to support on Nov.
3 _ tips the scales toward something other than the candidates'
positions on issues, questions lurking in their background or their
government experience.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that tendency appears to favor Bush, a 45-year-old
former Texan who is making his second run for Florida governor. His
opponent is Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a 65-year-old Democrat and
third-generation Floridian.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush, a Miami real estate developer, leading MacKay
by 10 to 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   If the lead holds up, Jeb and George W. Bush _ who is expected
easily to win re-election as governor of Texas _ will become the
first brother governors since Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas and
Nelson Rockefeller of New York in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And if George W. Bush seeks the presidency in 2000, having a
brother as governor of the fourth-largest state would prove
valuable in winning the Republican nomination and the office
occupied by their father, President George Bush, from 1989 through
1992.
</P>
<P>
   If Jeb Bush wins, Florida state government will be the first in
the South controlled by Republicans since Reconstruction. The GOP
would hold the governor's office, clear majorities in both the
state House and Senate, and _ barring any unforeseen upsets in
congressional elections _ 15 of the state's 23 seats in the U.S.
House and one of the two U.S. Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats lose the governor's office, then Florida is
lost to them for the next decade,'' said Susan MacManus, a
political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles, who defeated Jeb Bush four years ago, said
it is too early to count MacKay out. ``The race is really beginning
to close now, and it's going to be much like our race in 1994 _
Buddy's going to nip him at the wire,'' the governor predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came within 64,000 votes of toppling Chiles, known as
``Walkin' '' Lawton and one of the most popular politicians in
modern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of his defeat, Bush organized a nonprofit group _
the Foundation for Florida's Future _ solicited funds from business
and political friends, then put many of his campaign workers on the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The organization enabled Bush to keep a high public profile as
he lobbied for changes in elderly care, reform of public education
and a cut in unemployment taxes. The foundation also started a
charter school for disadvantaged minority students in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's refusal to disclose details of the foundation's
contributions drew weeks of criticism from MacKay. He also has
lambasted Bush for ``a lack of judgment'' in several business deals
questioned initially by Florida journalists and the Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   While his father was president, the Journal reported, Bush was
paid $650,000 as a consultant to a pump manufacturing company that
sold water pumps to Nigeria. The deal eventually left the U.S.
government holding the bag when Nigeria failed to repay the U.S.
government loan approved by the Bush administration to pay for the
pumps. Jeb Bush denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida newspapers reported that Bush also served as a director
of Ideon, a Jacksonville credit card services company that went
bankrupt after lavish spending by executives. Bush, who was paid
$50,000 a year to serve on the board, says he did not have an
active hand in running the company.
</P>
<P>
   Also drawing fire from MacKay was Bush's effort to lobby federal
officials on behalf of Miguel Recarey, former head of Florida's
largest health maintenance organization who eventually fled to
Venezuela. Federal officials accused Recarey of Medicare fraud
after finding between $200 million and $300 million in federal
money unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was not involved with Recarey after fraud was
alleged, and his early effort was limited to asking federal
officials to treat the company fairly when it sought Medicare
business.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismisses MacKay's charges as innuendo and distortions of
the facts. During a televised debate Tuesday night, Bush said he
could attack MacKay over a $500,000 profit he made from a stock
deal involving his brother, but it would involve ``making it appear
you did something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe you did,`` Bush said. ``But I didn't do
anything wrong either.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, MacKay said he plans to continue challenging Bush on his
business practices. ``Jeb Bush has no public sector experience,''
MacKay said, ``and his private sector business deals raise more
questions than they answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush earned his degree from the University of Texas and worked
for Texas Commerce Bank in Houston and Venezuela before moving to
Miami in 1979. His only government service came in 1987-88, when he
served 18 months as Florida's commerce secretary under Gov. Bob
Martinez. Bush's lack of government experience does not seem to
bother most Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image Jeb Bush has created for himself over the last year
makes people want to vote for him,`` said Jim Kane, director of
Florida Voter, an independent polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Characterized in 1994 as a rich white guy and right-wing
extremist out of touch with the average Floridian, Bush has recast
himself as a compassionate conservative. He has not altered his
socially conservative views, merely how he presents them. He
steadfastly avoids hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Slade, chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said Bush
has presented ``a less hard edge`` in this campaign. ``Jeb is
simply a softer, gentler candidate than he was four years ago,``
Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter his image from 1994, when he said African Americans
could expect ``probably nothing`` from him as governor, Bush has
actively courted black and Jewish voters, groups traditionally
ignored by most Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes across as very honest, sincere,'' said Volker, the
physical education teacher at Adams. ``I believe you can tell that
in a person when you look at them, when you hear them speak.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of assessment leaves MacKay shaking his head. ``We
don't want style, we want substance, and I'm trying to give them
substance,'' he said. ``People want to know that I understand how
government works and a lot of my ideas are the reason government
works as well as it does.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's political career began in the late 1960s, about the
time Bush left Houston for Phillips Academy, a prep school in
Andover, Mass. A well-liked lawyer and third-generation citrus
farmer from Ocala in central Florida, MacKay is a progressive
Democrat and civil rights advocate who was elected to the
Legislature as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   During three terms in the House and two in the state Senate,
MacKay developed a golden boy image. He later served in the U.S.
House, then ran twice unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Eight
years ago, McKay was among a group that convinced Chiles, then a
former U.S. senator, to come out of retirement to run for governor.
Chiles then picked MacKay as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next eight years, MacKay became the administration's
troubleshooter. Chiles put him in charge of a financial oversight
board to help steer the city of Miami away from bankruptcy. MacKay
reorganized the state's scandal-rocked Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services and coordinated relief efforts in the wake
of hurricanes Andrew in 1992 and Georges in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys conducted by Florida Voter found most voters unaware of
or unimpressed by MacKay's record. The polls indicate strong public
support for issues pushed by MacKay, such as more money for public
schools, health care reform, abortion rights. But support for
MacKay is lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Hurting MacKay's campaign was an embarrassing rift that opened
in the Democratic Party a popular African-American legislator _
Rep. Willie Logan _ was passed over for a House leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several months, several high-profile Democrats
have abandoned MacKay, and some have endorsed Bush. Among them are
the state agriculture commissioner, 16 county sheriffs and several
key legislators, including Logan.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles dismissed the impact of party disharmony. ``Fractures
like this happen all the time,'' the governor said. ``But I don't
think it affects that many voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane, the Florida Voter poll director, said MacKay's campaign
``has been struggling from day one. He's never been able to
effectively communicate his message, not only to Democrats, but to
those people who will decide the election, the persuadable
independent voters.'' &QL;

`A RESPECTABLE TRADE': UNFLAGGING INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>

   The patient, a slave named Luke, has died. The doctor turns to
the devastated young mistress of the house and tells her he'll send
the bill to Cole &AMP; Sons. ``It is a commercial loss, is it not?'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   This doctor is, despite that comment, one of the good Britons,
an abolitionist filled with guilt and pessimism. ``I believe that
slavery will be ended soon,'' he says, ``but the cruelty we have
learned will poison us forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Respectable Trade,'' a remarkable two-part ``Mobil
Masterpiece Theater'' production beginning Sunday night, almost
every character is sympathetically, painfully human. The film, set
in Bristol, England, in 1788, is the love story of a married white
woman and her black slave, but its observations are much larger.
The telling exchanges of ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' (among
class-conscious whites as well as between races) and the
under-your-skin identification with suffering of ``Schindler's
List'' are a powerful combination.
</P>
<P>
   Is it rude, for instance, for a gentleman to refuse a guest's
request for after-dinner sex with one of the host's slaves? Is it
really the responsibility of the lady of the house to choose and
fetch the woman? And how does one go about ignoring the anguish on
the chosen woman's face?
</P>
<P>
   ``A Respectable Trade'' is, first, the story of Frances Scott
(Emma Fielding), an unmarried woman who has lost her governess job
and is not wanted in the home of her high-born uncle and aunt. When
she receives a marriage proposal by mail from a stranger (in
response to a job-search letter), she decides to accept, although
the man, Josiah Cole (Warren Clarke), is much older, socially
backward and shocked to hear that there were once Romans in
Britain. And he's a slave trader. Frances accepts her fate so
cheerfully and with such good manners that we, the viewers, try to
accept Josiah, too, and root for his innocent efforts to move up
Bristol's social ladder.
</P>
<P>
   One of Josiah's plans is for Frances to teach English and
``civility'' to a small group of African slaves so that they can be
sold as house servants. Within this group, there is something
special about the man she names Moses (Ariyon Bakare). She soon
learns that his real name is Mehuru, that he was trained as a
priest in the kingdom of Yoruba and that he is the smart,
sensitive, witty gentleman she has always wanted to meet. He is
everything that her husband is not.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual attraction is evident to every black person in the
household (although apparently invisible to the whites) and
eventually consummated. From that point on, the story turns into an
almost routine romance but its intelligence never flags. Ms.
Fielding, a London stage actress, is spectacular from beginning to
end. Bakare is powerful, Clarke is endearing, and Anna Massey
brings enormous authority to the role of Josiah's stern spinster
sister who thinks all this social climbing is foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   Philippa Gregory, who wrote the screenplay and the 1995 novel on
which it is based, and Suri Krishnamma, the director, have made a
gripping and oddly, darkly charming film about the clash of old
dignity, fresh horror and the consciences of men and women whom we
sometimes excuse as being ``of their time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The man who perhaps best understands the
allure of front-running presidential candidate Hugo Chavez is the
man Chavez tried to oust from office at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chavez led a military uprising against then-President
Carlos Andres Perez. The revolt was eventually put down.
</P>
<P>
   But the driving force behind Chavez's putsch and his current
push for the Venezuelan presidency has been the clamor for honest
government and a new order of leaders to replace fading politicians
like Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Voters ``have a right to be angry and frustrated. There's a
feeling that there's nothing to lose and that someone must punish
the traditional powerbrokers,'' said Perez, who is under house
arrest on corruption charges that led to his resignation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't looking for a presidential candidate,'' Perez
said. ``They are looking for an avenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans may have found one in Chavez, a brash, cashiered
army lieutenant colonel known as ``El Comandante.'' As the Dec. 6
presidential election approaches, he is leading in the opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leader, said Jose Vicente Alvarez, a Chavez campaign
volunteer. ``He's well prepared. But the most interesting thing is
that he's not corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Running second in the polls is independent candidate Henrique
Salas Romer, a Yale-educated economist and former governor of
Carabobo state who is the favorite of Venezuela's business class.
</P>
<P>
   Though most surveys have given Chavez a double-digit lead, one
poll released last week had Salas Romer only one point behind.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Saez, the former Miss Universe and mayor of the Caracas
district of Chacao, has fallen to third place, while a handful of
other candidates have scant support.
</P>
<P>
   The winner needs only a simple plurality of the votes, since
there is no runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   Though many analysts view Venezuela's 40-year-old democracy as
ailing, they fear that the wholesale overhaul prescribed by Chavez
could make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   His power-to-the-people rhetoric, musings about stopping
payments on the foreign debt and plan to rewrite the constitution
have rattled investors and may have contributed to Venezuela's
current economic nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   In many circles, Chavez's democratic credentials are suspect.
Last month, Venezuelan intelligence officials leaked a dossier to
the media alleging that Chavez has maintained extensive contacts
with guerrilla leaders in neighboring Colombia and has organized
armed militias to guard against electoral shenanigans. Chavez
claims the document is part of a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to do with Latin American guerrillas,'' Chavez
said. ``I'm not a guerrilla. I'm anti-guerrilla. I'm a soldier for
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Chavez's promise to shake up the armed forces
has provoked rumors that officers _ led by army commander Ruben
Rojas Perez, according to Chavez _ are planning a preemptive coup
to keep him from assuming the presidency, if he wins the election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many officers admire Chavez. In fact, according to Defense
Minister Tito Rincon, two military men were detained last week for
questioning about a suspected plot to assassinate Gen. Rojas Perez,
the son-in-law of current President Rafael Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's current political and economic turmoil follows two
years of robust expansion, which had renewed expectations that the
country would begin living up to its potential as a prosperous
South American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, free-market reforms and a program to double oil
production over the next decade led to $665 million in foreign
investment and 5.1 percent economic growth. Venezuela is the
world's third-largest petroleum exporter and the largest supplier
of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, as oil prices plummeted, the bottom suddenly fell out. The
government was forced to raid the coffers of the state oil company
and cut production. Then came the fallout from Asia's economic
meltdown and pressure to devalue Venezuela's overvalued currency,
the bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are either sitting on their wallets until after
the elections or are pulling out. In the first seven months of this
year, about $4.5 billion fled the country, according to U.S.
Embassy estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Henrique Ball, who heads the manufacturers' trade group
Coindustria, forecast a 6 percent to 8 percent economic contraction
this year, which would be one of the worst performances in the past
70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even during boom years, much of Venezuela's oil wealth has been
squandered. In 1997, the Berlin-based watchdog group Transparency
International ranked Venezuela as one of the world's most corrupt
nations. Poverty is increasing, and unemployment is topping 15
percent. The annual inflation rate stands at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you explain a country with all this wealth having 70
percent of the people below the poverty line?'' asked one foreign
economist. ``They have just looted this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Chavez actually tried to trash the system six
years ago, he is the ultimate outsider. Armies of supporters show
up at his rallies wearing red berets in homage to Chavez's old
paratrooper battalion, which formed the backbone of his 1992
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   In one speech, he promised to ``fry'' the heads of corrupt
politicians in pig fat.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez wants to revamp the judiciary, cut the public work force
and diversify the economy to reduce dependence on oil. He favors
some protectionist policies for agriculture and industry and a
``grace period'' for paying a portion of the foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   To fast-track such reforms, which appear to have broad public
support, Chavez proposes closing congress and convoking an elected
assembly to write a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we continue with this rotten political system, or we
transform it through a constitutional assembly,'' Chavez said. ``It
is the participation of the people that will save us from political
chaos and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics question the legality of such a move and whether it
would make any difference, since Venezuela has had 25 charters in
187 years.
</P>
<P>
   And because Chavez has surrounded himself with an eclectic mix
of leftist economists and right-wing military officers, some of
whom attended the Pentagon's anti-communist School of the Americas,
analysts have trouble reading the tea leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not predicting a disaster,'' the foreign economist said.
``But Chavez says so many different things, and he has so many
different advisers from the left and the right that it's a
crap-shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez reminds many Venezuelans of Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez, a
populist military ``caudillo'' who ruled the nation for six years
in the 1950s and built highways and public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Chavez, if elected, would follow the path of
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Argentine President Carlos
Menem, both of whom were first elected as populists, then changed
course once in office by adopting free-market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Herrera-Vaillant, general manager of the
Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, said that an adviser to
Chavez recently told him: ``Don't worry about it. We told him to do
the populist thing in order to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez's support holds and candidates for his Fifth Republic
Movement do well in Nov. 8 congressional and gubernatorial
elections, several political parties are expected to throw their
support to presidential candidate Salas Romer in an all-out bid to
stop Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Salas Romer, a free-market advocate, favors restructuring the
nation's $43 billion debt as a way to attack inflation. He proposes
seeking help from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World
Bank to construct a nationwide railroad network, improve highways
and schools, and help farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolando Diaz, a researcher at the Latin American Institute
of Social Investigation in Caracas, said traditional political
parties are so discredited that their endorsement of Salas Romer
would be ``like a lead life jacket.''

WRITERS AS PLUNDERERS: WHY DO THEY GIVE AWAY PEOPLE'S SECRETS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murderer. Thief. Cannibal? Oh, the writer at work! Perhaps the
way authors work was most famously described in two books by Janet
Malcolm: ``The Journalist and the Murderer,'' in which she compares
journalists to confidence men who betray their subjects without
remorse, and ``The Silent Woman,'' in which she described
biographers as ``professional burglars.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see the writer at work, too, in Philip Roth's new novel,
``I Married a Communist,'' in which the main character's life is
ruined when his ex-wife writes a tell-all book about him revealing
that he is a communist. In real life, two years ago, Roth's ex-wife
Claire Bloom published a memoir accusing Roth of being a
self-absorbed misogynist who forced her to make her own daughter
move out of the house. To some readers of Roth, who has made a
career of taking elements from his life for his fiction, his new
novel about a neurotic, vengeful ex-wife, Eve Frame, is simply
payback, an act of revenge for Ms. Bloom's invasion of his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, great novelists from Flaubert to Joyce to Dreiser
have used real people as the basis for their fictional characters
at one time or another. And even when the central premise of a
novel is pure fiction, elements of it are almost always drawn from
authors' own experience _ the lineaments of a face, for instance,
scraps of dialogue or newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Couples,'' John Updike wrote a description of his
first wife's feet, and the particular way her toes curled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers have never made things up,'' novelist David Leavitt
said last week. ``All you have to do is read Proust to understand
that.'' He was speaking at an Authors Guild symposium, ``Whose Life
Is It, Anyway?,'' at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, and
he should know. Five years ago, Leavitt got into hot water when he
borrowed elements from the late poet Sir Stephen Spender's life for
his novel with a homosexual theme, ``While England Sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   After Spender threatened to sue because of copyright
infringement, calling Leavitt's work ``pornographic,'' all copies
of the novel had to be ground to pulp and Leavitt was forced to
make revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, often the ``truth'' in a work of fiction is a collection
of the tiniest fragments of reality. ``There is a significant gap
between the autobiographical writer that I am thought to be and the
autobiographical writer that I am,'' Roth writes in ``The Facts: A
Novelist's Autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that all writing is an act of betrayal or
aggression. Indeed, writing often involves an invasion, a theft, an
exposure of something private, and the issue of a writer's right to
use the lives of real people in his work has always been debated.
</P>
<P>
   Henry James, who some scholars say led a hidden life as a
homosexual, wrote on the publication of George Sand's letters to
Alfred de Musset that ``the eternal dispute between the public and
the private, between curiosity and delicacy,'' is ``the greatest of
all literary quarrels.'' James made the issue the core of his
novella ``The Aspern Papers,'' in which a nameless narrator tries
to get his hands on a famous poet's love letters.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, with a proliferation of tell-all books _ Kathryn
Harrison's memoir about having sex with her father, Mia Farrow's
memoir about her life with Woody Allen, Lillian Ross' memoir of her
affair with the New Yorker editor William Shawn _ the issue of art
vs. privacy has taken on a new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Collected Stories'' a play by Donald Margulies that is
currently running Off Broadway, a famous writer takes on a young
protegee. In talking about the art of writing with the young woman,
she admits that all writers are ``scavengers.'' She also confides
in the course of the play that she had an affair with the poet
Delmore Schwartz, only to be betrayed herself when the young woman
uses her mentor's private life in her own work. Margulies has said
the play was inspired by Stephen Spender's suit against Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deepest satisfaction of good fiction comes from the
encounter between the reader's imagination and the writer's
creation,'' Janna Malamud Smith, the daughter of novelist Bernard
Malamud, once wrote. ``It is a fluid, delicate and personal
relationship that occurs in an evanescent space.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the recent debate about the morality of authors'
using real lives in their work is a result of the expansion of the
media and its relentless appetite for true stories. Ms. Smith
argues that this trend is, at its core, a hunger for a connection
with other people that springs from a particularly modern lack of
intimacy. This hunger, she writes in her book ``Private Matters: In
Defense of the Personal Life,'' is a byproduct of a shift in
society from the rural and traditional, the ``communal,'' to the
urban, modern and separate.
</P>
<P>
   Writers feed that hunger by feeding on private lives. ``We are
cannibals,'' Cynthia Ozick admitted at the symposium. ``I think
it's a terrible thing to be a friend of, an acquaintance of, a
relative of, a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one has to wonder how English novelist Iris Murdoch
would feel, were she not suffering from Alzheimer's disease, about
the new memoir by her husband, John Bayley, ``Elegy for Iris.'' It
is a loving work but also brutally honest, describing, for
instance, her dirty hair.
</P>
<P>
   At the Authors Guild symposium, Ms. Smith remembered her dismay
when she read ``Dubin's' Lives,'' her father's novel about a
biographer, and found the biographer's daughter had taken over ``my
habit of memorizing poems.'' After her father died, and biographers
began seeking information about his private life, Ms. Smith turned
them away. ``One of the reasons novelists' relatives can become
testy about public revelation is because they have already borne
exposure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Smith admitted that her resistance might also ``come
from my own competitive wishes to write, perhaps even about him,''
she said. Her father's good friend, Roth, has already written one
novel, ``The Ghost Writer,'' about her father, using Malamud as the
basis for the character of the hermetic novelist Lonoff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares Ms. Smith's concern for privacy, however.
The singer Judy Collins, whose most recent book is ``Singing
Lessons,'' a memoir about the aftermath of her son's suicide, sees
writing as a kind of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Although writers may feel there are few moral limits to what
they can borrow from real lives, there are legal limits. Leon
Friedman, who was Spender's American lawyer in his dispute with
Leavitt and who moderated the Authors Guild panel, observed that
``under New York state law, you cannot use a person's name,
portrait or picture for purposes of trade without their
permission.'' You can, however, use a person's identity if you
don't use his name, he added.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you libel them. ``Still, for a fictional
portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of
the book would have no problem linking the two,'' said Friedman.
Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as ``the small
penis rule.'' One way authors can protect themselves from libel
suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Friedman said.
``Now no male is going to come forward and say, `That character
with a very small penis, `That's me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Copyright infringement is another obstacle, Friedman noted, as
in the case of Ian Hamilton, who tried to write a biography of J.D.
Salinger. Salinger refused to let him use his letters, and because
they were copyrighted he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Author Calvin Trillin, who has frequently used his real-life
family as the subject of his books, well knows the dangers of
appropriating the real thing. As he explained in a recent interview
about his new book ``Family Man,'' when his daughters were about 5
and 8 he asked them to sign a standard nondisclosure agreement:
``Nothing fancy. When they didn't understand why they were doing
it, I said, `Trust your daddy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some use of real-life material can be accidental.
Cynthia Ozick told of publishing a short story in The New Yorker
about a school. ``Part of my story involved my fictional headmaster
sleeping with his girlfriend,'' said Ms. Ozick. But she was stunned
to receive a call from the assistant headmaster of her own
daughter's school in which ``he questioned my morality,'' she said,
accusing her of basing her character on the real headmaster. And
then the headmaster himself threatened to sue her.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker temporarily canceled its contract with her, Ms.
Ozick said, and her publisher, Alfred Knopf, delayed publication of
a collection of stories that included the one in dispute. But then
real life had an uncanny echo of fiction when, said Ms. Ozick,
``the morality-preaching assistant headmaster left his wife and
children two years later and ran away with the school secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, writer Anne Bernays was sued when she
unknowingly used a real person's name for an unsavory fictional
character she had created. That case was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   For most writers, what matters is not the morality of stealing
from real life, but the final product: good writing at any price.
Malamud once said in an interview: ``If they are going to absorb
real people in their fiction, they ought to lay aside malice and
get their best invention going. Without invention, biographical
details remain merely strings of uncooked spaghetti.''

THE COUP THAT MADE THE CANDIDATE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALENCIA, Venezuela _ He hadn't slept for two days. His military
uprising was unraveling. And he was headed for two years in the
stockade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when army Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez faced the TV cameras on Feb.
4, 1992, to capitulate, he became a kind of Venezuelan folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in a red beret and camouflage fatigues, the charismatic
Chavez came across like a tropical Douglas MacArthur. He solemnly
took responsibility for his revolt against the scandal-ridden
Venezuelan government and announced that he, too, would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tough guy who said, ``We failed, I'm sorry, and we
will try again to throw the rascals out,' '' said Herbert Koeneke,
an economist who was one of Chavez's university professors. ``This
was in contrast to most politicians who are very reluctant to say,
``I'm to blame.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he was courageous,'' added Rolando Diaz, a
researcher at the Latin American Institute of Social Investigation
in Caracas. ``The popular image is of those three minutes he had on
TV when he gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chavez predicted, he is back.
</P>
<P>
   Cashiered from the army, he is trying to take power through the
ballot box in the Dec. 6 presidential election and is the
front-runner in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is the fruit of that event six years ago,'' Chavez
said, as he settled into a twin-engine charter plane with his wife
and infant daughter following a boisterous campaign rally in the
industrial city of Valencia. ``Thanks to the consequences of Feb.
4, I am going to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates may have better family names and wield resumes
notched with triumphs in business, law, education and politics. But
Chavez, 44, has more in common with average Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   He was born into a working-class family in the farming town of
Sabaneta, about 250 miles southwest of the capital city of Caracas.
A southpaw, he dreamed of being a baseball pitcher. Instead, he
joined the army, because it was one of the few ways for a man of
his means to move up in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez won quick promotions and became known for his integrity
and leadership. Growing increasingly restless with Venezuela's
economic decay, he formed a clandestine group of military officers
known as the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement-200, which evoked
the memory of 19th century South American liberator Simon Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the group was involved in a failed plot to kidnap
Venezuela's acting president, and Chavez was exiled to a far-away
posting on the Colombian border, according to Koeneke. Later,
Chavez assumed command of a paratrooper battalion in the city of
Maracay, from where he launched his 1992 coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion followed three years of growing civil unrest under
then-President Carlos Andres Perez. Crime was rising, and striking
workers were shutting down parts of the government. Some 300
Venezuelans were killed in rioting to protest food shortages and
Perez's free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had been unchained,'' said Chavez, reminiscing
about the early hours of the rebellion as he chewed on a clove of
ginger to soothe a throat irritated from stump speeches. ``I felt
liberated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military rebellion was going to occur. No one could stop
it,'' he said, ``because there was a state of anguish inside the
armed forces. What happened had to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who is now under house arrest in his Caracas bungalow on
charges of misappropriating public funds, said in an interview that
he had never heard of Chavez when the uprising began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unknown,'' recalled Perez, who was tipped off by
military intelligence about the impending rebellion and narrowly
escaped an attack on the national palace in Caracas. ``They tried
to take advantage of the great changes that my government was
trying to put into place to destroy the democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   While tanks and armored vehicles surrounded the national palace,
Chavez and his backers gained partial control of four major cities.
But after about 18 hours, the rebellion collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The air force, which had pledged neutrality, turned against
Chavez. Rebel communications were jammed, and Chavez's troops
failed to seize TV stations, leaving much of the population unaware
of the uprising and its aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a passive reaction from the population, because they
didn't know what was going on,'' said Chavez, who insists that 80
percent of Venezuelans supported his uprising. ``So I decided to
put down my arms and call for a surrender. It wasn't really a
defeat for us. It was a moral victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In what became known as the ``For Now'' speech, Chavez accepted
responsibility for the deaths of 18 soldiers killed in the
rebellion and implied that he would return to lead future battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrades, unfortunately, for now, the objectives we set were
not achieved in the capital. We did not manage to seize power. You
did a fine job there, but it is time to prevent more bloodshed,''
Chavez said in his address.
</P>
<P>
   After serving two years and two months in jail, Chavez was
pardoned by President Rafael Caldera and went on to form a
political party, the Fifth Republic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez isn't the only plotter who parlayed the coup attempt into
a political career. One participant, Lt. Col. Francisco Arias
Cardenas, was elected governor of Zulia state, and another is
running for a governor's post in Nov. 8 regional elections. Even
Chavez's father is trying to capitalize on his son's fame by
running for governor of Barinas state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, back in 1992, Koeneke says, people preferred overhauling
the democratic system rather than scrapping it. He cited a poll
conducted a month after the uprising showing that just 26 percent
of Venezuelans favored a military government.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of affection for Chavez ``was a reaction against
corruption and mismanagement,'' Koeneke said. ``But people were not
really supporting the coup d'etat.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many analysts claim that Chavez, who goes by the nickname
``El Comandante,'' may have a hard time adapting to democratic
rules after so many years of giving orders. For Chavez, that view
reflects an ignorance of what makes a military leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may believe that a man gives an order and the rest have to
follow it like a machine. But it's not like that,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who think it's easy, I invite them to join the army
and learn whether or not it's easy to command 500 armed men and to
maintain high morale and have them obey you _ not because you are a
lieutenant colonel, but because you are a true leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several of Chavez's role models come from the
authoritarian mold. He received a hero's welcome when he visited
Cuba in 1994. He has praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro, former
Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos and Marcos Perez Jimenez, the
last of Venezuela's military rulers who was ousted in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man wants to be a dictator. There's no other way around
it,'' said a Caracas business leader who did not want to be quoted
by name.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems to agree. While officially neutral on the
Venezuelan election, the U.S. State Department has twice turned
down Chavez's request for a visa, citing his participation in the
coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez replies that 1992 was no ordinary time in Venezuela, that
his rebellion was no ordinary coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that what has destroyed people's confidence in
Venezuela has been the corrupt and backward governments of the last
40 years,'' he said. ``I'm no putschist. We didn't make any assault
on democracy, because there was no democracy.'' &QL;

HIGH DEFINITION TV OFFERS PHENOMENAL VIEW OF THE ORDINARY 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Walking past the usual displays of Southwestern
furniture and patio accessories, the folks milling around the
Houston House Beautiful Show stopped in their tracks when they came
face-to-face with something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' one man murmured to his wife. ``My God, I
didn't think I would be able to tell that much difference, but I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman wandering by added, ``Wow. It's phenomenal!''
</P>
<P>
   The object of their attention was a high definition TV, which is
being touted as the biggest breakthrough in television technology
in the past 45 years. The product of a decade's worth of research,
HDTV offers more than twice the resolution of today's televisions.
</P>
<P>
   The HDTV on display at the home show wowed viewers with images
of forests in autumn, skyscrapers glittering at night and crimson
roses swaying in the breeze. The picture was so clear and sharp,
the experience was like looking through a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between HDTV and regular television is like the
difference between black-and-white vs. color. It's that dramatic,''
said Peter Diaz, vice president at KHOU-Channel 11, which will fire
up Houston's first digital broadcasts on Oct. 29. ``You get better
depth, sharper contrast and a sharper image.''
</P>
<P>
   While HDTV shows vast promise, the revolution looks like it will
be a complicated and awkward process.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the fancy sets are terribly expensive. The very
cheapest models will cost about $5,500, and a more typical price
will be even higher. The 34-inch Sony television on display at the
home show _ an exhibit set up by Houston-based Home Entertainment _
will cost about $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   One maker of first-generation HDTV sets, Philips Consumer
Electronics, expects to have its first model in stores in December.
The 64-inch, rear-projection television with enhanced Dolby sound
will carry a suggested retail price of $9,999.
</P>
<P>
   (Some digital sets will cost less, but they offer far less
resolution than HDTV, which is the high end of this television
revolution.)
</P>
<P>
   At more than $5,000 a pop, HDTV prices will be too steep for
everyone except hard-core enthusiasts known as ``early adopters.''
Those are people who want to be among the first to buy and own
every consumer-technology breakthrough, regardless of price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll sell some HDTVs, but I don't think the numbers will be
all that great,'' said Bill Trawick, vice president of
merchandising at Conn's Appliances, a locally based retailer. ``If
we sell 100 of them in the next year, that would be a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Houstonians aren't willing to spend big bucks
for a television. Conn's sold 1,500 projection televisions _ at an
average cost of $2,200 each _ to Houstonians during this past
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 18 million households with
televisions that cost at least $2,000. Impressive as that may be,
HDTV sets will cost more than two, three, four and maybe even five
times that much.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers, such as Home Entertainment, already have a few
HDTVs in stock. Best Buy will get its first high-definition
televisions into its stores in November, said company spokeswoman
Laurie Bauer. Best Buy will stock three separate models, and exact
prices have not yet been determined by the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is not predicting big sales at first, and our
sales will be quite low,'' Bauer conceded. ``This initial phase is
educational. We are bringing it into the store to show it to people
and explain how it works. They need to experience it to understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take years for most consumers to understand and embrace
HDTV, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is trying to deny that high definition televisions
are expensive, they will argue that prices will fall rapidly in the
future. Some manufacturers predict HDTV prices will hit somewhere
around $3,500 within the next four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if prices plunge, HDTV will extract a heavy bite out of
consumers' wallets for many years to come. But that alone isn't
half of the difficulty facing the HDTV revolution. As Bauer
mentioned, there's a lot to learn and understand about HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, buying one will be more like buying a car than
picking out a traditional analog television. It will take a chunk
of change, and making a smart purchase will require a significant
amount of research.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you bought a fancy HDTV today, what could you
watch on it? The answer is, unfortunately, not very much.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is no digital broadcast in Houston. KHOU-TV
will become the first station on the digital bandwagon with John
Glenn's historic space launch, scheduled for Thursday. The station
will begin regular digital broadcasts on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has ordered the four major network affiliates in the
nation's top 10 television markets to begin digital broadcasts no
later than May 1, 1999. Houston is the nation's 11th-largest
market. Our stations are not required to broadcast digitally until
Nov. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our owner, the A.H. Belo Corp., is committed to being first in
its major markets _ Seattle, Dallas and Houston,'' said David Carr,
director of engineering at KHOU. ``We want to take the bull by the
horns.''
</P>
<P>
   So the local CBS outlet has spent $7 million on new
transmitters, cameras and other broadcast equipment in Houston. All
of that expense and innovation is about to be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pacing like an expectant father,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that virtually no one will see his new baby doesn't
bother Carr. These first few months will be an important test of
how well all this complicated digital technology really works out
in the real world. Carr has been working on the HDTV project at
KHOU for about four years now.
</P>
<P>
   KHOU is getting a one-year jump on the Houston mandate, but the
other network affiliates aren't obligated to start beaming digital
for another 12 months. The local ABC station, KTRK-Channel 13, says
it won't be ready to broadcast digitally for another year. And some
of the smaller stations won't go digital until 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And that will put a heavy clamp on local HDTV sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to pay more than $5,000 to watch Channel 11?''
asked Trawick, the Conn's executive. ``Nothing against Channel 11,
but I don't think many people will.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear when the cable providers will begin
transmitting digital signals into homes. So some HDTV wannabes will
have to put an old-fashioned antenna on their roof to receive a
digital signal.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress has ordered local affiliates to get aboard the
digital train, it has not yet bossed the cable industry in the same
fashion. Legislators are pondering a ``must-carry'' rule for cable,
meaning the nation's cable providers would be required to provide
digital signals as part of their basic package to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable industry is very strongly opposed to any form of
digital must-carry,'' said Ron McMillan, divisional president of
Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   A must-carry rule would force cable companies to make space for
new digital signals by kicking current cable channels off the
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be very few people who have HDTV sets. We would be
penalizing the vast majority of our customers for the benefit of a
few wealthy people,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   What Time Warner and other cable companies want is another
solution _ allow them to offer a new type of digital service and
charge those who want it extra. At the end of last year, Warner
Cable completed a $140 million fiber-optic upgrade of its cable
system.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching HDTV broadcasting, the company wants to wait
until it can rollout a new digital service, which involves changing
the converter boxes in customers' homes. It hopes to be able to
start that process in the summer of 1999. That digital service
would also come with extra cable channels _ such as pay-per-view
channels and movie channels _ and would still leave room for all 78
channels the system now carries.
</P>
<P>
   But no solution is written in stone. Cable providers in some
cities haven't made fiber-optic upgrades and they aren't venturing
any guesses about how soon they'll be able to go digital.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television faces a similar compatibility problem.
Current dishes aren't equipped to pick up an HDTV signal. That
means customers would have to buy a new, elliptically shaped dish
and a converter box to pick up HDTV broadcasts. That is, until
future generations of digital televisions are made with built-in
satellite receivers. And that day may not be too far off.
</P>
<P>
   If all that sounds simple enough, consider this. Neither the
federal government nor the networks nor the hardware makers have
agreed upon a clear set of rules and standards for what digital
broadcasts will be.
</P>
<P>
   Current television broadcasts produce 480 lines of tiny dots,
called pixels, that produce a video picture. All networks broadcast
this same signal, and all televisions and VCRs are set up to
receive it. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with digital. There are at least three significantly
different digital signals that produce anywhere from 1,080 lines to
720 lines and even 480 lines. (There's also the matter of some
formats producing an interlaced rather than progressive signal, but
let's stick to the basics.)
</P>
<P>
   Different networks already have announced they will broadcast in
different digital formats. While a few digital televisions will be
able to pick up and process all of the different formats, many
won't.
</P>
<P>
   That means you may need to buy some sort of converter box. And
that means you could spend thousands on a new television and you'd
still need to buy a converter box that cost somewhere around $1,500
to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   While a converter box can dumb down a 1,080-line broadcast for a
television built to produce only 720 lines of pixels, some quality
is lost. Likewise, a converter box can beef up a 480-line signal so
it can be read by a fancy 1,080-line-producing set. But once again,
the viewer isn't getting the kind of quality that's producing so
much buzz around digital television.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone involved in introducing HDTV will tell you this is
an important obstacle. There are worries that technological
glitches will thwart the conversion process. What if you buy a
brand-new HDTV and it picks up CBS and NBC great, but the converter
gives your set fits when you try to watch Fox or ABC?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the digital revolution is an untested thing. We're
going to have to wait and see what happens. This poses some
potentially profound inconveniences for the public, which little
suspects the complexity it will soon be asked to grasp. And no one
seems to know how long it will take for a universal standard to
emerge and simplify the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``By not adopting a single standard early on, we have delayed
this whole conversion process,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of consumers who choose to wait this thing out,
the old analog transmissions will be around until at least 2006.
After the analog signals are phased out, owners of the old analog
sets will need some sort of set-top converter to receive the new
digital signals and dumb them down for their television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and buy a great analog set today, that set can
be attached to a converter box sometime in the future, and the
picture will be significantly better than it is now. Your
television will not be obsolete,'' said Mark Harris, senior buyer
and merchandise manager at Home Entertainment Inc. ``And the price
of these converter boxes will drop in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government wants to push the conversion process
along, because it plans to repossess the old analog channels and
auction them off for other uses. Proceeds of the auction are
projected to be $6 billion and already are being counted in federal
budget projections.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the complications and expense facing digital
television, it's tempting to ask: Is it worth it? Those in the
television business assure that it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect people will accept it because the picture is so
fantastic,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a great picture, the digital signal can transmit
data, which means future televisions will act more like computers.
They'll be interactive, too. Someone intrigued by a Lexus
commercial will be able to use the remote control to click on an
icon, which will connect to a Lexus Web site listing prices,
options, dealers and other useful information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many aspects to digital television and HDTV, you
can discuss it for days,'' Carr said. ``This really is the
beginning of a revolution.'' &QL;

HAUNTED BY CLOWNS: SILLY WIGS, MADCAP ANTICS ADD FUEL TO FEAR 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Phobia 1: Darke Institute haunted house in Houston,
you've got your headless torso. Your flesh-eaten corpse. Your
haunted cabinet, your goo.
</P>
<P>
   You've even got your 10-foot-tall Marilyn Manson dummy wired to
a 500-watt sound system flying at you in strobe-lighted fog.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing _ absolutely nothing _ scares people like the clown
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) touches the most nerves,'' says Kevin Campbell,
proprietor of the Darke Institute and Phobia 2: Cyberworld, two
Houston-area haunted houses operating this Halloween. ``People in
line will hear there are clowns inside, and they'll go, `Oh no, I'm
not going in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Darke Institute tour, visitors enter a cheery,
childlike room filled with clown paintings and chirpy background
music. Suddenly the lights dim; the music turns ominous. ``Evil''
clowns in diabolical masks emerge from behind doors, wanting to
make friends.
</P>
<P>
   And visitors, Campbell says, go bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to quake your way through a haunted house to
watch folks freak out over Bozo. Go to just about any circus,
school carnival or birthday party, and you'll likely find some tyke
screaming his head off as he is ``entertained'' by a large-nosed
creature in primary colors.
</P>
<P>
   What it is about clowns that prompts the neck hair to rise? Why
are clowns scary?
</P>
<P>
   And not just to 2-year-olds with stranger anxiety, either, but
to some grown-ups as well, judging from a burgeoning ``anti-clown''
culture on the Internet, where countless clown-haters have written
in to share their traumatic clown stories. Most bear as a common
theme a frightening early-childhood circus or carnival experience
involving a you-know-what. One particularly venomous site called
``Kill the Clown'' features a slow-motion bullet splattering Bozo
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Clown fear has fueled (and is fueled by) a rich cinematic
tradition of gory, blood-lusting clowns whose silly wigs and madcap
antics only serve to disguise the monster within. Think of
Pennywise, the clown in the Stephen King novel-based movie ``It,''
who was fond of hiding in sewers and dismembering children. Think
of the homicidal clown under the bed in ``Poltergeist'' and the
rouged marauders of ``Killer Klowns From Outer Space,'' who
cocooned their victims in cotton candy and sucked their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting from play horror to real horror, think of serial killer
John Wayne Gacy, who, when he wasn't sexually torturing and
murdering teen-age boys, liked to dress up as Pogo the Clown and
entertain at kids' parties.
</P>
<P>
   Think of anyone who finds it big fun to obsessively honk horns
and twist dachshunds out of balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Ronald. Clowns are creepy.
</P>
<P>
   But why are clowns _ symbolic of all things childish, whimsical
and free _ so easily metamorphosed into the macabre? Into evil?
Campbell says it's a clown's exaggerated features that make him
eerily threatening, especially that big, red mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's past the lips and the mouth?'' he asks rhetorically.
``The teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who will spend time pondering this sort of thing say
clown creepiness runs far deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that white face paint conjures up someone coming back from
the dead,'' says Cynthia Freeland, professor of philosophy at the
University of Houston. ``That paleness is very unnatural.''
</P>
<P>
   Clowns tap into deep-seated human anxieties _ about aggression,
about being out of control. Clowns don't have to follow the rules
like the rest of us, says Freeland (because, well, they're clowns).
They can do whatever they want, a concept threatening to civilized
society. With their somersaults, tiny cars and water-squirting
carnations, clowns represent the id run amok.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you free up that super ego, that moral sense, who
knows what you're letting out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that a certain violence underlies most clown
antics (unlike those of mimes, who don't scare us, being more
nearly the human equivalent of gnats).
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Three Stooges, says Garth Jowett, professor of
communications at UH. Think of slapstick and vaudeville, all of
which emanated from circus clowning. Running through them is a sly
undercurrent of cruelty, of yuk-yuks coming at another's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clown runs into the audience to throw a bucket of water,
which turns out to be confetti,'' he says. ``It's funny, but the
notion is he's going to do you harm.''
</P>
<P>
   This cruel bent dates to the days of court jesters, clowns'
predecessors, who used barbed comedy to make veiled jabs at the
king (and sometimes lost their fool heads over it). Clowns are
fine, says Jowett, as long as they keep their distance _ which they
so often don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when they become threatening,'' he says. ``They play on
people's worst fears that a person may really be deranged and not
just acting deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the scariest thing about the movie psycho-clowns (and
Gacy) is how they mine the fear that clowns might be hiding
something. That under all that greasepaint and goofiness lurks the
heart of a psychopath. Freeland still recalls being unnerved as a
child by an episode of ``The Untouchables'' in which a murderer hid
behind a hideous clown mask.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, she says, clowns scare us for the same
reason dolls, mannequins and other presumably benign fixtures of
childhood scare us. (Think of Chuckie, the maniacal movie doll that
just got married.) There's something deeply frightening about the
doll that wakes at night and turns murderous, the leprechaun that
harbors a knife in its pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Innocence twisted into evil subverts the very idea that
childhood _ indeed, the world _ can be a safe, known place. After
all, if you can't trust your doll (or the clown, or the ice-cream
man), whom can you trust? It's why the Grimm brothers' fairy tales
(especially the gruesome early versions) so efficiently struck
dread in the hearts of generations of children, Freeland says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that in the playroom are all these dark
forces lurking, ready to get you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be sound evolutionary reasons why people _
especially children _ go jelly-kneed over our suspender-wearing
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we're hard-wired to be afraid of clowns,'' says
Brian Goonan, a child psychologist with a specialty in anxiety.
``Clowns don't exist in the natural environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains: People are afraid of snakes, right? There's a good
reason for that. Many snakes are dangerous, and being afraid of
them helps us survive. What also helps us survive, he says, is
learning to monitor the responses of others. For this reason,
infants are born with an ability to read human faces. They're
really good at it. Clowns do not have human faces. Clowns have
really weird faces.
</P>
<P>
   And clowns, says Goonan, with their huge, overblown eyes,
telegraph one of three emotions to a young child _ fear, surprise
or anger. Not a good vibe for a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, which creatures in nature bear the clown's bright
colors _ the fluorescent orange, the over-the-top red? Poisonous
ones _ tree frogs, snakes, wasps. ``There's nothing associated with
(those colors) that's calm, tranquil or angelic,'' he says.
``They're more demonic.''
</P>
<P>
   Goonan is not against clowns, mind you. But parents must handle
them judiciously, he says. Know thine child. Some kids handle novel
information (that is, the clown) with ease; others don't. The
mistake most parents make is forcing the whole clown issue. (They
do this with Santa Claus, too, he says, another exotic creature.)
Slow down. Let the kid set the pace. They don't keep people out of
West Point for refusing to shake Bon-Bon's hand.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go the opposite direction either, snatching up little
Tiffany the moment her upper lip starts to quiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents will go, `It's OK, it's OK, it's just a clown!' but
their voices aren't saying that,'' says Goonan, who reminds us that
children take their emotional cues from parents. (Remember,
hard-wiring.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all clowns are hip to their inherent strangeness and the
attendant problems it can cause. Professionals in the industry,
however, readily admit to the quandary of clownophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of visits to hospital pediatric units, and the
performer will go from room to room, then get to one where the kid
just starts screaming,'' says Allen Miller with Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus. The circus recently restructured the way it
teaches performers, hoping _ as Miller says, with perhaps not the
most fortunate choice of words _ to ``put some new blood into
clowning.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Lynch, a veteran clown with the organization, says fear
of clowns can largely be blamed on inexperienced Bozos out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clowns may sometimes overdo it, come on too strong, and that's
a little frightening,'' he says. ``When it's done well, clowning
shouldn't be confusing but something wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, for one, routinely tells pressuring parents to cool it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid needs to be in control, whether it's with me or Mickey
Mouse or Barney,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yummy the Clown (aka Bill Wiatrack) of Houston's Clowns,
Characters and Critters agrees it's all in the approach, in knowing
when to hang back. People's ambivalence toward his avocation, he
says, stems mainly from the presence of ``yama clowns,'' an
industry slang term.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come up to you when you're in costume and they say,
`Yeah, I'm a clown,' when really all they've done is bought a clown
suit at Kmart and started clowning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for all those gory psycho-clown movies, Yummy takes a
dispassionate view of the bad rap clowns have gotten in the
celluloid world, where it seems that if they're not insane killers,
they're pathetic losers. That's just about irony, he says, about
turning clowns into something they're not for shock effect.
</P>
<P>
   National clown groups haven't been so stoic. They purportedly
went postal over the movie ``Shakes the Clown,'' comic Bob
Goldthwait's portrayal of a clown as an alcoholic burnout. Clown
groups redubbed it ``The Last Temptation of Bozo'' and sent in
disgruntled-clown hate-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But Yummy doesn't take it all too seriously. He even admits to
liking Krusty, the cynical, chain-smoking clown of ``The Simpsons''
fame. And he's not buying all this talk about grown-ups being
afraid of clowns. That's just a way to be ``cool,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once a group of 13- and 14-year-old boys surrounded him, saying
they were scared of clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, I'm afraid of teen-agers, so it works out fine
for us all.' '' &QL;

 &HT;    COURTROOM BATTLE IS A CLASH OF ANTITRUST TITANS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-BIOBOXES, MICROSOFT and MICROSOFT-JUDGE. Moving
in Washington (w) and financial (f) queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Across from the museum-lined Mall, camera operators
sit on lawn chairs outside the U.S. District Court, waiting for
word about the Justice Department's historic antitrust lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp. That's the only tip-off that anything
unusual is happening inside.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, the ongoing drama pits two of the nation's
goliaths of antitrust law: David Boies, representing the
government, is facing off against John Warden, lead litigator for
the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, a legendary legal hotshot, gained acclaim as the key
strategist in IBM Corp.'s decade-long fight with the government.
Warden made an equally big name for himself in lodging a brilliant
appeal for Eastman Kodak Co. that changed the course of antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these men have played key roles in shaping the nation's
antitrust law,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at George
Washington University who specializes in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes couldn't be higher. The Microsoft trial, which
Kovacic calls ``one of the most important cases of the century,''
has the potential to set the course for the nation's information
technology industry. Billions of dollars are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the lawyers' reputations are on the line. And as lead
litigators, Boies and Warden have been selected by two
talent-packed legal teams _ headed by Justice's antitrust chief
Joel Klein and Microsoft general counsel William Neukom _ to
represent their sides as the leading actors.
</P>
<P>
   Boies and Warden seem to be cut from similar cloth. Both were
born in the Midwest in 1941 _ Boies in Illinois and Warden in
southern Indiana. And they distinguished themselves early.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Boies (pronounced boys) started college at the
University of Redlands in California and went on to graduate from
Northwestern University in suburban Chicago. He graduated from Yale
Law School in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Warden had finished the University of
Virginia Law School after graduating from Harvard University, which
he entered early.
</P>
<P>
   Both made names as legal superstars in Manhattan and rose
quickly to partnerships at two of New York's top-of-the-line firms:
Boies at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore and Warden at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   Today, both live in wealthy Westchester County north of New York
City, although Warden also maintains an apartment in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To see them in court, however, is to watch opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Boies shows up every day in the same off-the-rack blue suit and
striped shirt. He dresses it up with the same blue knit tie. He's
thin, probably because sustains himself mostly on popcorn, pretzels
and diet soda.
</P>
<P>
   His style doesn't shout New York. When Georgia Pacific
executives were once told they would be meeting lawyers from
Mississippi and New York, they thought Boies was the one from
Mississippi. But his folksy delivery reflects a brilliant brain
beneath his balding scalp.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, the stout Warden, is all New York
sophistication. He wears tailored suits, Wall Street ties, and _
with the exception of his southern Indiana drawl _ carries himself
with the sophistication and assurance of someone who can hail a cab
in seconds. In fact, during the trial's first week, some spectators
perceived Warden as something of as bully as he barked questions at
Netscape Communications Corp. chief Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Boies demonstrated his oratory skills in an unscripted
three-hour opening statement before U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, punctuated with clips of Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates's videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's David's great strength,'' said law partner Jonathan
Schiller. ``He knows his evidence and he's able to foreshadow what
is coming ... and it all seems like a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars say Boies is in a good position because he
essentially wrote the book on antitrust defense during his many
years representing IBM against the government. Justice finally
dropped that case in 1982, 13 years after it was filed. Boies was
credited as a key strategist in avoiding a government breakup of
IBM. ``He knows all the tricks,'' said Kovacic.
</P>
<P>
   Boies has had his share of other high-profile cases too.
Recently he represented the New York Yankees, which led to his
decision to leave the Cravath firm, rather than give up the
cherished client. He defended CBS and the network's ``60 Minutes''
anchor Mike Wallace in a celebrated libel case brought by former
Gen. William Westmoreland. He recovered $1 billion from financier
Michael Milken for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. In the
South, he's played a key role guiding Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s
strategy in a string of dioxin cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a laser,'' said longtime assistant Linda Carlsen.
``That's what makes him so disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden is no newcomer to center stage either. In the 1970s, he
was selected as a young superstar to work on one of Kodak's most
important antitrust appeals. In Berkey Photo vs. Eastman Kodak, a
jury assessed a penalty of about $88 million against the film
manufacturer for using its market dominance to expand its market
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying because we had a monopoly position we were
obligated to tell our competitors about changes in our product that
could alter the course of competition,'' recalls Kodak deputy
general counsel David Wier. It was a case with strong similarities
to the Microsoft suit, and Kodak won the appeal, largely because of
Warden's argument that monopoly companies shouldn't be restrained
in their ability to develop proprietary products.
</P>

   Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell's chairman Ricardo Mestres, whose firm has

 &HT;    COURTROOM BATTLE IS A CLASH OF ANTITRUST TITANS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-BIOBOXES, MICROSOFT and MICROSOFT-JUDGE. Moving
in Washington (w) and financial (f) queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Across from the museum-lined Mall, camera operators
sit on lawn chairs outside the U.S. District Court, waiting for
word about the Justice Department's historic antitrust lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp. That's the only tip-off that anything
unusual is happening inside.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor, the ongoing drama pits two of the nation's
goliaths of antitrust law: David Boies, representing the
government, is facing off against John Warden, lead litigator for
the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, a legendary legal hotshot, gained acclaim as the key
strategist in IBM Corp.'s decade-long fight with the government.
Warden made an equally big name for himself in lodging a brilliant
appeal for Eastman Kodak Co. that changed the course of antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these men have played key roles in shaping the nation's
antitrust law,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at George
Washington University who specializes in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes couldn't be higher. The Microsoft trial, which
Kovacic calls ``one of the most important cases of the century,''
has the potential to set the course for the nation's information
technology industry. Billions of dollars are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the lawyers' reputations are on the line. And as lead
litigators, Boies and Warden have been selected by two
talent-packed legal teams _ headed by Justice's antitrust chief
Joel Klein and Microsoft general counsel William Neukom _ to
represent their sides as the leading actors.
</P>
<P>
   Boies and Warden seem to be cut from similar cloth. Both were
born in the Midwest in 1941 _ Boies in Illinois and Warden in
southern Indiana. And they distinguished themselves early.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Boies (pronounced boys) started college at the
University of Redlands in California and went on to graduate from
Northwestern University in suburban Chicago. He graduated from Yale
Law School in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, Warden had finished the University of
Virginia Law School after graduating from Harvard University, which
he entered early.
</P>
<P>
   Both made names as legal superstars in Manhattan and rose
quickly to partnerships at two of New York's top-of-the-line firms:
Boies at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore and Warden at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell.
</P>
<P>
   Today, both live in wealthy Westchester County north of New York
City, although Warden also maintains an apartment in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   To see them in court, however, is to watch opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Boies shows up every day in the same off-the-rack blue suit and
striped shirt. He dresses it up with the same blue knit tie. He's
thin, probably because sustains himself mostly on popcorn, pretzels
and diet soda.
</P>
<P>
   His style doesn't shout New York. When Georgia Pacific
executives were once told they would be meeting lawyers from
Mississippi and New York, they thought Boies was the one from
Mississippi. But his folksy delivery reflects a brilliant brain
beneath his balding scalp.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, the stout Warden, is all New York
sophistication. He wears tailored suits, Wall Street ties, and _
with the exception of his southern Indiana drawl _ carries himself
with the sophistication and assurance of someone who can hail a cab
in seconds. In fact, during the trial's first week, some spectators
perceived Warden as something of as bully as he barked questions at
Netscape Communications Corp. chief Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Boies demonstrated his oratory skills in an unscripted
three-hour opening statement before U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, punctuated with clips of Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates's videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's David's great strength,'' said law partner Jonathan
Schiller. ``He knows his evidence and he's able to foreshadow what
is coming ... and it all seems like a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars say Boies is in a good position because he
essentially wrote the book on antitrust defense during his many
years representing IBM against the government. Justice finally
dropped that case in 1982, 13 years after it was filed. Boies was
credited as a key strategist in avoiding a government breakup of
IBM. ``He knows all the tricks,'' said Kovacic.
</P>
<P>
   Boies has had his share of other high-profile cases too.
Recently he represented the New York Yankees, which led to his
decision to leave the Cravath firm, rather than give up the
cherished client. He defended CBS and the network's ``60 Minutes''
anchor Mike Wallace in a celebrated libel case brought by former
Gen. William Westmoreland. He recovered $1 billion from financier
Michael Milken for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. In the
South, he's played a key role guiding Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s
strategy in a string of dioxin cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a laser,'' said longtime assistant Linda Carlsen.
``That's what makes him so disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden is no newcomer to center stage either. In the 1970s, he
was selected as a young superstar to work on one of Kodak's most
important antitrust appeals. In Berkey Photo vs. Eastman Kodak, a
jury assessed a penalty of about $88 million against the film
manufacturer for using its market dominance to expand its market
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying because we had a monopoly position we were
obligated to tell our competitors about changes in our product that
could alter the course of competition,'' recalls Kodak deputy
general counsel David Wier. It was a case with strong similarities
to the Microsoft suit, and Kodak won the appeal, largely because of
Warden's argument that monopoly companies shouldn't be restrained
in their ability to develop proprietary products.
</P>
<P>
   He also won reversals of mail fraud convictions for Armand
D'Amato, brother of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and he is
defending British Airways against antitrust claims by rival Virgin
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell's chairman Ricardo Mestres, whose firm has
represented Microsoft for a decade, said Warden is a natural to
lead the defense. ``He uses a sword, not a machete,'' said Mestres.
``And he knows where to poke.''

JAMES GRANT: EDITOR OF GRANT'S INTEREST RATE OBSERVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As almost anyone with a market memory can attest, the month of
October is not usually friendly for stocks. Since 1915, the Dow
Jones industrial average has fallen an average 0.17 percent in the
10th month of the year, according to Birinyi &AMP; Associates. Only
Septembers have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   This year, September was a washout. But with one week to go,
October has proved to be the best month since January 1987. The
performance has been enough to induce hibernation in many bears.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate
Observer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Many people seem to think the stock market has seen
its lows. You don't agree?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If this were the bottom, it would be the most remarkable one
in history, one where the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is trading at
25 times earnings. That is a valuation rarely achieved at the top
of a market.
</P>
<P>
   I think that this is a bear market rally. I would suppose that
if the market gods were designing a bear market rally, they would
make it look as irresistible as possible and would want as many
participants as possible before opening the trap door. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)But there are hundreds of stocks, especially small
caps, that are down 25 percent or more this year. Are they
overpriced?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Really cheap stocks are beginning to appear. The great,
overarching question is whether you are well advised to seize
values in the secondary and tertiary parts of the market when the
primary market is selling at these multiples.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, the answer is no, because when the GEs, the Charles
Schwabs and the other chosen fall, they will crush the smaller ones
beneath them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see value anywhere?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have two favorite things: small-cap Japanese stocks and
gold. There are opportunities in Japan to buy profitable companies
at little more than the net cash on their balance sheets. You get
the business for free. Gold, now at an 18-year low, has
disappointed more people than the old Brooklyn Dodgers. But I think
it will be the beneficiary of continued chaos in the credit markets
and a worldwide economic slowdown. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see anything of value closer to home? Or a
company that is a massive, screaming short?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see both, actually.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, there is an outfit called Legacy Hotels, which is a
real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties spun
out by the real estate division of Canadian Pacific. You can buy
this stock for about half of book value, with a yield in the low
teens, an outfit with good management that is priced in Canadian
dollars, which are very cheap relative to the U.S. dollar. The risk
is that there is a severe recession and the business travelers stay
home. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What about the screaming short?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The short sale is Charles Schwab, a stock that is trading at
38 to 40 times earnings, 10 times book value. Schwab is priced as
if there were no doubt about the continued health and prosperity of
the bull market. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Now that the Fed has cut interest rates twice in a
matter of weeks, fears of a credit crunch and recession have
diminished. Is that an appropriate reaction?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The credit crisis may sound melodramatic, but over the last
several months there has been a very severe bear market in credit
of all kinds. And it should be seen in the context of the preceding
bull market in credit, where it was freely, if not almost
promiscuously, available.
</P>
<P>
   There is no recession we know of right now, and yet we have had
a credit crisis in this country, which in the postwar period is a
rare if not unique occurrence. It makes you wonder what will happen
to this institution of borrowing and lending if there is an actual
deflation, or an actual recession. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)But isn't it the Fed's job to take steps to prevent
a credit crunch?(end italics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It has been the suppression of cycles that paradoxically has
created a lot of the volatility we have seen in the credit markets.
By succeeding in perpetuating the expansion, the Fed has failed in
the sense that it has changed the behavior of people with money.
</P>
<P>
   By saving Mexico a couple of years ago, the authorities changed
the way people view sovereign credit risk. Hence the surprise when
the Russian government defaulted. A visitor from Mars would not
have been surprised that a country without money could not pay its
bills. But many were surprised, because they had come to expect
that the integrity of the system will be defended.
</P>
<P>
   By suppressing the volatility of the credit and business cycle,
by trying to head off price inflations and deflations, the Fed has
thrown a boomerang in the air, which is the risk tolerance of
people who invest money.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed ought to be in the business of central banking, not
central planning. Alan Greenspan ought to say that people who risk
money stand to lose a lot of it. That is in the nature of cycles
and markets.

WHEN VERBAL RESISTS VISUAL: FREUD'S DEFENSE AGAINST ART  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the end of the exhibition ``Sigmund Freud:
Conflict and Culture'' at the Library of Congress, a slow, weak,
singsongy voice can be heard: ``I started my professional activity
as a neurologist ... I discovered some new and important facts of
the unconscious in psychic life ... I had to pay heavily for this
bit of good luck. ... Resistance was strong and unrelenting ... the
struggle is not yet over.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Freud speaking. The year is 1938, a year before he died,
when the BBC made a recording of him. Gallerygoers stand straining
to listen, even though it would be far easier to read the text.
Why? Because this is the first and only time in the show when Freud
can be absorbed directly with the eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture'' certainly does present a
conflict, but it is not the one people might have expected. Two
years ago, the Library of Congress suspended work on this
exhibition. Although the library said the postponement was only for
lack of money, that didn't stop rumors that Freud's critics, by
circulating a petition against the exhibition, had forced the
curator to go back to the drawing board to find a more negative
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the exhibition has opened, it is clear that the
critics' wish has gone largely unfulfilled. True, there are witty
passages about psychoanalysis sprinkled throughout the show, some
critical, some merely quizzical, by everyone from Frederick Crews
and Germaine Greer to Karl Kraus and Freud himself. Printed very
high on the walls, they appear like the ghostly superego of a show
whose healthy, robust point is that Freud, like it or not, has had
an extraordinary influence on our culture, from Thurber to Popeye,
Gershwin to The New York Review of Books. And who can argue with
that?
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the show is unconflicted. It is just that in
this exhibition the fight is not between the Freudians and the
anti-Freudians. It is between Freud and the visual. Freud was, as
Michael S. Roth, the curator, concedes, famously ``anti-visual,'' a
trait that could have something to do with the Jewish prohibition
against worshipping graven images.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in other words, no mistake that Freud championed a
talking cure rather than a looking cure.
</P>
<P>
   Freud had ``an intellectual defense against art,'' said Donald
Kuspit, an art historian, speaking at a meeting of the
International Institute of Object Relations Therapy, which
coincided with the opening of the Freud exhibition. When Freud
wrote about Michelangelo's Moses, for example, he treated it as
``3-D literature,'' analyzing what Moses' hand gestures meant,
where in the biblical story they pointed, rather than admiring the
chisled forms. As Kuspit said, he turned ``art into text.''
</P>
<P>
   That poses a challenge for a curator: to turn Freud's words back
into art. The heart of the show is a series of manuscript pages
filled with Freud's German script, flowing confidently uphill,
spilling into the margins and occasionally interrupted by a
scratchy diagram. ``The task was to take manuscripts that people
want to see but can't read, and make them available,'' said Roth.
For Freud fans, he noted, these manuscripts have a ``fetishistic
aura.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, can be charmed by yellowing pages full of
a script they may not understand written by a historical figure
they may never have read. For non-Freudians, passages from the
manuscripts have been translated and blown up onto colored cards
and explicated by the curator. But is that enough to hold the
crowd's attention?
</P>
<P>
   The pull of the visual against the verbal becomes evident early
in the show. A section on Freud's apprenticeship under Jean-Martin
Charcot in the late 1880s at the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris
includes Freud's German translation of one of Charcot's lectures
and a description of Freud's use of hypnosis. But something keeps
distracting the eye: the pictures of the hysterics who were treated
by Charcot at Salpetriere. One woman looks as if she is
ecstastically offering herself to God, another has her tongue out.
Very dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Freud knew well that the hysterics were fascinating, but he
resisted the seduction. In fact, he became increasingly suspicious
of the theatrics in Salpetriere. Hysterics often performed for the
camera, the wall text notes, and the most photogenic ones got all
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, Freud admired Charcot as a ``visuel,'' a man who sees,
who looks until he understands, Kuspit observed, but as time went
on, he distanced himself from Charcot's opticality. Once he began
developing his own ideas, he concluded that seeing was shallow,
while hearing went to the depths, Kuspit noted. Freud once wrote
that to dwell on the visual content of a dream is to defend against
its unconscious meaning. The point of analysis is to get beyond the
visual.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you get beyond the visual in an exhibition? Maybe you
can't. If there is anyone who should be verbally intriguing, it is
Anna O., the woman who came up with the term ``talking cure.'' But
we don't hear from her firsthand. Instead, there is a general
description of free association. That can't possibly compete with
the visual festivities just around the corner: a television screen
showing a medley of film, cartoon and television renditions of
hypnosis and free association.
</P>
<P>
   There is Woody Woodpecker hypnotizing himself and Fred
Flintstone hypnotizing Wilma. A clip from ``Get Smart'' has Maxwell
free-associating for the Chief, giving ``girl'' for ``boy'' and
``white'' for ``black,'' followed by a scene from ``Dark Mirror''
in which a woman free-associates ``night'' for ``dark,'' ``beams''
for ``moon'' and ``scissors'' for ``knife.'' Then, it's on to
``needles'' and ``pins'' from the movie ``Marnie.''
</P>
<P>
   There are six other visual medleys (one at the end of each
section), produced by Sam Serafy to illustrate Freud's main
concepts, and they are all hilarious. Dick Van Dyke, Popeye and
``Peanuts'' take on the perils of interpretation. The work of
transference is accomplished by Bill Murray in ``What About Bob''
and by Jessica Lange in ``Francis.'' Salvador Dali's surreal
sequence in ``Spellbound'' represents the mechanics of dreaming.
Repression is handled by Fred Astaire in ``Carefree'' and by Homer
Simpson. Laurence Olivier's Hamlet illustrates the Oedipus complex
by making out with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of thing, Roth said, ``reminds people they know
something about Freud.'' Of course, they may be missing something,
too. Because Freud is a verbal animal, such things as Freudian
slips, jokes, dream interpretations, case histories, humor, wit and
infuriating logic must all be read to be appreciated. That leaves
the show in an awkward position. What is most Freudian cannot be
shown and what can be shown is not really all that Freudian.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Freud's dream theory. The show includes a
picture of the house where Freud dreamed the dream at the center of
``The Interpretation of Dreams.'' But his analysis of it, which
shows his brilliant train of associations and the self-justifying
logic beneath them, is not given.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Freud's most famous patient, the Wolf Man? The show
includes a painting he made of his own dream, a photograph of him
and even his death mask. But the reason we're looking at these
items is Freud's analysis of the Wolf Man's dream _ that the white
wolves in a tree represented his having seen his parents have sex
when he was an infant _ is not here.
</P>
<P>
   And so the first half of the show passes dutifully from free
association to interpretation, transference to dreams, repression
to the Oedipus complex, presenting all the documentation, defining
essential concepts, throwing in a picture of Freud or two for good
measure and putting in some visual touchstones. And all the while
everyone in the crowd is waiting for a turn at the next television
set.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the show, Freud's followers enter the
picture, bringing some new blood. There are photographs of
international psychoanalytic congresses, home movies of Freud's
followers and books by defectors. And thank goodness that when
Freud made his historic visit to the United States, he sent an
excited, childlike telegram in English, with a misspelling, to his
wife Martha: ``Succesful!''
</P>
<P>
   When Freud shifts his focus from the individual to the social
psyche, there is a vast desert of manuscripts: ``Totem and Taboo,''
``The Future of an Illusion'' and ``Civilization and Its
Discontents.'' Indeed, there is so little visual material that
during a discussion of Darwin's effect on Freud, a picture of Freud
with his dog in his study seems to be working as an illustration
for the bestial element in man. Slowly, though, the impending world
war starts to show in Freud's work: ``A Word About Anti-Semitism,''
and a diary entry on a book burning in Berlin, a work called ``My
Subconscious Jewishness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Freud decides he can no longer live in Vienna. It is
pathetic to see a picture of the old man suffering from jaw cancer
being taken to England on the arms of two friends, and it is even
sadder to see film and a photograph of Freud's sisters who were
left behind and murdered in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's last book was ``Moses and Monotheism.'' And after seeing
this exhibition, it seems a fitting end. As the show points out,
Freud closely identified with Moses and particularly with the
moment when he brought down the tablets, only to be confronted with
his followers worshipping the golden calf. One can only imagine
Freud's reaction at catching a glimpse of his followers gathered at
a television set while Homer Simpson explains repression.

ECONOMIC VIEW: EVEN AMID HI-TECH REVOLUTION, EVOLUTION IS THE
NORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The New Economy is on trial here along with
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the company is the one in the dock. But the outcome of the
case against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how the
doctrine of antitrust will apply to high-technology fields like
computer software. And the software industry is seen as being at
the forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies and
markets that define the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Economy, people live on Internet time and product
cycles are measured in months, not years. It is the slice of the
economy driven by entrepreneurs, stock options and network effects.
Silicon Valley is its headquarters, with subsidiaries in Seattle,
Austin and elsewhere. It is the future, its proponents insist,
coming to your home soon.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft wins, the digital age will unfold as a free-fire
zone of let-'er-rip capitalism, for better or worse. If Microsoft
loses, courts or the antitrust watchdogs may be getting their oars
into such complex matters as product design, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Let the courts decide. But for an analytic examination of
struggle and competition at the edge of the New Economy today, a
new book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and
Its Battle with Microsoft'' (The Free Press), offers some
intriguing insights. The book, written by Michael A. Cusumano, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard Business School, was placed in evidence at the Microsoft
trial last week.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft points to passages in the book in
which executives of Netscape Communications are quoted speaking
candidly about their missteps. Microsoft calls these statements
proof that Netscape's travails in the Internet browser market were
its own doing, not because Microsoft was acting like a nasty
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book as a whole reads as a coming-of-age account of the
triumphs and setbacks of a fast-moving Internet pioneer daring or
foolish enough to take on the dominant company in computing.
Netscape's experience teaches as much about what hasn't changed as
what has.
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental lesson is that even revolutionary technologies
take time to cause a revolution. No matter how great the tail wind
of hype and venture capital, the Next Big Thing takes time to
change the practices and habits of companies and people. ``Netscape
got too ambitious and too wedded to the belief that the Internet
revolution would change everything tomorrow,'' Yoffie explained.
</P>
<P>
   The threat Netscape posed to Microsoft was that its browser
could serve as an alternative ``platform'' to Microsoft's Windows.
In other words, the browser could take the place of Windows as the
first thing users see when they start their computers and as the
departure point from which applications could be started.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a long time for a new computing platform to catch
hold, as thousands of software programmers gradually become
converts and write applications that work with the new platform. By
often and publicly declaring that it was going to challenge
Microsoft head-on, Netscape aroused the software giant, which
trailed in Internet software. ``Netscape had the perfect Trojan
horse,'' Yoffie said. ``But it woke up the enemy before it was
entrenched.''
</P>
<P>
   As it matured, Netscape also found that while the speed of
product development was important, so was traditional product
quality. Netscape's freewheeling ``hacker culture'' fostered
flexibility and creativity _ one Netscape manager quoted in the
book described its development style as ``slightly out of control''
_ but also led to buggy software, a nuisance that became
problematic with more sales to quality-conscious corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the authors note, Netscape has made
strides in quality, hiring testers and increasing its use of
automated testing software. Netscape has increased its ratio of
testers to developers from one-to-five to one-to-three, though it
still trails Microsoft's one-to-one ratio. ``You can be fast and
flexible in software development, but you have to pay the price in
testing,'' Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's future is by no means assured. But for all the talk
at the trial about Microsoft trying to crush it, Netscape has done
a good job of changing its strategy to avoid tackling Microsoft
head-on whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   What Netscape, the Internet pioneer, has learned _ setting aside
the legal issues _ is precisely what the pioneers of the
personal-computer revolution learned. They declared that their
technology would change the world, but the process works in the
other direction, too. For a breakthrough technology to move into
the mainstream, it must become more mainstream _ easier, more
reliable and more useful for the workaday chores of the economy. It
does not change everything overnight.

BRADLEY'S BOOK ON BASKETBALL ALSO A CAMPAIGN DOCUMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has been making the talk-show rounds with his
remarkable new book, ``Values of the Game.'' On its surface, it
consists of a series of reflections on the roundball life as the
the game is played from schoolyards to the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Its chapters are titled ``Passion,'' ``Discipline,''
``Selflessness,'' ``Respect,'' ``Perspective,'' ``Courage,''
``Leadership,'' ``Responsibility,'' ``Resilience,'' and
``Imagination.'' It is illustrated with wonderful color photographs
of men, women, and children playing basketball. It costs $30 and
looks as though it were designed for the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle and powerful, ``Values of the Game'' is a campaign
document _ as unorthodox and excellent as the former Democratic
senator himself. It makes the point that Bradley would make a dandy
candidate for president. Indeed, it seems to me that there is
nobody in a position to run who would serve the nation better.
Whether we can get him is another question.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the 1998 election is a
referendum on the Republican campaign to impeach Bill Clinton. It
may be so. But it is the presidential election of 2000 that will
really set the course for the new century. We ought to focus on the
nominations early, not settle for an accidental choice.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in November, the next two years are going
to stink. Clinton-hating has gotten out of hand, but the haters are
unlikely to achieve their goal. The president seems almost certain
to serve out his term. Only the next election can begin to
dissipate the poison.
</P>
<P>
   We all have our theories of how this happened. Mine is that the
print media lost its self-control. The conversation about Clinton
went haywire after the last election, when the editorial page of
the The Wall Street Journal, William Safire of The New York Times,
and Stuart Taylor Jr. in The American Lawyer kicked up a notch
their discussion of ``the character issue,'' and nobody else said,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kenneth Starr, who was the stealth component of the GOP's
Contract with America, got lucky with cat's-paw Linda Tripp, and
the rest is history. ``Slick Willy'' most definitely is in the dock
now. But then so is the Contract with America.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to find points for negotiation in the polarized
discussion of Clinton and Starr. One may have to do with the
meaning of elections.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was talking last week to one of the wisest men I
know, an executive who runs much of a large corporation. ``If I'd
done that, I'd have been thrown out long ago,'' he said. ``But you
weren't elected to your position,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing how routinely this crucial distinction is glossed
over. Partnerships, corporations, nonprofits _ all exist to serve a
purpose. The purpose is sovereign, and when an leader imperils it,
he or she is ordinarily replaced by whatever group of persons is
responsible for the governance of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The goverments of democracies, on the other hand, serve no
purpose other than to enhance the public lives of their citizens,
who otherwise pursue their private goals. The will of people is
sovereign _ even in matters of law. That's why we have elections.
It is why high crimes _ and not just ``bad character'' or an
unprincipled perjury trap _ are required to reverse elections.
</P>
<P>
   There can no longer be any doubt that Bill Clinton posseses a
seriously flawed character (though whether it is any more flawed
than Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, or Nixon will be a topic of
conversation for years to come.) The next presidential candidates,
whoever they are, are going to have to run against Clinton, as much
as they must run against each other.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Vice President Al Gore offers no balm whatsoever for
the nation's wounds. The clamor for a special prosecutor to
investigate campaign finance in the 1996 presidential election
(which will be renewed after the election next month) is all about
trying to place an indelible black mark against him. Even without
it, however, Gore is almost certainly unelectable. His partnership
with Clinton saddles him with too much baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley would make an excellent Democratic Party
standardbearer. Phil Jackson, his former New York Knick teammate
and Michael Jordan's favorite coach, says in his foreword to
``Values of the Game,'' ``It seems strange to me that most readers
of this book will know Bill mostly as a politician, and never had
the opportunity to see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   But those with long memories immediately will recall his college
careeer at Princeton (and the wonderful John McPhee storybook, ``A
Sense of Where You Are,'' that described it). They will remember,
too, his years as a mainstay of the Knicks, especially the
championship years of 1970 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has been in the public eye since McPhee's text appeared
in The New Yorker in 1965. Like Bill Clinton, he was a Rhodes
scholar, but there the resemblance ends. Bradley joined the Air
Force for a time after Oxford, served as team representative of the
Knicks to the players' union during the 10 years he played in the
NBA. In 1978 he was elected to the US Senate from New Jersey, and
served three terms. He stood down in 1996, saying, ``I think
sometimes giving up power is a form of power.''
</P>
<P>
   On economic issues, Bradley is pretty widely acceptable. True,
he opposed the Kemp-Roth income tax cuts that inaugurated the
Reagan Era. But in 1986 he rose to real prominence, co-sponsoring
with William Roth the 1986 tax simplification act _ with its two
simple brackets and few loopholes _ that became the centerpiece of
the brief-lived golden age of tax equity, which was ended by Bill
Clinton in 1993. Thereafter, Bradley became a leading expert on
global economic coordination.
</P>
<P>
   On social issues, too, Bradley possesses traits of character
that recommend him to the religious right, even though his views on
social issues are relatively liberal. Though he represented New
Jersey in the Senate, he never severed his Missouri roots (he was
raised in Crystal City, 30 miles south of St. Louis). Long before
it was fashionable, he was a leader in the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The rap on Bradley is that he's just too low-compression to
compete succesfully in a sound-bite campaign. The flip side is that
he can come across as downright Lincolnesque. He has reactivated
his fund-raising operation, and hired a political aide or two. He
says he will make the decision later this year whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   If, as seems likely, the 2000 campaign is going to be run on
personal rectitude, Bill Bradley is more virtuous than George W.
Bush, the former owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and
current governor of the Lone Star State. The star athelete vs. the
owner? Isn't that an easy choice to make?

BOSTON GLOBE NAMES NEW COLUMNISTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 NO BYLINE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin announced
Thursday that Globe State House reporter Adrian Walker and White
House correspondent Brian McGrory have been selected to become
Globe metro columnists.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory and Walker, both 36, have extensive experience covering
local news, government, and politics, including some of the biggest
stories the Globe has reported since both men joined the newspaper
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian and Brian arrive at these jobs from different
perspectives and backgrounds, but both are well-trained, widely
experienced journalists who will add richness and texture to our
local news presentation,'' Storin said in an announcement to the
newspaper's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and McGrory will join Eileen McNamara, the Globe's
Pulitzer Prize-winning metro columnist, in writing twice-weekly
columns that appear on the Globe's Metro/Region front.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said that together with McNamara, who won the Pulitzer
for commentary in 1997, the two new columnists ``will give us a
dynamic lineup of metro columnists.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara will write her column for the Sunday and Wednesday
editions. McGrory's columns will appear on Tuesdays and Fridays,
while Walker will write for the Thursday and Saturday papers. Both
new columnists are scheduled to start the week of Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory and Walker will fill vacancies created by the
resignations earlier this year of columnists Patricia Smith and
Mike Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was asked to resign in June after she admitted fabricating
characters in four columns. Barnicle's resignation was requested in
August after he acknowledged that he did not know the identity of
characters he quoted directly in a 1995 column about two children
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory, who has covered the White House for the Globe since May
1996, was raised in Roslindale and Weymouth. He is a 1984 graduate
of Bates College. After working as a reporter at the Patriot Ledger
of Quincy and the New Haven Register, McGrory joined the Globe in
1989 as a reporter in the South Weekly section. He moved to the
metro staff in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a native of Miami, attended Florida &UR;  &LR; International
University before joining the Miami News as an editorial assistant
in 1986. He became a general assignment and police reporter in
1987, and came to the Globe in 1989 as a general assignment
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The bylines of McGrory and Walker have appeared above numerous
major stories in the Globe in recent years. Walker was a member of
the Globe's urban team. Both men covered the 1993 Boston mayor's
race. After that, Walker remained at City Hall, where he became the
Globe's bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 he became the paper's deputy political editor.
After helping oversee the Globe's 1996 election coverage, he moved
to the State House to cover government and politics. He is now
covering the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 months before his assignment to the Globe's Washington
bureau, McGrory was the paper's national reporter, writing articles
and features from 25 states. In the last 2 1/2 years, McGrory has
hopscotched the nation and the world covering the Clinton
presidency, including the controversy over Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Storin, in announcing the selections, said, ``I like the fact
that Adrian was a police reporter in his early career and Brian
started at the Globe covering the South Shore. They've had more
glamorous beats since, but those experiences are important too.''
</P>
<P>
   On the metro front, Walker and McGrory will be joining McNamara,
who in addition to her Pulitzer has been awarded the Distinguished
Writing Award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
McNamara started at the Globe in 1976 as an editorial secretary
before embarking on a distinguished reporting career. She has been
a columnist since August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, both new columnists expressed delight about their new
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to take on an assignment that many consider the
greatest on a newspaper,'' Walker said. ``It's at once a huge
challenge, a great privilege, and an amazing opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Added McGrory: ``I look forward to getting back to Boston, the
greatest city in the country and a place where real people actually
care about real things. The challenge ahead is to find those things
people care about most and to tell their stories.''

LUNGREN HAS NEW STRATEGY IN CAMPAIGN AGAINST DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLOVIS, Calif. _ As the gubernatorial campaign enters its final
days, Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren has jettisoned his
soft-on-crime attacks against Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and
shifted focus to Davis' ties to organized labor and trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's new strategy is an attempt to focus his own campaign
on the economy and jobs, issues that may play better with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren had been bombarding the state with advertising
questioning Davis' position on the state's ``three strikes'' law
and the death penalty, saying Davis is lying when he claims to have
fought for the measures. But Lungren's message doesn't seem to be
getting traction, and Davis appears to be holding the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of new television commercials carefully tailored for
different parts of California, Lungren questions whom Davis would
represent if elected governor, and raises Davis' support from trial
lawyers ``who gave millions to allow frivolous lawsuits that will
destroy California business and jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lungren is continuing to question why Davis never took a
position on Proposition 211, which would have allowed class-action
lawsuits against a company if its stock fluctuated.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent editorial board meeting with the San Francisco
Examiner, Davis said he probably should have opposed the 1996
ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley called the measure a job killer, but it was
sponsored by San Diego class-action lawsuit lawyer Bill Lerach, who
has donated about $400,000 to the Davis campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop Thursday at Pelco, an 800-employee
company near Fresno that makes security cameras, Lungren said
Davis' support from trial attorneys, which totals $2.4 million this
year alone, led to his silence on the initiative, and will lead to
more lost jobs if Davis is governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public sees a difference between those who create jobs _
those who are employers _ and those who make it difficult to create
jobs,'' Lungren said. ``And there is no doubt in anybody's mind
that the liberal plaintiffs' trial bar would have killed high-tech
jobs all over this state with excessive, abusive litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent San Francisco Examiner poll showed Davis with a
six-point lead over Lungren among those surveyed. Lungren is going
after conservative Democrats and independent voters with his new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   As the state's highest law enforcement officer, Lungren had
serious credentials going into the race to talk about cutting
crime, now at a 32-year low. But Davis scored the biggest coup of
the campaign by landing the endorsement of the prison guards union,
which has already begun a powerful series of commercials for Davis
titled ``Ask a Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lungren has to do is peel away some support from Davis
from conservative Democrats,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey
director for the San Francisco-based Public Policy Institute of
California. ``Usually, Republican candidates have been able to do
that in a state where the Democrats have a bit of a dominance. But
it's been more difficult this time around. So (Lungren) is going
down the list of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, the Davis campaign manager, said this is about the
fifth strategy he has seen from the Lungren campaign, which at
various times has tried to link Davis to his onetime boss, former
Gov. Jerry Brown, and to President Clinton's character troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've described it as throwing various colors of Jell-O at the
wall and seeing what sticks,'' South said. ``He's been flopping
around.''

DALLAS EXPERIMENTS WITH NEW 311 NONEMERGENCY SYSTEM 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It doesn't happen every day, but a horse could wander
into your back yard and die. Who to call. Police? Sanitation
Department? Animal Control?
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, residents of Dallas haven't had to worry
about it, thanks to a new system of one-stop shopping for municipal
services.
</P>
<P>
   Forget having to memorize whether mosquito control comes under
Health or Environment. Forget the agate type in the phone directory
blue pages and the bewildering roster of bureaucracy. What exactly
does the Board of Adjustment adjust?
</P>
<P>
   Just by dialing 311 _ a number that has done for weed abatement
what 911 did for robberies in progress _ you can report a broken
water line, a barking dog or sloppy trash collection. You can
arrange for time payment of high summer water bills, find out who
your representative is on the city council, complain about traffic
violators, check bus schedules or inquire about personal property
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is one of three cities in the United States to experiment
with a three-digit, nonemergency number and the city council was
told last week that based on the first 10 months of trial, it is
doing pretty much what it was intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose, said Raymond Sweeney, the fire department
captain who runs the city's communications center, was to shrink
the maze that often traps taxpayers with a municipal problem. In
frustration, large numbers of them resorted to calling 911 with
nonemergency requests or complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one number replaces 28 separate department numbers and
seven dispatch centers,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to 911 have been reduced by 15 percent compared to fiscal
year 1996 and the wait time has been cut in half; operators now
answer, on average, in five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has improved the level of access for citizens,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Operators ask callers a series of ``scripted questions'' and key
the answers into a computer, which routes the call to the
appropriate city department.
</P>
<P>
   The 311 system was installed late last year, when the city was
replacing its aging 911 switch. Of the $4.5 million cost of the new
switch, about $500,000 was spent on the 311 function.
</P>
<P>
   Both 911 and 311 calls are received by the same communications
center, where they are automatically sorted by priority, with those
on the emergency line answered first.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore and San Jose, Calif., also have installed 311
switches, but they are for nonemergency police and fire calls only.
Sweeney said officials from Baltimore have visited Dallas'
communications center and apparently are considering adapting their
own 311 system to enhance public access to city government.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cities _ Austin, Los Angeles and San Diego among
them _ have also inspected the Dallas system.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has not. Even without an alternative number to relieve
traffic on emergency lines, Houston has not had a problem with
delays in answering 911 calls, said Barbara Evans, who manages the
city's 911 system.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 20 percent of our calls are nonemergency,'' she said.
``But the wait time is three seconds. We answer 99.9 percent of the
calls in 1{ rings.''
</P>
<P>
   As for access to city government, the city already has operators
who will help residents find the right department, said Dan Jones,
a veteran of the Houston's public works agency and now an assistant
to Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call 754-0600 and the operator will stay on the line
with you until you get to the right person,'' he said. ``They don't
hand you off.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many people can remember the number? &QL;

UT BOARD OF REGENTS CONSIDER REOPENING TOWER THAT HAS CAST LONG
SHADOW OVER CAMPUS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ For several generations of students, the University of
Texas tower has cast a long, dark shadow over their campus, ever
since its observation deck was closed two dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tower is best known for the 1966 sniper attack in which
Charles Whitman killed 14 people and wounded 31. It was also the
scene of nine suicides. So in 1974 the 28th-floor observation deck
was closed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But when the UT Board of Regents meet in Houston next month,
officials could authorize the reopening of the 307-foot-tall
landmark with new safety features.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, the opening would come over the objections of
current and former students who still associate the tower with
tragedy and danger. Yet, the proposal has many supporters, and it
follows months of spirited local debate and deliberations by UT
President Larry Faulkner and regents.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner this week is putting finishing touches on a proposal
that could be considered at the regents' meeting on Nov. 11-12. His
tentative plans call for installing a protective structure to
enclose the deck, with bars that would prevent people from falling
or jumping off of the tower. Faulkner also is pondering details
such as security measures, hours of operation and whether to impose
an admission fee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, some regents toured the open-air deck and
viewed a test section of the enclosure that is being contemplated.
With the regents' concerns duly noted, the final design is being
drafted along the related plans for security and access. Faulkner
said he expects to disclose the package by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're holding a place for it on the agenda,'' said regents'
spokesman Monte Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After its opening in 1937, the tower _ just 4 feet shorter than
the nearby Texas Capitol _ became one of Austin's biggest tourist
attractions, affording visitors a free and stunning view of the
university, the capital and surrounding region. Known as the Main
Building, the tower has been the bustling epicenter of the campus
throughout its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Its steps have served as a forum for debates and rallies, and as
a backdrop for commencement exercises. Once the main campus
library, the building's first few floors house top administrators'
offices while upper floors store archives. Topped by 40,000 pounds
of bells, its exterior limestone walls are bathed in orange
floodlights for major sports victories and other campus
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The tower carries so much symbolism for UT that it is the
subject of a college course, ``The UT Tower and Public Memory,'' in
the division of rhetoric and composition. Rosa Eberly, who teaches
the course, penned an essay for the Austin American-Statesman
saying the decision process for the tower's reopening is a test of
the university's maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``After more than 30 years of institutional repression and
silence, UT has been presented with an opportunity to come to terms
publicly with one of the most troubling incidents in its history,''
Eberly wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than whether the observation deck is reopened,
the university can show through the openness with which it handles
the question that it has, at least institutionally, begun to heal
and move beyond the violent effects of Charles Whitman's actions in
1966 and the enduring pain of those who witnessed or were otherwise
affected by the several suicides there,'' Eberly said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1966, the tower was like a lofty deer blind for
Whitman, enabling him to mow down pedestrians blocks away and lay
siege to the campus area for 90 minutes before he was slain in a
shootout on the deck by Austin police. Unnoticed, in an era of lax
security when mass murder was still a rarity, he had managed to
take a foot locker full of armaments onto the deck, including three
rifles and 700 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Kelly, a 58-year-old Austin businessman, was one of
the survivors who was pinned down during Whitman's gunfire toward
``The Drag,'' or Guadalupe Street. The horror he witnessed was so
intense, it caused him to drop out of UT as a senior, and still
bothers him. The notion of reopening the tower gives him mixed
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have died since they closed the tower? Zero,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was on campus for his daughter's graduation 10 years
ago, he noticed he still had ``a very uncomfortable feeling. I had
that one-eye-on-the-tower type feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were there and you witnessed that kind of trauma, it
just never leaves you. If I'm on the campus, I still look over my
shoulder because you never know. Just think about being in the
crosshairs of a sniper's rifle scope,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged there may be enough student support and
political resolve to reopen the tower, and there may be a way to
make the tower a safe place to view Austin again. But he said the
campus' history of suicides, more than anything, should be the
overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the gimmick is to prevent people from jumping, then
it would be fine with me,'' said Kelly, adding that those intent on
suicide have other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess people could go up to the top of Royal-Memorial
Stadium and take a flying leap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last suicides left an indelible impression on Kelly
and other students at the time. In 1972, a despondent female
student jumped over the observation deck's stone railing, leaving
behind her shoes with a suicide note tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   A chilling photograph, published in the campus newspaper, is
etched in Kelly's memory and prompted him to express his concerns
about reopening the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``She put her shoes neatly on the wall,'' said Kelly. ``That was
the image in my mind,'' he said. ``That was traumatizing _ almost
as much as being on the campus that day, Aug. 1, 1966,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the last suicide on Oct. 28, 1974, the deck was finally
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he disagrees with students who want to counterbalance
the tower's possible reopening by creating a memorial to Whitman's
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, that would glorify the Charles Whitmans of the
world, and I think the monument is the tower itself,'' he said.
``It's certainly symbolic of academic excellence, but it's also
symbolic of evil.'' &QL;

 &HT;    With MIDEAST-DEAL-1024.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ For just about every Palestinian on this
city's streets, there's something very practical in the Middle East
peace agreement signed Friday -- freer movement and maybe reunions
with family.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, the deal offers at least the promise of less
terrorism, and they appear ready to accept that.
</P>
<P>
   Both are skeptical. They have been burned by the promises of
peace in the past and they want to see the deal transformed from
paper to real life.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo peace talks were based on a trust-building process,
which had largely broken down during a 19-month stall.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher issues, like the final borders of the Israeli and
Palestinian lands, lie ahead and will take a lot of trust.
</P>
<P>
   For now, maybe even more than the land that will be turned over
-- which is largely unpopulated -- Palestinians could see the
difference in the simple freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Most would be allowed to travel through Israel between the West
Bank and Gaza Strip without special permits and humiliating
security searches. That is expected to help flagging economies in
those areas and let students get to universities without fear of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, the new Palestinian airport will be allowed
to open. It is already built, and the first Palestinian airliner is
parked in Jordan waiting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gazans have to drive to Egypt or get complicated approvals
to fly from Israel's airport near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Of top priority, Israel committed to releasing several hundred
of the 2,400 Palestinians now held.
</P>
<P>
   Being a prisoner in an Israeli jail has long been considered a
badge of nationalist honor among Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In a T-shirt and jeans and hanging out with others on a busy
Friday night in Ramallah, Mohammed Sharakeh noted that he is free
because of the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in 1988, he was sentenced to life in prison for
killing a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with the Israeli
occupation -- a crime he does not hesitate to admit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Oslo negotiations, Sharakeh was released in 1994.
Now, 26 years old, he recently married and has a job in the
Palestinian security forces. He looks forward to the other
prisoners being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be some of my friends,'' he said. ``Of course, I
support that the Oslo process continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a man in a blazer walks by with his wife and toddler
son. Qadura Faris, a Palestinian legislator who himself served 14
years in Israeli jails for being in an anti-Israel military cell,
was released with Sharakeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a positive revolution in their lives,'' Faris said
of the families with prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But, Palestinians want to see who will be released: Will they
just be those who are finishing their sentences for minor crimes?
Or, will they include some who have killed Israelis?
</P>
<P>
   ``If so,'' Sharakeh said, ``Then I will believe 100 percent in
peace because it means that the Israelis are ready to forget the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are not ready to forget the past, however. They are
concerned that the Palestinian security commitments -- which is
mostly what they get out of this agreement -- will be violated as
others have.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme right-wing leaders repeated calls for their former ally,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   But polls have shown that a majority want the deal. Left-wing
Israelis have been in favor. And even supporters of Netanyahu, who
once opposed the Oslo process, felt the agreement was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did not have an agreement, then in the next year we will
have a war. So, yes, this is an important agreement,'' said
37-year-old Avi Hawi, an Israeli contractor who voted for Netanyahu
and was at a Jerusalem cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good agreement,'' said 27-year-old mechanic Itzik
Ben-Tov, another Netanyahu supporter. ``(Netanyahu) is insisting on
every point and doesn't give anything for free.''

   In a T-shirt and jeans and hanging out with others on a busy
Friday night in Ramallah, Mohammed Sharakeh noted that he is free
because of the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in 1988, he was sentenced to life in prison for
killing a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with the Israeli
occupation -- a crime he does not hesitate to admit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Oslo negotiations, Sharakeh was released in 1994.
Now, 26 years old, he recently married and has a job in the
Palestinian security forces. He looks forward to the other
prisoners being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be some of my friends,'' he said. ``Of course, I
support that the Oslo process continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a man in a blazer walks by with his wife and toddler
son. Qadura Faris, a Palestinian legislator who himself served 14
years in Israeli jails for being in an anti-Israel military cell,
was released with Sharakeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a positive revolution in their lives,'' Faris said
of the families with prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But, Palestinians want to see who will be released: Will they
just be those who are finishing their sentences for minor crimes?
Or, will they include some who have killed Israelis?
</P>
<P>
   ``If so,'' Sharakeh said, ``Then I will believe 100 percent in
peace because it means that the Israelis are ready to forget the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are not ready to forget the past, however. They are
concerned that the Palestinian security commitments -- which is
mostly what they get out of this agreement -- will be violated as
others have.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme right-wing leaders repeated calls for their former ally,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
   But polls have shown that a majority want the deal. Left-wing
Israelis have been in favor. And even supporters of Netanyahu, who
once opposed the Oslo process, felt the agreement was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did not have an agreement, then in the next year we will
have a war. So, yes, this is an important agreement,'' said
37-year-old Avi Hawi, an Israeli contractor who voted for Netanyahu
and was at a Jerusalem cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good agreement,'' said 27-year-old mechanic Itzik
Ben-Tov, another Netanyahu supporter. ``(Netanyahu) is insisting on
every point and doesn't give anything for free.''

 &HT;    DEFICIT-CUTTER SECURES DOUBLE PORTION OF PORK FOR DISTRICT
 &HT;    550&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress patched together the huge, pork-laden
budget bill to finance much of the federal government, Rep. Zach
Wamp alerted his East Tennessee constituents to what he called a
``near-miraculous double play.''
</P>
<P>
   He and colleagues had faced down the threat of losing all
subsidies for the Tennessee Valley Authority and managed to win not
one, but two, forms of federal assistance for the power authority,
at a cost to the government that could exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A lawmaker snaring federal dollars for his home district might
seem unexceptional. But this congressman was once a firebrand
member of the Republican freshman class of 1994 that roared into
the capital promising to do away with politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those newcomers topped Wamp when it came to decrying
government extravagance. Even when a budget fight shut down much of
the federal government just before Christmas of 1995, the Tennessee
Republican dug in his heels and, appearing on ABC's ``Nightline,''
demanded that the Clinton administration accept more spending
restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so popular to overpromise and overspend,'' he said. ``For
the first time, no matter how unpopular it is, we're going to do
what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the fall of 1998, when Congress appeared on the
brink of cutting off funds for TVA's non-power activities such as
flood control. Back home, Wamp's Democratic challenger, Jim Lewis,
taunted the congressman for failing to protect TVA, which provides
jobs in his district and power to millions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp, who had gained a cherished seat on the House
Appropriations Committee that divvies up spending, went to work. He
joined forces with other members of Congress and with Vice
President Al Gore in a two-track strategy to secure funding for
TVA.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that the annual subsidy was lost, the coalition sought
federal refinancing for $3.2 billion of TVA's debt on more
favorable terms, meaning the government would lose about $1 billion
in ``forgiven'' loan payments over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wamp and others continued to try to revive the
apparently lost annual appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the giant budget package was wrapped up and signed
by President Clinton on Wednesday, both efforts had succeeded. To
the surprise of even the backers, the bill included the refinanced
loan and $50 million in annual aid.
</P>
<P>
   The TVA package brought protests from fiscal watchdog groups.
``This latest loan-forgiveness scam goes far beyond the boundaries
of responsible government and is an offense to the nation's
taxpayers,'' said Thomas Schatz, president of the non-partisan
organization Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp, who has made the group's ``taxpayer hero'' list in the
past, offered no apologies for obtaining the aid. Instead, he
joined in the criticism of the the disorderly way in which the big
budget bill was thrown together and voted against it on final
passage, even though it included the TVA assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Was he playing both sides?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you learn how the process works and you work the system
to your advantage,'' Wamp told the Chattanooga Times afterwards.
``I think that's being an effective legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Such statements seem a world apart from Wamp's freshman
declarations three years ago, when he called the budget standoff a
``defining moment in history'' and said that reducing federal
spending would have an impact on ``our kids and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wamp, who declined to give an interview for this article, issued
a written statement defending his record of balancing the budget
and voting for spending cuts and, without mentioning the TVA
refinancing deal, defended the $50 million for non-power activities
as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets about my successful efforts to make sure
that residents of the Tennessee Valley receive from the federal
government the same services _ such as flood control and navigation
_ that it provides for citizens in every other part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I did my very best to make sure the government meets
its obligations to the citizens I represent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Citizens Against Government Waste, spokesman Jim Campi
said, ``We disagree with a lot of our friends on the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Wamp is also in the forefront of another potentially expensive
federal program, a high-speed rail project to link Atlanta with
Chattanooga. He and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., have joined
to secure $5 million in federal funding for a feasibility study to
cut the ground travel between the cities to one hour. The early
cost estimate for the railway is $1 billion.

CLINTON PROMISES REVIEW OF SPY CASE TO SALVAGE PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel's explosive demand that the United States
release an imprisoned spy nearly derailed a hard-fought Middle East
peace accord Friday, with President Clinton in the end bowing to
pressure to review one of the more startling espionage cases in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   After nine days of difficult talks, the negotiations were nearly
finished when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added
Jonathan Pollard's release as a condition for a West Bank
settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli sources, Clinton initially accepted the
deal, but later balked in response to fierce opposition from
American law enforcement and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to Israel radio, Aviv Bushinsky, a spokesman for
Netanyahu, said Pollard's release was ``one element that we thought
we could obtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushinsky said Netanyahu believed that some ``sort of
understanding'' had been reached with Clinton on Pollard's release,
but that the president backed out at the last minute. The White
House denied the president had made any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage in 1986 and was sentenced to
life in prison. In his trial, prosecutors proved that Pollard, who
began spying for Israel in 1984, had taken more than 1,000
documents while working as an civilian analyst for U.S. Naval
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal to release Pollard stalled the negotiations for
several hours as Clinton and Netanyahu attempted to work out a deal
for the convicted spy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Netanyahu accepted that Pollard would remain in prison
in return for assurances from Clinton that the president would look
into releasing Pollard sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That review will be done without any commitments. There is no
time limit'' for completing it, said White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart insisted that Clinton had never promised to release
Pollard. ``Any comments or suggestions President Clinton committed
to the release _ or promised _ the release of Jonathan Pollard are
false and inaccurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the West Bank agreement, the Palestinians would eliminate
anti-Israel provisions in the Palestine Liberation Organization
charter and the Israelis would cede 13 percent more of the
territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River and free 750 alleged
political prisoners, U.S. and Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in the past has refused appeals by Israel and
American Jewish groups to release Pollard, most recently on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the court prior to Pollard's sentencing, former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said: ``It is difficult for me
... to conceive of a greater harm to national security than that
caused by the defendant in view of the breadth, the critical
importance to the United States and the high sensitivity of the
information he sold to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard spent seven years in solitary confinement at the maximum
security prison at Marion, Ill., in the harshest of prison
environments. But determined lobbying by Jewish groups eventually
convinced government officials to send him to the federal prison in
Butner, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting a pardon application two years ago, a White House
official said the president based his decision on ``the enormity of
Mr. Pollard's offenses, his lack of remorse, the damage done to our
national security, the need for general deterrence and continuing
threat to national security that he posed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Pollard's possible release immediately drew fire from
former law enforcement and intelligence officers, who said the
convicted spy compromised national security and endangered the
lives of U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact it is true, than it is a terrible signal for
everyone because it means that someone is actually rewarded for
spying for an ally,'' said Joseph diGenova, the former U.S.
attorney who prosecuted Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``no American citizen has ever been turned over to
the country for which he spied.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Halbern, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer and
currently a board member of the Association of Former Intelligence
Officers, said Pollard's crimes warrant that ``he should rot in
jail until he dies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that they would let the guy go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halbern said releasing Pollard would encourage other Americans
to spy on the United States. ``If you don't punish people for
betraying their country, it will just push other people to do the
same thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Halbern also questioned why demands on the United States were
being made in negotiations between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If moderators are now expected to give up something of their
own, I don't expect to see too many countries lining up to be
moderators in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One political scientist said the agreement to review Pollard's
case showed how desperately the president wanted a deal to be made
between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is looking for any and all opportunities to change
that paragraph in the history books that now will be about
scandal,'' said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for
Governmental Studies at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But what he hasn't realized is that it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Barr, R-Ga., who used to work for the CIA, said
Clinton's decision to review the case was a ``cynically
orchestrated political game ... that is a slap in the face to every
agent who has ever risked his life in defense of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups contended that the release of Pollard is long
overdue. ``He has served 12 years of a sentence where the minimum
term is 10 years,'' said David A. Harris, executive director of the
American Jewish Committee. ``This man has paid the price for his
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger provided the court with information detailing the
damage Pollard's espionage had on intelligence operations. Although
most of the information remains confidential, some parts have been
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Among the secrets Pollard had sold: diagrams of the PLO
headquarters in Tunis, which had helped Israel in its 1985 bomb
attack on the PLO; details of Soviet arms shipments to Syria;
information on the Pakistani program to build an atom bomb; Iraqi
and Syrian chemical warfare production capacity; and the capability
of Libyan air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But in his letter to the court, Weinberger said the most
damaging intelligence material stolen by Pollard was the
all-important ``sources and methods'' of U.S.
intelligence-gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   With this information, the Israelis, or anyone who subsequently
might obtain the data, would know the capability of American
electronic eavesdropping, the placement of U.S. strategic
facilities, the extent of code-breaking ability, and would probably
be able to learn the identities of agents and spies in various
countries.

PULP FRICTION: CLEARING DESKS OF PAPER NOT EASY  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There are high-speed scanners, computers and programs
to organize it all, but desks from the corner office to the cubicle
remain buried in paper.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in all forms: mail, faxes, memos, newsletters. Whether
it's coming or going, folks have a need for paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it a technical chasm _ making the transition from the
tangible document that we're so secure with to an electronic
copy,'' said Andrew Bates, an account manager at IPRO Inc., a
Phoenix company that scans paper documents and puts them onto
CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   While the company can put as much as 15,000 pages onto a single
disc, it makes about 12 percent of its sales by printing out
digital images for its clients, who are mostly lawyers. Sort of
making things unpaperless again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a contradiction, concedes Geoffrey Sturr, a civil
litigation lawyer with the firm Osborn Maledon.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys the efficiency and organization of having everything
on a computer, but there are times when he just prefers a document
he can hold in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still an attraction to working with paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Filing cabinets, copiers and printers remain as popular as
desktop computers. As technology improves, some are embracing what
they see as the convenience of a paperless environment, while
others cling to the comfort of familiar paper.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have long been lovers of paper, collecting huge stacks
of documents and letters for cases.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems a bit odd that Guy Bluff, who heads the firm of Guy
W.M. Bluff PC in Phoenix and handles complex civil litigation
cases, has sworn off of paper.
</P>
<P>
   All incoming documents get slapped with a bar code, scanned into
a computer network and routed to the right attorney's electronic
in-box.
</P>
<P>
   Using a $22,000 scanner, it takes about a half-hour to scan in
the daily mail for the eight-person firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are responsible for moving their mail to the appropriate
computer files.
</P>
<P>
   The firm went from running 20,000 copies a month to less than
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was phenomenal. I made money by doing this,'' Bluff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bluff, who regularly clocks in 80-hour workweeks, says the
motivation for the high-tech gadgetry was simple laziness.
</P>
<P>
   When on the phone with a client, he can punch a few keys and
bring up everything on that person's case. Instantly. There's no
digging through files. No searching for a certain piece of paper.
Nothing gets lost. Nothing gets damaged.
</P>
<P>
   If the client wants to see something in the file, Bluff can send
it via e-mail or fax before their phone call ends.
</P>
<P>
   Also, each client gets a password that allows him to check his
file on the firm's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   When Bluff heads to trial, he totes along a whopping 50-inch
television monitor. As a witness testifies, related documents pop
up on the screen with the appropriate sections highlighted in
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   A color printer is brought along in case the judge wants a hard
copy.
</P>
<P>
   The system makes life simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are getting overwhelmed with mail,'' Bluff said.
``I have nothing on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of us are more like Robert Conway, traffic
engineering supervisor for the city of Tempe. He needs a big
recycling bin to clear off all the paper covering his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of paper we could do away with, but
everybody's so used to having the paper that it's hard to break
away,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   His desk is in sharp contrast to Bluff's. It's covered with
design drawings, industry trade magazines, announcements and other
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are used to create the maplike drawings the city uses
to show where street signs and markings need to go.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for Conway to adjust to creating drawings on a
computer rather than doing it by hand. In time, he discovered it
was much easier to make changes on the computer rather than the old
fashioned way with a big pink eraser.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Conway prefers making the drawings on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of a microcosm of the world's relationship with
technology. Most folks simply don't evolve at the pace of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The way Conway sees it, the world needs a little more time
before jumping off the paper trail.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the paperless office will just have to wait. &QL;

FOR JAPANESE TOURISTS, IT'S FIRST STOP LAS VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Calif., Hawaii, Fla.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have all the Japanese tourists gone? To Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Japan's continuing economic woes and the weakness of
the yen, the numbers of Japanese visitors to California and Hawaii,
where they have been a mainstay of the tourism industry, are
falling sharply. And so is the amount they spend, amplifying a
trend that began in earnest four years ago. Even Orlando, Fla., has
seen declines in guests from Japan at its theme-park attractions.
</P>
<P>
   But not Las Vegas. The number of Japanese tourists staying there
has doubled since 1994 and rose 19 percent just last year, to
403,000. That was a year when overall visits to Las Vegas rose just
2.8 percent. Japanese guests at the gambling oasis now outnumber
those from any other country outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   The trend breaks a decades-old pattern of Japanese tourism in
the United States, and will likely accelerate now that two
airlines, Northwest and Japan Airlines, have introduced regularly
scheduled nonstop flights to Las Vegas from Tokyo's Narita airport.
Los Angeles, meanwhile, is now getting 10 fewer nonstop flights
from Tokyo a week.
</P>
<P>
   The golden triangle for the Japanese used to be Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Las Vegas, said Frank Murakami, general manager of
the Los Angeles office of the Japan Travel Bureau, Japan's biggest
tour operator. ``Now,'' he said, ``it's Las Vegas, Disneyland and
Universal Studios,'' with short side trips to those attractions
replacing extended touring or long stays in California.
</P>
<P>
   It all couldn't have come at a better time for a city trying to
reposition itself as an entertainment stop. Tourists still flock to
Las Vegas _ 30.5 million visitors last year spent almost $69
billion. But officials worry about depending so heavily on gambling
when forecasts say that by 2001 some 90 percent of Americans will
live within 200 miles of legal casino-style gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, occupancy in the city's 106,000 hotel and motel rooms
dipped last year to its lowest since 1992, and a wave of new
capacity is coming on the market: the 3,025-room Bellagio opened on
Oct. 15, and five new hotels with an additional 16,000 rooms will
be completed next year.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese tourists are prized because, while representing only 11
percent of all visitors to the United States in 1996, the latest
year for which figures are available, they are the largest group
from overseas and spent $19.3 billion, 21 percent of the total.
That compares with $9 billion by British visitors, the No. 2
overseas group, and $6.3 billion by Germans, No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   And Japanese visitors achieved their spending levels in average
stays of only eight nights, compared with 16 and 17.3 for British
and German tourists, respectively. Japanese visitors to Las Vegas
stay 3.3 days an average, and the Commerce Department says they
spend an average $192 a day in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Japanese tourists are not quite as
free-spending as before. They tend to stay in less-expensive
hotels, shop in outlet malls and gamble less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baccarat is down about 20 percent in Las Vegas this year,''
said Jim Murren, chief financial officer of the MGM Grand Hotel and
Casino, referring to the card game perhaps most closely associated
with Asian gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   If casino action is not the main attraction, why is Las Vegas
luring so many more Japanese tourists _ as many as 15 percent more
this year, according to Carlos Tello, head of the Las Vegas office
of the Japan Travel Bureau?
</P>
<P>
   One draw, perhaps oddly for a place with such a wide-open
reputation, is safety. Always more security-conscious than most
tourists, Japanese visitors regard compact Las Vegas as far less
risky than sprawling Honolulu, where rising crime against Japanese
tourists evoked a letter of protest from the Japanese consul
general to the mayor of Honolulu, or Los Angeles, where rioting
after the Rodney King verdict in 1992 virtually halted Japanese
tourism for months.
</P>
<P>
   But the principal attraction of Las Vegas, according to Japanese
and Las Vegas tourist officials, is cost. The city's average room
rate, $73, is less than half that at comparable hotels in Hawaii,
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Entertainment, food and golf in Las
Vegas are all inexpensive by American standards, and dirt-cheap
compared with those of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   These disparities have not gone unnoticed by young single
Japanese working women, who often travel in pairs or groups _
though often on smaller budgets these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yuka Saito, 25, a cosmetics saleswoman from Chiba, Japan, and
her hometown travel partner, Megumu Uchida, a 26-year-old
architect, wasted little time recently visiting the Fashion Outlet
of Las Vegas, where they stocked up on tennis shoes, clothing,
sportswear and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, they said through a translator, they would
be off to see the Radio City Rockettes at the Flamingo Hilton, and
planned to ride the roller coaster at the New York-New York Hotel
and pack in as many other activities as they could in their
weeklong first visit to the United States. The women were staying
in a midpriced hotel far from the luxury hotels on the Strip that
Japanese tourists favored when times were good.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain prices also help explain why several thousand Japanese
couples a year marry or renew their vows in Las Vegas. ``For less
than half the cost of a traditional wedding in Japan,'' the Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority says, ``the entire wedding
party can travel abroad for this important family ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, about 40 Japanese family members and friends
attended a wedding in the city's Candlelight Wedding Chapel, which
performs as many as 1,000 Japanese weddings and renewal of vows a
year.
</P>
<P>
   An average $500 ceremony includes flowers, photographs, a
videotape, a two-tier wedding cake and an organist playing ``Here
Comes the Bride.'' ``They don't want Japanese music, and I've never
seen a bride in a kimono,'' said Brandon Reed, general manager of
the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese newlyweds, of course, come to honeymoon rather
than tie the knot. Aota and Mayumi Mokoto married in Amori
prefecture before flying to Las Vegas on their first visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very much touched by what we saw,'' Mokoto said
through the interpreter for Eagle Scenic Airlines, which had just
flown the couple on a four-hour sightseeing tour to the Grand
Canyon. Some 250,000 Japanese tourists fly from Las Vegas to the
canyon each year on tours that range from a few hours to overnight
and cost $200 to $400 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese visitors also ride charter buses from Las Vegas to
see the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon and Monument Valley in the
nearby deserts of Arizona and Utah. ``A third of our business is
Japanese, and this year business is even better than last year,''
said Michelle Michalewicz, general manager of Western Leisure, a
tour company based in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, meanwhile, is biding its time. ``In the long term,
L.A. will play an even bigger role role in Japanese vacation
plans,'' said Bob Moore, an executive with the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau, ``because here we have a mix of
theme parks, sports, food, culture and so much else that Japanese
tourists like.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tello of the Japan Travel Bureau in Las Vegas says
he has no doubt that Japanese tourists will return to Los Angeles
in big numbers: ``That's because we'll soon be selling package
tours to Los Angeles from here.''

RUSSIAN OIL: SO MUCH, YET SO LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)  
 (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hidden beneath the vast Russian land mass and the Arctic waters
around it could lie more oil than enriches the Middle East, many
experts believe. Yet despite decades of effort, the Russian oil
industry has tapped only a fraction of it.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time, that seemed about to change. The fall of the
Soviet Union brought a flood of Western oil executives, offering to
spend tens of billions of dollars and provide much-needed
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements were signed, wells were drilled, expertise and
technology began to arrive and, most important, capital _ lots of
it _ was on the verge of being spent.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the latest Russian crisis, the winds began to
shift. Political turmoil, combined with a growing concern that
Russia would lose control of a vast natural resource, stalled the
legislation and the changes demanded by Western companies before
they would loosen the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   So, again, the world's oil executives must wait out a crisis.
They could give up, of course, but most are convinced that they
cannot afford to _ the potential is too great.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be a long wait, because there is a growing
suspicion in the industry that nothing can be accomplished in
Russia until a new generation comes to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is very reluctant to allow others to exploit their
natural resources,'' said John J. O'Connor, a senior vice president
at Texaco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worry that unless investment begins to flow soon,
Russian oil exports could slip. That could make it even harder for
Russia to come out of its economic crisis and provide the money
that Russian oil companies need to keep up production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in a wait-and-see mode and will not give the
cash,'' said John Hervey, an oil analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``If the major oil companies don't invest, then Russia
won't be able to maintain its infrastructure even at its currently
poor level.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Russia has managed to keep some dollars flowing.
``Even when their domestic consumption went down, they have been
able to maintain their exports in the last few years,'' said John
Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation,
a research group based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Russian exports averaged 2.51 million barrels a day,
and for the first half of this year they were up slightly. But
because of lower prices for crude oil on the world market, revenue
plunged to about $5.6 billion in the first half of the year from
$7.3 billion in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian oil companies, meanwhile, are facing new obstacles as
their country stumbles. Russian Customs officials have begun
demanding prepayment of various charges, according to Georgi
Bedineishvili, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Russian oil companies need capital desperately,
it is drying up. Until recently, Western oil companies, often
stymied in getting their own projects off the ground in Russia,
invested in native companies as the only way to get into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield bought an 8 percent stake in Lukoil, Russia's
largest private oil concern, a couple of years ago for $344
million, and formed a joint venture that was planning to invest
about $5 billion in Russia and neighboring countries. And British
Petroleum bought a 10 percent stake in Sidanko in the spring for
about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness to invest, however, evaporated by June. The
attempt to sell a 75 percent stake in Rosneft, the last big energy
company on the government's privatization list, did not attract any
buyers, even when the price fell from $1.6 billion to $470 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another blow was a decision earlier this month by Elf Aquitaine,
the French oil company, to abandon an effort to buy a stake in
Sibneft for about $570 million because of worries about lower oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government has been going after the oil
companies for huge amounts of taxes that they owe, adding to the
pressure to obtain capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banks, which came into big stakes in most of the oil
companies when the companies defaulted on loans _ are largely
unable to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bedineishvili said the fate of the industry now rests largely on
how the new Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, and the Parliament
respond to the country's overall financial crisis. ``You cannot
isolate the oil companies from what will happen in the country in
general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most Russian oil companies are trying to muddle
through.
</P>
<P>
   Rosneft _ in partnership with Exxon and Sodeco, a Japanese oil
company _ has spent close to $400 million exploring an oilfield off
Sakhalin Island in eastern Siberia, an area believed to contain
about 2.9 billion barrels of oil. But the Russian company had
trouble paying its share of the exploration costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Bogdanchikov, Rosneft's new president, said in a recent
interview in the Russian newspaper Kommersant Daily that his
company, unable to collect much of what it was owed from customers,
was in a critical situation. The sale of Rosneft was not feasible
now, he said, adding, ``To my mind, we shall need one and a half to
two years to bring the company into the shape where it will be
worth $2 billion to $3 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have decided to divest. Yukos, Russia's second-largest
private oil producer, is trying to rid itself of 53 oilfields and
about 3,000 workers by transferring them to new companies partly
owned by local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western executives are hopeful that the Kremlin can
eventually work its way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new government offers pragmatic partnership potential,''
said O'Connor of Texaco, which is seeking to develop the Timon
Pechora Basin in northern Siberia. It has also teamed up with Mobil
Oil to develop some of the reserves in the Kirinsky field off
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make multibillion-dollar decisions, you have to have
the confidence that the system is predictable and stable,'' he
said. ``All these things are absent.''

<P>
   CHICO, Calif. _ As political rallies go, it wasn't much: a knot
of about 20 people standing in front of a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric
Co. office in this small city about 90 miles north of Sacramento.
Passers-by ignored the signs they waved, placards that supported a
proposition on the California ballot on Nov. 3 intended to upend
deregulation of the state's utilities and sharply cut electric
rates for residential and small-commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   But television crews from two local stations recorded the event,
and the activists who organized it welcomed the free publicity for
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reduced to stunts,'' acknowledged Harry Snyder, a senior
advocate for Consumers Union, the nonprofit group that publishes
Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   With little money for television commercials and an issue that
confuses many voters, Consumers Union and other groups are trying
to ignite a rate-payer revolt to pass Proposition 9 and rein in the
state's utilities, which the groups say are failing to share enough
of the benefits of deregulation with smaller customers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a long-shot effort, but one that the utilities and their
allies are taking very seriously. Opponents of Proposition 9 are
spending more than $30 million on a campaign to defend the
deregulation plan that went into effect earlier this year. Although
the utilities' barrage of television commercials has cut into
support for the proposition, polls still show it with considerable
support among a befuddled electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Opponents of Proposition 9 say that if it
ever took effect, it could cost utilities about $6 billion and put
the state's credit at risk. More important, a victory for the
measure _ even if it is tied up in the courts, as so many
California ballot propositions are _ could help stall plans to
deregulate utilities in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects would be devastating,'' said Scott Gebhardt,
president and chief executive of PG&AMP;E Energy Services, a subsidiary
of PG&AMP;E Corp., the holding company for Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, the
largest utility in the state. ``It would have a chilling effect
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Proposition 9 certainly hope so. The California
battle comes as the early enthusiasm for deregulation is running
into opposition in a few states.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will vote next month on a ballot initiative that,
like Proposition 9, challenges the mechanism by which utilities can
recover the costs of nuclear plants they built and high-priced
power contracts they signed in the days of strict state regulation.
In New Hampshire, deregulation is stalled in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   California, which has moved further than other states to
deregulate its utilities, has become the flashpoint for consumer
discontent. Since residential power service was opened to
competition earlier this year, the electric bills received by
California households have shown a state-mandated 10 percent
discount. But the bills now also include a variety of additional
charges _ including one for those nuclear plants and high-cost
contracts _ and consumer groups are arguing that smaller customers
are actually saving very little, perhaps only 1 percent to 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us a rate cut, but then the utilities are using fees
to get that back,'' said George West, a retired savings-and-loan
executive who, along with his wife Jan, was one of the handful of
people who showed up for the rally in Chico. ``Something's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, big industrial customers may end up cutting their
power costs by a third within four years, according to energy
marketers. The expected competition among electricity suppliers is
taking place mostly for these big customers; as a result, it is
utilities and industry that are providing most of the money for the
campaign to defeat Proposition 9.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a compromise reached two years ago by the state's
three big utilities, environmental groups and others that enabled
the Legislature to unanimously pass a law making California the
first state to deregulate its utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the utilities agreed to open themselves to
competition from power suppliers outside California; electricity
customers, meanwhile, would foot most of the bill for what are
called stranded costs.
</P>
<P>
   These include the costs California utilities incurred building
nuclear plants that were much more expensive than anticipated. They
also include the costs of long-term contracts for high-priced
electricity from outside suppliers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In California, these stranded costs total a staggering $28
billion according to an estimate two years ago, which is to be paid
off in about four years. Then, smaller customers are also to see
larger savings, of 20 percent or more, as more marketers begin
competing to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   The Utility Reform Network, an activist group that has long
battled the state's utilities on rate matters, took part in the
talks over the 1996 deregulation plan and ultimately adopted a
neutral stance, easing the deal's passage in Sacramento. But now,
the group, known by the acronym Turn, has joined Consumers Union
and others, including the League of Women Voters and the Sierra
Club, to promote Proposition 9.
</P>
<P>
   The groups, which have raised just $1.2 million to back the
initiative, contend that Proposition 9, if passed, would quickly
cut residential electric bills by 20 percent, basically by shifting
$6 billion in stranded costs to the utilities and their
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   It would also prevent the utilities from imposing fees on rate
payers to pay off a separate $6 billion bond issue that enabled the
power companies to give the rate payers a 10 percent rate cut this
year. In effect, the initiative's backers say, it would stop the
utilities from taking back with one hand the discount they extended
with the other.
</P>
<P>
   But if Proposition 9 is approved by the voters, the utilities
say that bondholders would be left in limbo, endangering the credit
rating of every public borrower in California. They are also
threatening to go to court to uphold their right to be reimbursed
for costs they incurred when rates were regulated. If that happens,
the implementation of the proposition _ and possibly of utility
deregulation here over all _ could be tied up for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have to fight it all over again,'' said Robert Glynn,
who is chairman, president and chief executive of PG&AMP;E, which is
based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That prospect could inhibit other states from proceeding with
their own deregulation plans. ``People will be more inclined to
wait and see,'' said Robert Johnson, executive director of the
Electric Consumers Alliance, which represents about 260 consumer
groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The other states that have adopted deregulation plans are
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Maine, Illinois and Montana; 15 others are putting plans together.
</P>
<P>
   Here in California, the three major electric utilities _ Pacific
Gas and Electric; Southern California Edison, which is owned by
Edison International, and San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric Co., owned by
Sempra Energy Corp. _ have spent heavily to saturate the state with
prime-time commercials opposing Proposition 9.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities have wide and formidable support, not only from
such expected allies as associations for large industrial customers
and local chambers of commerce, but also from labor unions, which
worry about job losses because of high power rates; environmental
groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resource
Defense Council, which favor the deregulation plan's incentives for
using renewable energy and encouraging efficiency, and education
groups like the California School Boards Association, which do not
want to see borrowing costs rise.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide polling on the initiative indicates that prospective
voters are confused and divided. Three respected polls put support
for Proposition 9 at anywhere from 43 percent of those questioned
to just 19 percent; the undecideds range from 23 percent to 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to sway the result, both sides are making
simplistic appeals to voters' pocketbooks and their sense of fair
play.
</P>
<P>
   In one anti-Proposition 9 TV spot, former state Treasurer Thomas
Hayes warns that after conducting an in-depth study he concluded
that passage of the proposal would cause a default on the
deregulation bonds, ``leaving California taxpayers liable for about
$6 billion.'' Such a default, he warns, would force California
municipalities and schools to pay higher interest rates when they
borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   The other side relies on news interviews with spokesmen, like
Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer activist who in 1988 spearheaded
Proposition 103, an initiative that led to rebate checks for many
of the state's auto insurance customers.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed this month by San Francisco television station KRON,
Rosenfield assailed the utilities for persuading politicians to
require rate payers to ``pay 100 percent of the utilities' bad
debts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This outrageous corporate welfare will cost every family in
California $2,000,'' he said. An hour later, at another station, he
struck out again, comparing the full recovery of stranded costs to
the ``utility mafia calling in all their chits.''
</P>
<P>
   But this lively debate has not made either utility deregulation
or Proposition 9 much clearer to many people, who say in interviews
that they remain unsure how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Salah Atshon, a clerk at a small delicatessen near
Union Square in San Francisco, has seen many of the ads. ``They
tell me to say `no,''' he said, standing behind the counter, ``but
they tell me little about what exactly the proposition says.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Davis, who owns a film processing business in Chico and
follows utility deregulation for the Chico Chamber of Commerce,
said he was unsure what Proposition 9 would do. ``And I've read it
twice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is reluctant to tamper with the existing
deregulation plan, especially because it has only begun to take
hold. Indeed, the Chico chamber decided to oppose the proposition
rather than disrupt deregulation at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most small-business people want to take a wait-and-see
approach and let things evolve,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The utility business was deregulated in California in March,
after a three-month delay. That wait was because of glitches in the
software used to run a power pool in which electricity could be
bought and sold by competing marketers, utilities and independent
power producers, much as on a commodity exchange.
</P>
<P>
   An $89 million statewide publicity campaign had raised
expectations that customers would be able to choose a supplier
other than their established local utility and that the competition
would help drive down rates.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller customers, however _ whether homeowners, renters or
small-business owners _ found that there were few choices. Since
the smaller customers were already guaranteed a 10 percent
discount, most power suppliers could offer little in the way of
savings and still cover their expenses, let alone eke out a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Corp., for example, tried offering two weeks' worth of
free electricity to entice smaller customers. But after spending
millions of dollars and months of effort, Enron, based in Houston,
attracted only 30,000 customers. So it withdrew from the consumer
market in April.
</P>
<P>
   All together, only about 100,000 customers out of a potential 10
million statewide have switched away from their utilities.
Municipal systems, like the one that serves most of the city of Los
Angeles, are exempt from the deregulation law unless they choose to
compete outside their service area.
</P>
<P>
   But utilities and outside power suppliers like Enron are
competing vigorously for large industrial customers, the market
that, with its economies of scale, offers the greatest potential
for profits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, PG&AMP;E Energy Services is spending about $100 million
pursuing manufacturers and other big businesses. Among other
things, the company is providing staff to help customers find ways
to conserve energy, change processes and shift power use to
off-peak times, when it is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps, together with a decline in industrial electric rates
because of the increased competition, are expected to save some
large customers hundreds of millions of dollars, cutting their
power costs by a third or more over about four years, according to
Gebhardt of PG&AMP;E Services.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like these, the initiative's backers say, show that the
fruits of deregulation are not being shared equitably. Moreover, in
June, when various deregulation-related charges were broken out on
bills for the first time, some smaller customers began to realize
that even their 10 percent discount did not come without strings.
</P>
<P>
   They saw, for instance, a charge labeled ``Trust Transfer
Amount,'' which is being collected to pay off the $6 billion of
bonds that were sold on behalf of the utilities by agents to help
make the 10 percent rate cut possible. On many residential bills,
the charge is actually larger than the discount.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers look at the two amounts and wonder where the
savings are, even though the two figures are not comparable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The mathematics of California rate payers' bills underscore a
big reason that most states have been slow to deregulate utilities:
it is difficult to keep electricity rates from going up in the
early years because the utilities' stranded costs must be paid.
Otherwise, the long-established power companies are stuck with
plants that cannot compete once the shield of monopoly is lifted
and cheap power begins to flow freely.
</P>
<P>
   In California, that challenge was made a bit less formidable by
the fact that many of the utilities' contracts for higher-priced
power from independent suppliers were about to run out; that meant
the price that the utilities were paying for power would drop
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such savings would have been passed on to customers by
the California Public Utilities Commission in rate reductions
estimated at 8 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the negotiators who cobbled together California's
deregulation plan in 200 hours of marathon meetings agreed to allow
the utilities to freeze rates. On the surface, that looked like a
good deal for consumers used to regular increases in power costs.
In reality, it was a huge source of revenue for the utilities to
apply toward paying off their stranded costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very creative and pragmatic way to get to
competition,'' said Gebhardt, who had gone through the slow process
of deregulation of the natural gas industry when he was an Enron
executive. ``You keep the utilities whole while you open up
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the 10 percent discount was insisted upon by legislators
and advertised as a further inducement for popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates like Snyder of Consumers Union see the
compromise differently, complaining that no strong voice for rate
payers was represented in the negotiations. ``The person paying the
bill was left out of the room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides forcing the utilities to pay about $6 billion of
stranded costs _ those for building and operating nuclear plants _
Proposition 9 would also eliminate the Trust Transfer Amount from
customers' bills, by prohibiting utilities from charging rate
payers for the costs of retiring the $6 billion in bonds sold to
finance the 10 percent rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree, though, that any cost-shifting to the
utilities will be borne by their investors and that the companies'
stock prices are likely to fall.``The shareholders will have to
pay,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Californians reached this point in part because Turn, the
rate-payer activist group, blinked during negotiations over the
1996 deregulation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Turn's executive director Nettie Hoge said in an interview that
she had misgivings about the agreement from the start but believed
it was the best deal that could be reached. Businesses tired of
paying some of the highest rates in the country were threatening to
move plants to other states with cheaper power, and there was a
sense that the state needed to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While Turn lobbied to protect consumers during the negotiations,
she said, ``I did not have the courage to say, `This doesn't meet
our bottom line.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the group has been actively seeking to change
California's program. ``I don't think this is the best thing for
residential customers,'' Ms. Hoge said. ``I think the utilities got
a windfall.''

an odd-shaped kind of business. With performers who are mostly
African American, rap sells more records to white customers than
black, and more than 85 percent of all the purchasers are male. Why
so popular with young white men? ``To aggravate their daddies,''
said James. In other words, if heavy metal fails, rap will surely
get the job done. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Oh, Martha! You make it look so easy
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angela Sarris of Marietta, Georgia displays an infant-size bunny
costume she made a couple of years ago from a Martha Stewart
pattern _ its preciousness prompting a chorus of oohs and aahs from
nearly two dozen admirers.
</P>
<P>
   They've come to Borders Books in Buckhead, as many do on the
first Thursday evening of each month, to trade cookies, crafts and,
most importantly, advice on how to achieve the blissful domestic
perfection Stewart epitomizes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfection they've found not so easy to achieve _
especially if they rely only on Stewart's example.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sarris, 36, had one bit of advice for anyone
wanting to make the bunny costume: ``If you want to actually get
the kid in the costume, you'll need to put a much longer zipper in
it than Martha called for.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the corrections and quirks, if not outright disasters,
mount as members show and tell their ``Martha'' projects each
month: the coffee ice cream too hard to scoop; the cookie recipe
that ran off the pan; the soap that burned in the microwave; or the
one ingredient, like lime extract, that simply can't be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be the theme of the group _ what we did wrong,''
said Katherine Weske, community relations assistant at Borders and
leader of the Martha ``Good Things'' group. ``It seems whenever you
try a Martha project, there's always one disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The group began as a one-time promotional event coordinated
among Borders bookstores nationally, said Weske. It was so
successful at an Atlanta store, the staff decided to add it to the
roster of monthly book club meetings. The first meeting in May drew
about a half-dozen Martha faithfuls, but the crowd has grown, with
nearly two dozen at October's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Those who come are almost always women (there was one man in
three months). Some are stay-at-home moms; others like Victoria
Romero, 29, are single professionals interested in entertaining and
decorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone makes so much fun of Martha, I thought I might be the
only one to show up,'' Romero said of the first meeting she
attended, back in May. ``But I truly appreciate her work.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings usually begin with show and tell by Weske, who
brings in a sample of a Stewart recipe and a demonstration of a
craft. Then other members share their projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about double the size of our other book clubs and I think
it's because it involves actually doing something,'' said Weske.
``It apparently fills a niche for finding out what works and what
doesn't work when it comes to home projects.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what draws Andrea Clay to the meetings. ``I like
to hear how others have already fixed things so I don't have to
make the same mistake,'' said the 31-year-old mother of two who
watches Stewart's show every day and subscribes to the magazine.
``And I thought it would be fun to meet other addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   And addicts they are. Many watch or tape the Martha Stewart show
every day; almost all said they subscribe to Martha Stewart Living
magazine and they've been buying her books for years. At meetings
they gab about the latest on the website (www.marthastewart.com)
and a Martha Stewart book is always given as a door prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first words out of my son's mouth was Martha
because we watch her show so much,'' said Sarris, who tapes the
show when she can't be home to see it. ``And yes, I've been teased
by my friends and family for years. They used to make real bad
jokes about her.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Sarris persisted, attitudes began to change. Now her
family often asks if they are going to have a ``Martha'' recipe for
dinner. And she credits Stewart for encouraging families to sit
down and eat together, go on picnics or do home projects in a time
when ``everyone is so quick to just run to a fast food restaurant
and sit in front of the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said she experiences ``just enough success and have just
enough fun with Martha projects to keep me hooked.'' Recently, Clay
tried a molasses cookie recipe that worked beautifully, as well as
a tomato sauce recipe. She's made both several times now, and
brought the cookies to the October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clay said she enjoys visiting with other folks who appreciate
Stewart's penchant for perfection, but don't expect it when they do
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are fair, realistic and honest when it comes to
Martha, just as in any other book club,'' said Clay. ``But we are
willing to take the good and the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clay has found some help. For two months, she had searched
for lime extract to try a recipe for lime bars from Stewart's
magazine. Sarris finally found some _ in Seattle, while she was on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I finally got to make the beloved lime bars,'' Clay said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   How'd they turn out? ``Well the pastry didn't work too
well...maybe it was too humid.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, General Motors has turned out a lot of memorable
big cars, but this colossal company has had trouble thinking small.
Remember the Corvair, the Vega, the Chevette? The Nova derivatives
like the Buick Apollo, the X-body compacts of the late 1970s?
Surely you haven't forgotten the Pontiac Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   In '92, the last time GM made waves in the compact end of the
midsize market, it turned out three of the decade's most
forgettable cars: the banal Olds Achieva (Autoweek called it the
``under-Achieva''); a Buick Skylark that looked like a Wurlitzer
jukebox on wheels, and another incarnation of the Pontiac Grand Am.
Ubiquitous in rental fleets, these were cars you hoped the Avis
agent would assign to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am seemed the best of the three, to damn it with faint
praise. And it was popular, with more than 210,000 sold in each of
the last six years. Of course, with a huge dealer network and
generous incentives, GM can move a lot of sheet metal no matter
what it is wrapped around.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the all-new '99 Grand Am and Olds Alero _ Buick will
no longer impose small cars on the public _ GM has again vowed to
be competitive in this hard-to-define market segment (think of them
as jumbo compacts or junior midsize sedans). The Grand Am fits
neatly between the compact Sunfire and the Grand Prix, at the large
end of the midsize range.
</P>
<P>
   Test drives in three Grand Ams _ an SE2 V6 sedan and a GT coupe,
both from GM's press fleet, plus a nearly new four-cylinder SE1
that I rented at the Kansas City airport _ provided evidence that
GM has actually begun to listen to the average customers who buy
average cars like these.
</P>
<P>
   The previous Grand Am, like some other GM cars of the past, made
me think I was being tested: Let's see if he notices that the
steering is numb, the brakes are grabby, the seats are
inhospitable, the plastic looks cheap, the switches feel temporary.
</P>
<P>
   (And don't forget those halcyon days a decade ago, when the rub
strips came unglued from half the GM cars on the road, dangling
from bumpers like loose wrappings from The Mummy.)
</P>
<P>
   A few days in pampered test cars cannot measure durability, but
Pontiac has exorcised the worst devils of the old Grand Am. The new
car's body structure is admirably rigid, and that pays many
dividends: the handling is better; the ride is well-controlled; the
cabin is surprisingly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the car has a feeling of solidity that was missing
before. The doors close with a Japanese ``thunk'' instead of a
Detroit ``ka-ping.'' Though the car is slightly shorter, the cabin
is roomier because the wheelbase was stretched nearly 4 inches and
the wheels were pushed out, wide-track style.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Pontiac's sporty image, the Grand Am is
self-consciously flashy, with thick plastic armor along the side,
big triangular headlamp housings, dual exhaust tips and, often, a
spoiler perched on the rear deck. The standard 15-inch wheels are
bigger than most rivals', and serious 16-inch aluminum wheels are
available.
</P>
<P>
   This look-at-me styling is not for everyone, but GM figures that
the meek will inherit the Grand Am's conservative second cousin,
the Chevy Malibu, while the import-oriented will lean toward the
Alero.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is going after the exhibitionists. Jace Stokes, the
assistant brand manager for product development, said many buyers
``consider the car an extension of their wardrobe _ they like to be
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   They are younger, too, and that is a good thing. Well-toned
bodies _ 60 percent to 70 percent of buyers are women, many of them
in their 30s _ will find the seats less punishing than people with
creaky middle-age frames.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a line of uncomfortable seats in small GM cars,
the SE2's fancy ``up level'' buckets had an adjustable lumbar
control that seemed to have two settings: no support at all, or the
feeling of a steel rod pressing against one's back. And the fabric
had a distinctly synthetic texture _ is Pontiac getting this stuff
from Plymouth?
</P>
<P>
   Even the instrument panel embellishes on the Grand Am's
golly-gee design. The gauges are housed in two round binnacles, and
they light up like a pinball machine when the car is started, the
needles zipping around the dials and back. Every button, knob or
label is lighted, glowing orange at night.
</P>
<P>
   The air vents are big, round and prominent. The ignition switch
is on the dash, and buttons for the stereo and cruise control are
on the steering wheel hub. All the bits and pieces in the interior
felt durable, save for the release button of the shifter, which
wobbled loosely in its socket.

 UNDATED: its socket.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there were other examples of shoddy quality control, perhaps
an outgrowth of GM's labor turmoil last summer: On all three cars,
gaps between body panels were uneven. The rented sedan had paint
runs and rubber seals protruding from the top of the doors. The GT
coupe's numerous glitches included poor paint, uneven gaps around
the deck lid and a badly aligned waterproofing seal in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Two engines are offered: a twin-cam, 16-valve four cylinder (150
horsepower) and a pushrod 3.4-liter V6 (170 horses) that replaces a
3.1-liter unit. The four was just adequate, laboring when the
air-conditioner was running. The old-fashioned V6 was noisy but
spirited, making 0-to-60 runs in about 7.7 seconds. Its 195
foot-pounds of torque dusts prime competitors like the Dodge
Stratus, Ford Contour and Nissan Altima (which has no V6).
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is only a four-speed automatic transmission,
though a five-speed manual will be available on four-cylinder
models next year.
</P>
<P>
   My chief complaint with the Grand Am, particularly with the V6,
was its unruly manners on hard acceleration, as the rush of torque
tugged the front, driving wheels to the side. And while the
steering tracked nicely, it was too light for my taste, with a
loosey-goosey feel at low speeds. A large-diameter steering wheel,
chosen for its appearance, also diminishes the road feel.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am's brakes are much improved, and Pontiac says stops
are 14 percent shorter. Still, while the Alero has four-wheel
disks, the Grand Am SE has a front-disk, rear-drum layout that
saves Pontiac perhaps $50 per car.
</P>
<P>
   While few of the cheaper models from competitors come with
anti-lock brakes, all Grand Ams have that feature _ an essential
one, in my view. Another nice standard feature is an electronic
traction control that cuts power to any wheel that starts to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Like many GM models, the Grand Am lacks engine braking. Take
your foot off the gas pedal and the car keeps moving with little or
no decrease in speed, as one has come to expect in a lifetime of
driving. This lack of rolling resistance improves fuel economy but
results in more wear on the brakes and a feeling that the car isn't
responding to the signals you're sending it.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday driving _ the mundane stop-and-go that Grand Ams
will generally be used for, despite the racy images in TV
commercials _ the small Pontiacs performed competently. Still, one
gets a sense that cornering ability was sacrificed on the altar of
a smooth ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am does not offer side air bags, and it does not have
a shoulder belt in the center of the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Ams run from $16,395 to $22,000. Even the plainest models
come with features that are optional or unavailable elsewhere, like
foglamps, backup lights that illuminate the side of the car, a
monitor of the engine oil's cleanliness and interior lights that
slowly fade out. Air-conditioning, a tachometer and a tilt wheel
are standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Am, like the Malibu, offers a lot for the money.
Unlike the Malibu, it has some attitude. More Quicksilver than J.
Crew, it may not appeal to the buttoned-down crowd, but without the
need to be all things to all people, Pontiac let a little
personality shine through. &QL;

 &HT;    COLUMN: Wind and water necessary elements of garden harmony
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a static place is a garden without wind. That was sadly
clear during summer, when camel-breath air stood still on long hot
days. Then, I understood better than ever why feng shui, the
ancient Chinese art of placement, translates literally as wind and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Both are necessary to bring harmony to the garden, just as
placing objects in certain ways can put us in harmony with our
surroundings _ the essence of feng shui (pronounced fung shway).
</P>
<P>
   The contributions of water are obvious, as it is visible and so
necessary for growth. Wind's invisibility makes it less a part of
our consciousness. Its presence and effect, however, assert
themselves mightily.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of my earliest recollections of wind in the
garden centers on a quite undesirable plant. As a young boy, I was
always entertained, enchanted, when gusts on dandelions created
seed showers. Even today, I must confess, I don't dislike the
dandelion as much as I'm supposed to when the breezes pick up and
take those seeds away, taking me back to the garden of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Another picture of wind sticks in my mind, too. Looking out the
window of a bus I was riding near Jerusalem back in 1978, I was
mesmerized by breezes that turned tree leaves upside down, showing
their silvery underneaths instead of their green tops. I still
don't know the name of those trees, but I can still see them. And
the breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Wind mercifully came to my garden again the other day, after
what seemed like such a long time. How welcome, how sweet.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about an autumn breeze. Maybe it's that the
air is fresher, cooler, the skies clearer. For sure, the new breeze
wafting through my office window was enhanced greatly by what it
was carrying: the scent of tea olive, newly blooming by the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, I got a whiff of jasmine through the back
window, a special gift from the wind, as that plant was sentenced
this spring to the compost heap. I must make it comeback plant of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, the sights that wind brings to the garden. My butterfly
weed puts flocks and flocks of silken-haired seeds in the air,
dispatching them to faraway places. Sitting on the back porch, I
see them fly by, several stories high.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the ground, the wind rings bamboo chimes and rustles
bamboo leaves, creating incomparable sound pictures that include
forests and pandas and gorillas galore. The ginkgo leaves, trying
to go golden, the Japanese maples, heading toward burgundy and
banana, dance in autumn's breeze. Even my little pond responds, its
water rippling enough to entertain the goldfish. In a rushing gust
the other day, the stiff Japanese black pine shook and waved _
along with the top of the saucer magnolia.
</P>
<P>
   Such great movement wind brings to the garden, like a million
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, after this long dry summer, I have seen too many
leaves dropped by the wind before they get their usual autumn
color, riding to earth stiff and brown.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is part of wind's role. It helps remind us that the
garden does not always live and change in ways we want or expect.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly _ through violent storms _ we get periodic reminders
from both wind and water that their delighting beauty sometimes is
overshadowed by their furious destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But between those storms, there is gentleness to see and feel.
Harmony to enjoy.

 &HT;    Furniture makers' eclectic collection adds a new chapter to the
life of legendary writer
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _Jack Hemingway heard the bell toll.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he and his two brothers rejected requests to lend
their father's famous name _ Ernest Hemingway _ to commercial
interests. ``Then others started telling us, `There are people out
there making money off it anyway, why don't you?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So two years ago, the family agreed to become proactive. The
licensing agent the Hemingways had hired to guard its name
approached Thomasville Furniture about the idea of creating a
collection inspired by places where the legendary
author-outdoorsman-
</P>
<P>
   celebrity had lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other manufacturers that have branded their products, the
furniture giant had never needed a big name to strengthen its
merchandise sales but decided to give it a try. ``I've been here
for 50 markets now, and I've never seen the excitement I'm seeing
from our dealers,'' Thomasville vice president Jim Anderson said
upon unveiling the Ernest Hemingway Collection at the fall
International Home Furnishings Market, which ended Thursday in High
Point.
</P>
<P>
   The new line was among several making headlines at the world's
largest wholesale expo. Others paid tribute to London's Victoria &AMP;
Albert Museum (Widdicomb), the Professional Golfers Association
(Keller, Vanguard) and Hollywood costume designer Bob Mackie
(American Drew).
</P>
<P>
   The 96-piece Ernest Hemingway Collection created by Thomasville
and 11 other manufacturers spotlights four locales _ Key West,
Fla., (with West Indies themes), Kenya (African motifs), Havana
(Spanish colonial influences) and Ketchum, Idaho (Southwestern
styles) _ to tap the romance and worldliness of the man who won a
Pulitzer Prize for ``The Old Man and the Sea.'' Like Hemingway, the
line is casual and eclectic, with an emphasis on leather, wicker
and hardwoods in 22 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a look that instantly drew a thumbs up from the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a furniture person. You sit on the stuff, sleep on it,
make love on it,'' said Jack Hemingway, who at 75 sports an uncanny
resemblance to his ``Papa,'' as the author was nicknamed. ``But we
were overwhelmed when we saw this collection.''
</P>
<P>
   His family had seen sketches throughout the process. ``My
brothers and I didn't want things cheap but of a high grade _ the
sort of lifestyle my father led,'' Hemingway said.
</P>
<P>
   But that ``lifestyle'' raised a marketing issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branding'' a product with a famous personality's name can be
risky for manufacturers, and Hemingway, who killed himself in 1961,
led an often scandalous life, racking up four marriages. But Jack
Hemingway and the company believe the author's literary genius will
overshadow any negative vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the pieces are definitely reminiscent of periods in
his life,'' said the father of actress Mariel Hemingway and model
Margaux Hemingway, who two years ago became the fifth family member
to take her life.
</P>
<P>
   For Thomasville, developing the collection proved about as
adventuresome as a Hemingway safari. Market research confirmed that
consumers indeed would associate the author, whose works included
``The Sun Also Rises'' and ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' with
romance and adventure _ not booze and brawls, as he was known.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Walters, Thomasville's vice-president of wood products,
spent hours sifting through the 11,000 photos of the author
archived at Boston's John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. Though few
of the images held furnishings, the big picture Walters left with
was one depicting a lifestyle that, above all, was casual and
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He then traveled to Ketchum, where Hemingway spent his final
years. There, family members recounted memories of the author
confronting lions in Kenya, shooting crows in Cuba and carousing at
Sloppy Joe's bar in Key West. The collection would be, in a word,
eclectic _ a strong selling point for consumers who are embracing
the once-frightening mix 'n' match approach to combining furniture
styles and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the pieces are fashioned after furnishings the author
actually owned, though a safari stool and writer's desk come close,
said Thomasville's Marilou Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant elements in the Kenya group is
twill. The finely woven split cane covers the head and foot boards
of an upholstered bed, giving it an exotic edge.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ketchum line, there's a Papa Hemingway Writing Desk as
high as a sideboard. ``After being injured in his (two 1954) plane
crashes, he wrote standing up,'' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Key West group contains a chair made from woven hyacinth
that folds like a deck chair, while another chair is fashioned
after ones in Sloppy Joe's bar.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Havana category, a black iron canopy bed injects a
Spanish flavor to the line.
</P>
<P>
   Each upholstered piece displays a small brass commemorative
nailhead branded with an ``H.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the collection, including rugs, clocks, wall art, throws
and masks, was launched to take advantage of a market where 70,000
retailers and designers buy furniture for stores and clients, it's
designed to coincide with the centennial of Hemingway's birth next
July.
</P>
<P>
   So what would Papa think of all the hype?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I learned very early in life is to never put words
in his mouth,'' Jack Hemingway said. ``But I think he would think
this is really great.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ernest Hemingway Collection will be available in stores
early next year. For the nearest retailer, call 1-800-225-0265 or
check the manufacturer's Web site at http://www.thomasville.com.

 &HT;    Holy hip-hop! Gospel is suddenly cool
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hip-hop gospel star Kirk Franklin stages a mock trial on his
latest album.
</P>
<P>
   As a news anchor-like voice narrates the case of ``Kirk Franklin
vs. the State of the World,'' a chorus of church folks accuses
Franklin of defiling the church by merging hip-hop and gospel
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen your video and you won't come and do that mess in my
church,'' one member of the chorus rants at Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   The segment is clever but it is wrong. The trial between hip-hop
and gospel music already has been settled. Hip-hop won. It has not
only merged with traditional gospel music but is now considered
responsible for much of the genre's explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop gospel Gospel music today is not only filled with
hip-hop music, much of the genre's success is based trial between
hip-hop and gospel music verses gospel music has already been
settled. Hip-hop music won. Hip-hop music is not only widely
accepted in gospel music circles today; it's seen as crucial to its
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enhanced gospel's popularity,'' said Delbert Watkins, an
Atlanta gospel musician and producer. ``People are buying gospel
who didn't buy gospel before.''
</P>
<P>
   Turned on by the hip-hop sound, a younger audience of gospel
fans is helping revive this genre of music. The industry posted
record sales in 1997, earning an estimated $550 million, routinely
outselling classical and jazz recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of gospel music's top stars today, such as Fred Hammond and
even Dottie Peoples, have adopted hip-hop musical styles to reach a
growing number of youth who no longer regard gospel as old-folks
music.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's not uncommon to hear hip-hop musical signatures _
throbbing bass lines, Master Pcq grunts and rapping _ in gospel
music. The link between hip-hop and gospel music is so popular
today that there's even a ``Holy Hip-Hop'' radio show in Atlanta,
complete with disc jockeys who go by the name of ``Boogie Bless''
and the ``Hip Hop Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gospel is suddenly cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can still wear my baggy pants, my Timberland boots, my
baseball cap backwards and get a good groove and still praise the
Lord,'' said Danny Wilson, the creator of ``Holy Hip-Hop,'' a
hip-hop gospel radio show that airs every Sunday from 7 to 10 a.m.
on 97.5 FM.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sign of hip-hop's growing acceptance is the lineup
at the third annual Gospel Heritage Weekend. The two-day event
kicked off with a concert Friday night that featured hip-hop star
MC Hammer as well as traditional gospel artists such as Peoples and
the Hawkins Family.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Tinsley, host of Atlanta's top-rated gospel show on
WVEE-FM (V-103), promotes traditional and contemporary gospel. But
he echoed the sentiments of many in the gospel industry when
talking about hip-hop gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Jesus is being exalted in the lyrics for our young
folks, that's all right with me,'' Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Peoples, the queen of traditional gospel music, hired a
rapper to perform a duet with her on her next album.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that her traditional fans might find her foray into
rap offensive, Peoples played the song, ``Show a Sign,'' for one of
her fan clubs. ``The old folks were moving just as much as the
younger folks,'' she said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Though gospel hip-hop music sings of God, it still adopts the
pugnacious aura of secular rap. On the ``Holy Hip-Hop,'' the music
is filled with menacing beats and in-your-face rappers who, on one
song, boast not about taking out gang rivals, but being a ``demon
executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't send a wolf into a herd of sheep because they'll
scatter,'' said D. (Demetrius) Hunter, 29, a hip-hop gospel rapper
who was once a secular rapper dubbed ``Sweet Daddy.'' ``I can go
out and reach people that I used to deal with in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening with hip-hop music today has happened before
with church music. When Thomas Dorsey, now known as the father of
gospel music, first combined blues and church music in the 1930s,
he was attacked for creating a sound that one critic described as
``hollering and wild rhythms that degraded the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The outrage passed and gospel music was accepted. So will
hip-hop gospel music, said Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not trying to change gospel,'' he said. ``It's just
taking it to a new level. Like the Bible says, 'Sing a new song.'
This is a new song for our youth.''

 &HT;    The Mormon Church has more than 50,000 volunteers proselytizing
around the globe
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the open door of an Georgia duplex, two young fresh-faced men
in dark pants, white shirts and ties introduce themselves as Elder
Warren and Elder Hansen. The irony of the titles is lost on the
Cambodian man who greets them.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-olds Chris Warren of Roy, Utah, with hair parted
down the middle and an Opie Taylor grin, and Kevin Hansen of
Layton, Utah, taller, darker and more slender, are Mormon
missionaries. Like thousands of other late teens and
twentysomethings in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, they have left their homes in Utah, where they are part of
a majority religion, to spread the faith in an alien land. In their
case, that means the Deep South, the home of Baptists, Methodists
and Presbyterians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat a lot of chicken here,'' says Warren. ``And the people
are really friendly. Even if they don't know you, they treat you
like you live here.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 Mormon volunteers are proselytizing around the
world, paying their own expenses. Of these, three-fourths are young
men, one-fifth are young women, and the rest are older adults. This
large force for evangelism is one reason the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints, the official name of the Mormons, is among
the fastest-growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The church's work has been so effective that membership in
Georgia has increased tenfold since 1960. In the region that
includes the southeastern United States and the Caribbean, there
are now more than 365,000 Mormons. To lead them, in August church
President Gordon B. Hinckley established the church's first North
American presidency office outside Salt Lake City here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   President Monte J. Brough, 59, who was assigned by Hinckley to
head the church's Southeast Presidency, attributes part of the
church's appeal to similarities in Southern tradition and Mormon
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Deep South, there is a traditional quality with regard
to values, with regard to responsible citizenry, with regard to
what (the apostle) Paul called brotherly kindness, maybe we call it
neighborliness,'' said Brough. ``It's a desire to make life better.
... We think that's part of the reason we're growing so fast _ so
many good Christian people find in our church an answer to their
beliefs and a way to contribute to society.''
</P>
<P>
   To do their part sowing the seeds of mission and harvesting
souls, Warren and Hansen rise at 6:30 a.m. daily, study until 9:30
a.m., then leave home to visit, teach or do community service.
Their work may go on all day, but they are expected to ``retire''
at 9:30 p.m., with ``lights out'' at 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   They find both respect and suspicion _ respect for the
clean-living, family-oriented image of the Mormons, whose ``Word of
Wisdom'' cautions against tobacco, alcohol, tea and coffee;
suspicion because of beliefs that the dead can be baptized into the
church by proxy, that earthly marriages can last forever, and that
human beings can become like God.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, Warren and Hansen have started out to take a
videotape to an East Point woman who has called a 1-800 number on
the church's television commercial. Offices in Salt Lake City refer
information about callers to local contacts in the appropriate
city. The woman is not home, so, Hansen explains, they will knock
on at least five doors in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The first person they see is the young Cambodian man, who
explains that his mother does not speak English. He translates
their message to his mother, then gives them her reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to church,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The young elders thank him, then step over seven crushed
Budweiser cans and some chicken bones in the yard as they make
their way back to the street.
</P>
<P>
   Next-door they talk to an older man sitting in his car in front
of a small white house. They chat for a while, finally offering to
come and study with the man from the Book of Mormon. He puts them
off, citing difficulty seeing. Another car drives into the yard and
a man gets out carrying Kentucky Fried Chicken. Warren and Hansen
have lost their audience.
</P>
<P>
   They head across the street to catch a family just arriving
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard of the Book of Mormon?'' Hansen asks a
woman who hangs back to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of it,'' she says, ``but I believe the King James
Version.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian groups have labeled the Latter-day Saints a cult,
saying they are not really Christian. Discussion about the question
drew national attention in June when the Southern Baptist
Convention held its annual meeting in Salt Lake City and Baptists
went door-to-door evangelizing in Mormon country. Last month, the
Rev. Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist Convention,
went on record again with his belief that Mormon doctrine differs
significantly from historic Christian teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the greatest misconception, that we aren't
Christian,'' says Joy Fife, 66, who became a Mormon in Birmingham
at age 8. ``We do believe the Bible. We just have an additional
book which, for us, is a companion to the Bible. It settles the
questions about baptism and what's going to happen to us when we
die. It just makes the Bible plainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``Another Testament of Jesus Christ,'' the Book of
Mormon is regarded as divinely inspired scripture by Latter-day
Saints, who believe it tells eyewitness accounts of the ministry of
Jesus Christ on the American continent after his resurrection.
Latter-day Saints believe they are restoring the ancient priesthood
established by Jesus with his original 12 apostles, but long gone
from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon was
translated from gold-like tablets shown by an angel named Moroni to
church founder Joseph Smith when he was a teenager in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through Joseph Smith, the same organization that Christ set up
with his 12 apostles was restored,'' says Fife.
</P>
<P>
   Fife has watched the church spread over metro Atlanta since she
was a teenager attending church above an East Point fire station.
She believes she was the ``only female Mormon'' at the University
of Georgia when she enrolled there in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' she says. ``People had such strange
ideas of what we believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fife did a year's mission work in Alabama and Florida, then
returned to Atlanta, where she met her husband, a missionary who
had returned from Denmark and was stationed at Fort McPherson. They
married in the church's temple in Salt Lake City on June 17, 1955.
In Mormon tradition, they were ``sealed,'' so that their marriage
would go on after death.
</P>
<P>
   An important principle of the church is that family
relationships can exist forever as they do on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying until death do us part, we are sealed for
eternity,'' Fife says. Each of their three adopted children also
has been sealed to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Fife lives by the church's health code, gives 10 percent of her
family income to the church _ before taxes _ and wears the
``garments,'' special one-piece, modest underclothing representing
the clothing Adam and Eve donned after they succumbed to temptation
in the Garden of Eden. Mormons who have been admitted to the temple
are expected to wear them next to their skin for the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make it obvious that I wear it,'' she said. ``I don't
wear skimpy clothes. I don't believe in exposing your body
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The underclothing, she explains ``is very sacred to us. It
represents covenants and promises we make to the Lord in the
temple. It's also been promised to be a shield and protector to us
as we wear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to live our religion,'' says Fife. ``There are, of
course, people who don't. There are inactive Mormons. There are bad
Mormons. But for having been in the church for so many years, I
think my friends and colleagues in the Mormon Church are the most
wonderful people I could be associated with.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time for dinner on the missionary trail for Warren and
Hansen. They are dining this evening at the home of Robert Brunson,
28; his wife, Bertha, 27; and their sons, Bobby, 3, and Marcus, 1.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment they enter the front door of the family's
apartment in East Point, Hansen and Warren act like brothers to the
parents, favorite uncles to the children.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brunson runs a telemarketing firm. Bertha Brunson _
following the teaching of the Latter-day Saints _ is a stay-at-home
mom.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up Baptist in New Jersey. She was raised by a father in
the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a mother who belonged to
Jehovah's Witnesses. They became Mormon about four years ago after
two young female missionaries knocked on their door in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very open and answered all our questions,'' says
Robert Brunson. ``They asked us to pray and ask God if the church
was for us. We did. They asked us to read some Scripture, and we
did. They asked us to pray and ask God if what they told us was
true. We did, and God revealed to us that it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges some stereotypes of Mormons, even in his own
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `You're going to be a Mormon?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bert's OK with that?'' his dad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't mind if you have another wife?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs now at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some early leaders of the church practiced polygamy during the
19th century, and some maverick Mormons still do _ but in 1890 the
church officially outlawed the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Brunsons were attracted to the church because of ``the
principles of life after death,'' says Bertha Brunson.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons teach that heaven is not a single paradise, but a series
of kingdoms. And the hope of heaven is not lost to those who have
died outside the faith. A unique belief of the Latter-day Saints is
that the dead can be baptized by proxy through the living. The
reasoning is that people may decide after death to be a part of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, being able to think about my ancestors was
very important,'' says Bertha Brunson.
</P>
<P>
   But her children are of equal importance, and within the church
the Brunsons say they have found structure and support for
parenting their boys. Although the Brunsons have lived in metro
Atlanta for only a few months, within the church they found an
instant community. Entertaining the young missionaries is an
acknowledgment of the larger church family.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is smothered chicken. Afterward, Warren and Hansen ask to
be permitted to discuss a ``teaching'' before they leave.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is tithing. They are preaching to the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gives us so much, to not give a little back is robbery,''
Bertha Brunson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to remember God is the source of everything we
have,'' Robert Brunson adds.
</P>
<P>
   Along with lingering questions about polygamy, charges of racism
have been difficult for Latter-day Saints to squelch. Although all
men in the church 18 and older are initiated into a form of
priesthood, until 1978 black men were not ordained.
</P>
<P>
   Former Methodist preacher Roosevelt Whiters, 67, of northwest
Atlanta said a Mormon acquaintance had ``poisoned my mind against
Mormons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me Mormons believe black people should be slaves,''
says Whiters, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the courtesy shown him by two young male
missionaries who stopped by as he was moving into his house from
Miami two years ago, Whiters eventually decided to visit their
church. He is now a Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people need to know the church was racist at one time,
but so were many institutions,'' says Whiters. ``We move on from
here. That was then, this is now.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun goes down, Warren and Hansen meet with Lorenzo
Griffin, who is studying to be baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 49, who supervises security guards on the overnight
shift of a Doraville plant, says he agreed to talk to Hansen and
Warren when they came to his door a few weeks ago because he had
seen the church's impressive television advertising campaign. He
has become friends with the young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show brotherhood and sisterhood outside the church as
well as inside the church,'' says Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight he is studying Lesson Four of a six-lesson preparation
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite discussion,'' Hansen tells him.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 90 minutes, they will go over the distinctive
beliefs of Mormonism: that people existed as spirits before their
physical birth; that those who have died may be converted after
death; that marriages may be sealed eternally; and that the status
of a person in the afterlife will be determined by faithfulness.
</P>
<P>
   For each element of doctrine, the young men point out Scripture
references. (1 Peter 4:6, for example, refers to the Gospel being
proclaimed ``even to the dead.'') Griffin follows them carefully,
interjecting questions and comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're saying gives hope to those who think they have no
hope,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They go on to the church's law of chastity, which forbids not
only fornication and adultery but unclean thoughts and immodest
dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lorenzo, will you live the law of chastity?'' Hansen asks.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who is divorced, pledges to abide by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hansen brings up the final topic for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of health teaches we're not to take alcohol, tobacco,
coffee, tea or harmful drugs into our bodies,'' he says. ``These
bodies we have are gifts from God and he expects us to take care of
them. ... Do you use any of these substances God counsels us
about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I smoke tobacco,'' Griffin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long have you been doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-one years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin pauses to calculate. ``About a pack every 30 hours or
so. And does beer count as alcohol?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Hansen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even have fermented wine, can you?'' Griffin asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Hansen. ``Lorenzo, how do you feel about giving up
alcohol and tobacco?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take me awhile,'' Griffin warns. ``I drink
coffee at work. I have a beer now and then. Tobacco will be
hardest. I'm not going to promise you but I will say I'll do my
best. With God's help, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen offers to refer Griffin to programs endorsed or conducted
by the church to help overcome substance addiction. In their
closing prayer, Warren asks God to ``help Lorenzo give up these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, the church's beliefs and dietary restrictions are
commonplace. In the South, where tobacco is king and almost
everyone drinks Coca-Cola and sweet iced tea, restrictions on
alcohol, tobacco and caffeine are more unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought a lot about that in terms of how to raise my
family, and whether it would be easier to raise them in Utah or
here, away from the West,'' says Mario Hegewald, 40, a father of
four children 7 to 16. ``You find there are challenges in both
areas,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Utah, it's very much sometimes taken for granted. When I
was growing up, in high school I faced a lot of challenges from
friends who, as part of rebelling against their parents, wanted to
go out and experiment with things. Here in Atlanta, away from Utah,
the challenges may be a little bit different, but they're just as
severe. Kids certainly face peer pressure, particularly as they
become teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hegewald, a Salt Lake City native and lifelong Mormon, works for
Georgia-Pacific. In the church, he is responsible for a stake in
Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's good for kids to be challenged directly,'' he
says. ``I've had some of my son's 16-year-old friends come home
with him and ask me these questions _ `Do you really believe this
stuff?' It's almost better for my son to hear me deal with that
than in Utah, where you don't hear those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is after 9 p.m. Hansen and Warren pause before they head home
to thank God for the day and the people they encountered.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, they will be back home, where Warren plans to
attend Weber State University to become an elementary school
teacher and Hansen will study mechanical engineering at Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   They will leave a little of themselves behind in Georgia and
take a little of the South with them back home.

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Late on a moonless night several weeks ago,
two giant oil tankers approached each other near the north end of
the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of one vessel seemed to miscalculate, swinging to
the left where he should have swung right. He soon recognized his
mistake, but tankers do not respond quickly, and as revelers on
nearby pleasure boats watched in horror, the two behemoths drifted
toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the erring captain had acted just in time. The
tankers passed within a few yards of each other, averting a
possible catastrophe. Both sailed on into the night, and the
episode went unreported, known only to crew members and a few
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosporus, 17 miles long and just 700 yards wide at its
narrowest point, has for millenniums been one of the world's most
strategic waterways. As the Black Sea's sole maritime link to the
Mediterranean and the open ocean beyond, it is a vital passageway
not just for trade but for the projection of military might,
political power and cultural influence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as so often over the centuries, the Bosporus is a center
of world attention. Huge amounts of oil have been discovered under
and around the Caspian Sea, and oil companies must decide soon how
to move it toward European markets. The cheapest way might be to
build a short pipeline to the Black Sea coast, and then send the
oil by tanker across the Black Sea, through the Bosporus and into
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   If Caspian oil is exported this way, the number of tankers
passing through the Bosporus could double. Turkish officials say
that is intolerable because the Bosporus passes through the center
of Istanbul, home to 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country has the right to endanger the lives of 10 million
people just because it wants to sell its oil,'' Turkish Environment
Minister Imren Aykut told a crowd at one of several demonstrations
that have been held in Istanbul this year to protest the possible
use of the Bosporus as a transit route for Caspian oil. ``We will
never allow our sea lanes to be turned into oil pipelines.''
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable environmental weight behind this argument.
But Turkey also has a political reason to emphasize the dangers of
shipping oil through the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling out the use of tankers to carry Caspian oil means that a
long pipeline may be necessary. Turks want that pipeline to be
built from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Turkey's
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. So does the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to move Caspian oil out of the Black Sea without
bringing it through the Bosporus. It could be sent by tanker or
undersea pipeline to a port in Bulgaria, Romania or Ukraine, and
from there by barge or pipeline to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials dismiss these plans as
unrealistic. They say that failing to build the 1,080-mile pipeline
from Baku to Ceyhan (pronounced JAY-han) will inevitably mean more
traffic through the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies are set to announce the pipeline route they favor
within a few weeks. They have reportedly concluded that the
Baku-Ceyhan route is too expensive to build now. But Turkish
leaders say they can accept no other route because of the dangers
of increased traffic through the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot turn our straits into a virtual pipeline just
because some oil companies want to make more money,'' Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Few waterways are as fabled as this one. It divides two
continents; only on its shores can one sit in Europe and gaze
across a narrow strait upon the edge of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Jason and his Argonauts are said to have passed through the
Bosporus in pursuit of the legendary golden fleece. The Byzantine
and Ottoman empires were governed from its shores.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred years ago a French historian called it the ``strait
that surpasses all straits, because with one key it opens and
closes two worlds, two seas.'' Later Napoleon said he would abandon
mastery over half his empire rather than surrender it.
</P>
<P>
   As the shipping industry has grown in recent decades, the
Bosporus has filled with ever larger vessels. Today it is not
simply Istanbul's main street, but also a maritime superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   By a quirk of history, however, Turkey has almost no power to
restrict or control traffic through the Bosporus. The Montreaux
Convention of 1936 gives vessels of all nations the right to pass
through unimpeded. They are not even required to take on pilots who
are familiar with the waterway's sharp turns and treacherous
currents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 50,000 vessels, among them supertankers
longer then three football fields, passed through the Bosporus.
Their number is growing by 15 to 20 percent a year. About 1,000
local craft, ranging from vintage ferries to unsteady fishermen's
dinghies, also ply the Bosporus each day. They must always keep an
eye out for the giants.
</P>
<P>
   These giants are hardly the cream of the international tanker
fleet. Some are rustbuckets flying the flags of Russia and Ukraine.
Others of Greek and Maltese registry look equally unseaworthy. In
waterfront neighborhoods, people shudder to see these relics
twisting their way along the rocky channel.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents on the Bosporus are increasingly frequent, some of
them resulting in deaths, oil spills or spectacular fires. In July
the waterway had to be closed after a tanker carrying 87,000 tons
of crude oil ran aground. Another tanker nearly broke apart in
August below the historic Topkapi Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes like these, coupled with the prospect of more tankers
carrying Caspian oil, have left Turkish leaders in a quandary. They
must balance the commitment to free navigation enshrined in the
Montreaux Convention against the safety of a vital waterway that
runs through the heart of a teeming metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has proposed tightening its safety regulations to require
that every ship traversing the Bosporus carry a pilot and be fully
insured. Countries anxious that Caspian oil be exported through the
Black Sea, notably Russia, oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Framers of the Montreaux accord could not have imagined the
danger of chemical, explosive and nuclear cargoes now being carried
through the Bosporus. In 1936 freighters and tankers were far
smaller; the number of them passing through the Bosporus was
one-tenth what it is today, and Istanbul had one-fifteenth its
present population.
</P>
<P>
   But although Turkey warns of ecological and human disaster if
tanker traffic through the Bosporus increases sharply, it is doing
little to promote its case. No official has been named to travel
the world and spread the Bosporus alarm. And although this summer's
mishaps gave the Turkish authorities an ideal chance to highlight
the dangers they foresee, they did nothing to seize it.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials and their American backers deny that they are
overstating the dangers of increased Bosporus traffic in order to
secure approval of their favored pipeline route.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are real issues around the Bosporus,'' a State
Department official said. ``A big accident is almost inevitable
sooner or later, and once it happens, or even before it happens,
insurance costs for tankers will go right through the roof. That's
a big cost the oil companies shouldn't want to pay.''

   MIDEAST-SCENE _ WYE MILLS, Md. _ With a roaring fire to ward off
autumn's chill, a table of veal and fish for sustenance and
stirring words from an ailing monarch, President Clinton led
Israeli and Palestinian leaders through a sleepless quest for
peace, winding up nine days of sequestered summitry with 27
unbroken hours of soul-searching, compromise and hard bargaining.
By sunrise Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had agreed on a dramatic
land-for-security plan that broke a 19-month impasse in the
tortured Mideast peace process. But as aides readied gleaming black
limos and the president's olive green and white helicopter to ferry
the leaders to an official signing ceremony on the White House lawn
70 miles away, the parties hit a pothole on the pathway to peace.
''We have clearly hit a snag and are trying to work our way through
it,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin, his voice cracking
from fatigue, told an equally weary gaggle of reporters. ''I really
don't have any more to give you.'' (Deans, Cox News Service).

&HT;        MCDADE-MURTHA BILL REINS IN PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 -- Tucked inside the nearly 4,000-page
budget deal approved this week is a provision designed to rein in
federal prosecutors, written by veteran Pennsylvania lawmakers with
their own personal gripe toward U.S. attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   It represents a compromise between the lawmakers, Rep. John
Murtha, D-Johnstown, and Joseph McDade, R-Scranton, and the Justice
Department: U.S. prosecutors will be subject to state ethics laws,
but will not have to worry about a citizens review board looking
over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha hailed the compromise for including the ``most
significant part'' of his proposal, subjecting overzealous U.S.
attorneys to the ethics laws of the states in which they are
conducting their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to protect individual citizens from unfair and
coercive legal tactics by aggressive prosecutors who exempt
themselves from the ethics rules in pursuit of a prosecution
victory,'' Murtha said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle is far from over, as Justice lawyers vowed Friday
to continue fighting the McDade-Murtha provisions that were signed
into law Wednesday but will not take effect for six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that some of the provisions were modified,''
said Gregory King, spokesman for the executive office of the U.S.
Attorneys in Washington. But, King added, ``We'll be working in the
next Congress to come up with a legislative solution to (the
remaining rules).''
</P>
<P>
   In its original form, Attorney General Janet Reno advised the
White House to veto the entire spending bill for the Justice
Department if it included the anti-prosecutors provision.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring federal prosecutors to adhere to state
laws, it would have set up an independent citizens review board
that could investigate allegations of prosecutorial abuse by U.S.
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Because of legislative gridlock, Congress was not able to pass
the spending bill for the Justice Department or seven other
spending bills. That inaction set up an intense 10-day negotiation
process this month between congressional leaders and the White
House, leaving almost every detail of the budget up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust cleared, the prosecutor bill was included but it
was stripped of the review board, which Murtha and McDade had
modeled on the new citizens panel that oversees the Internal
Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The two political veterans have each battled U.S. Attorneys in
the past. Murtha was investigated in the 1980 Abscam scandal but
was eventually cleared of all wrongdoing. McDade, however, was
charged with illegally accepting gifts from defense companies under
his committee's jurisdiction, essentially a bribery charge.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Philadelphia cleared McDade, but Murtha has
said that investigation was the impetus for their ``Citizens
Protection Act''. ``Rise up and show the prosecutors that are out
of control -- not all prosecutors, just the ones that are out of
control -- that they need some clear oversight,'' Murtha said in a
fist-pounding speech on the House floor in August.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal prosecutors privately questioned whether Murtha is
forgetting the assistance recently given to him by the U.S.
Attorneys in Johnstown. In July, they secured the conviction of
Donald L. Fenton, 52, for threatening the lives of Murtha and one
of his aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends that its attorneys are already
subject to a rigorous internal review procedure. King, of the U.S.
Attorneys' office, said the hodgepodge rules of each state would
lead to confusion for federal prosecutors handling major cases such
as terrorism or drug dealing that cross state lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``States have different and conflicting rules,'' he said,
adding, ``We'll be using the next six months to educate members of
Congress what the real implications of it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress won't need any persuading. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, Judiciary Committee chairman, and a dozen other
committee members signed off on a letter saying, ``The
(McDade-Murtha) amendment would in practice cede to 50 state bar
associations control of how federal prosecutions are to be
conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   But McDade says there aren't enough controls on the prosecutors,
citing one example of Justice attorneys receiving just a five-day
suspension when they knowingly allowed one of their witnesses to
commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   And Murtha said that only in recent years has the Justice
Department adopted the internal ethics provisions rather than
adhering to state laws. ``The legislation simply codifies in
federal law something that's already supposed to be happening,'' he
said.

MAGAZINE STOCK PICKS OFTEN FAIL TO PAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Resending for possible weekend use) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You see them at nearly every bookstore and corner
newsstand: personal finance magazines touting the best investments
or the hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With the subtlety of a 30-minute infomercial, the magazines
scream to readers the promise of investment success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best Mid-Year Investments,'' declared a SmartMoney article in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Stocks Pegged to Earn 47%'' within the next year, promised
Money magazine in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But how good are these recommendations? Not very, based on a
Daily News review.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper tracked the yearlong performance of 141 stocks
recommended in 21 articles in issues of four popular personal
finance publications. Seventy-three stocks out of the 141 -- or 52
percent -- lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Forget earning 47 percent or even modest returns; more than half
of the stocks recommended in some articles by some of the nation's
most popular personal finance magazines cost their readers money.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned is that readers ought to beware -- even
when the advice comes from some of the best known magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The articles ran in the April 1997 to January 1998 editions and
were selected randomly to gauge the yearlong performance of stocks
through last year's bull market and this summer's bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that not every investment recommendation we make will
work out,'' admitted Bob Safian, managing editor at Money magazine
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he argued that even among professional investors ``if they
have slightly more winners than losers, they are stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazines' record is surprising, considering that most of
the stock picks were made in a market that by almost every measure
was hugely profitable. The findings are a cause for concern because
millions of investors -- through self-directed individual
retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and personal accounts -- have
funneled billions into the stock market in recent years, relying on
personal finance magazines like Money, SmartMoney, Kiplinger's and
Worth for advice.
</P>
<P>
   If those magazines' readers had bought into index funds that
tracked the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index on the first day of that
month's issue instead of buying the magazines' picks, the investors
would have made as much as 45.88 percent (before fund fees and
without reinvesting dividends). If they had bought at the worst
possible day during that time, they still would have made 3.24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the stock recommendations against five indexes (S&AMP;P
500, S&AMP;P Midcap 400, Russell 2000, MicroCap 50 and Wilshire 5000
indexes) that better reflect the market segments of these
securities, the magazines did even worse. Eighty-two out of 141
stocks, or 58 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   For Money magazine, 23 out of 39 stock picks -- or 59 percent --
did not beat their market segment. Seventy-four percent (20 out of
27 stocks) of SmartMoney's picks did not beat the appropriate
indexes. Eleven out of 20 stocks (55 percent) touted by Kiplinger's
lost to comparable indexes. As for Worth, 28 out of 55 stocks, or
51 percent, did not beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   If you took the average return per article, excluding dividends,
and compared the result with a comparable index, 56 percent of
Money magazine's articles did not beat the market. SmartMoney had a
75 percent miss, half of Worth's articles did not beat the indexes
and none of Kiplinger's articles outpaced the market.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's not easy to beat the market. Most mutual fund
managers don't do better than the S&AMP;P 500. Some of the stock picks
in the articles performed well over 12 months but still didn't
outpace the market.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's April 1997 issue recommended buying Chase Manhattan,
which rose 42 percent in a year. But that didn't beat the S&AMP;P 500's
45.88 percent gain over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't much better even if the yardstick is simple
profitability -- whether a stock increased after a year (or, in the
case of the January 1998 special issue, nine months).
</P>
<P>
   Using this yardstick, 18 of 39 individual stocks recommended by
Money from June to August 1997, or 46 percent, lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the performance of all recommendations by article,
three out of nine Money stories showed negative returns -- a 33
percent miss.
</P>
<P>
   However, Money made a good call in an August 1997 article,
``Don't Just Sit There . . . Sell Stock Now.'' Investors who acted
on it would have avoided the October 1997 correction and the
current bear market -- providing they put the money in cash, money
market accounts or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If someone followed the magazine's advice and bought stocks
recommended in other articles in the same issue, the results
would've been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, $1,000 invested in each of five stocks recommended
in ``Defend your portfolio with stocks that promise income and
growth,'' would have made $1,345, or 28 percent, in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But if someone bought $1,000 worth of each stock recommended as
hedges against inflation that also was in the same issue, he would
have lost $1,247 a year later, or 26 percent. Indeed, four out of
the five picks were losers.
</P>
<P>
   As for SmartMoney, 16 out of 27 stocks recommended in the May,
July and October 1997 issues, or 59 percent, lost money. If each of
the four articles examined was tallied separately, half had
declines.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiplinger's April and August 1997 issues, four out of 20
stocks lost money -- a 20 percent miss. One out of four articles
(25 percent) lost money. As for Worth's June 1997, September 1997
and January 1998 issues, 35 out of 55 stocks lost ground (64
percent) and three out of four articles (75 percent) showed losses.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Gilbert, financial editor for SmartMoney in New York,
contends that one year is not enough time to determine a stock's
success. If an investor waits at least five years, ``75 to 80
percent'' of SmartMoney's stock picks will make money, he said.

A MUSEUM WITH MARKET ARTIFACTS AND MUCH PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 25)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Russia defaults on its obligations, the Dow Jones
industrial average swoons, markets around the world bounce around
like yo-yos. Yet this Wall Streeter exudes calm. And why not? He
takes a somewhat longer view.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, John Herzog, the chairman of Herzog Heine Geduld, a
market-maker in over-the-counter stocks, can stare hundreds of
years of financial history in the face just by popping downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the basement of 26 Broadway, the old Standard Oil
building, just a few yards away from Bowling Green in lower
Manhattan, is the Museum of American Financial History, which
Herzog founded in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is celebrating its tenth anniversary this week with a
gala and the public unveiling of a bust of John D. Rockefeller in
the building's lobby at 6 p.m. on Oct. 29, the anniversary of the
1929 stock market crash. The museum, which is to reopen that day
after a three-week refurbishment, will also mark its anniversary
with a major new exhibition, ``Going Public: Own a Share in the
American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The permanent collection boasts artifacts from America's
financial history _ including one of the country's very first
Treasury bonds, endorsed for payment on the back in George
Washington's own hand. There are even bank notes from the
Independent Republic of Vermont dating from the late 18th century,
signed by Ira Allen, brother of Ethan Allen, the Revolutionary War
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bond or document signed by John D. Rockefeller or by
Benjamin Franklin _ to hold that piece of paper can be pretty
exciting,'' Herzog said in a recent interview at his office,
seeking to explain the attraction of a museum of financial history.
``People see not just the piece of paper but the story behind the
piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog's love for financial history is something of a family
passion. Just down the hallway from Herzog's office is R.M. Smythe
&AMP; Com., a dealer in antique securities, which is owned and managed
by his wife, Diana Herzog. It trades in old bonds issued but never
paid by the governments of China and Russia, and even those of
states of the old Confederacy, like Mississippi. These defaulted
bonds, often surprisingly beautiful documents, printed on the
best-quality paper in subtle greens and pinks, are collectors'
items that can change hands for many thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Smythe buys and sells securities like the bonds issued by the
government of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, and by the Kerensky
government in 1916 and 1917 to pay for the flagging Russian
struggle against Germany in World War I. Many of these bonds were
never formally repudiated. Once in a while, they can even regain a
substantial fraction of their face value, if some successor
government decides it wants to make peace with the capital markets
by settling past investors' claims.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's current obligations, for example, which are now in
default, might be a good bet for investors with strong stomachs,
Herzog said. But, he cautioned, ``You have to be willing to lose
100 percent of your investment.''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, of course, investors forget their painful
financial experiences. Discussing the recent Russian financial
debacle, Herzog recalls bankers' enthusiasm for a borrower like
Russia _ apparently willing to pay very high rates of interest _
that had a history of burning its creditors badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might be more surprising is that Russian credits became
somewhat irresistible, he said, recalling how so many sovereign
borrowers defaulted on their bonds earlier this century. ``There
was a willingness to get involved. It's an interesting commentary
on how quickly people forget the hard-earned lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When my father started trading bonds after World War I, they
all carried high rates of interest, and they all defaulted,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   History gives Herzog a lot of comfort at times like the present.
His office is festooned with financial memorabilia, much of it from
past manias, panics and crashes. ``Billions Lost in Wall Street
Debacle,'' screams one newspaper headline from October 1987 that is
framed on his wall.
</P>
<P>
   Such declines, of course, offer great opportunities for the
hardy investor. ``In the perspective of history, we might be
thinking this is a moment to make investments,'' he said, even in
today's Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the way investors sometimes panic _ recently, over
Russian securities, for example _ Herzog said, ``The psychology is
on one side of the balance; the reality is on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia clearly fascinates him, particularly because of its
checkered financial history. ``I can't imagine that Russia would
repudiate,'' he said. ``They even settled some of the czarist debt.
Someone is out there buying this Russian debt. There was a Russian
oil company selling at $1 a share that was selling at $30 a share.
Some of these equities are out there as screaming buys.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Herzog (or his firm) is about to go out and start
spending millions of dollars buying Russian equities. ``I am not a
specialist in all that stuff, although I have some sense of markets
and have tried to develop some historical perspective,'' Herzog
said. And should he feel especially tempted to take a flier, his
museum contains all the reminders he could need of the value of
caution in investing.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, whose main entrance is at 28 Broadway, is open
weekdays, from 11.30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., or, for groups, by
appointment. The museum also has a Web site:

<P>
   Kiplinger's ``preaches long-term investing'' of at least three
to five years, said Manny Schiffres, senior associate editor in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many stories from his and other magazines remind readers about
the long-term nature of their recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not always clear how long an investor has to wait
before the investment produces a competitive return, noted Lou
Richman, financial editor at Yonkers, N.Y.-based Consumer Reports
magazine, which publishes a mutual fund issue once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Finch, executive editor of SmartMoney, believes readers
understand that when his magazine writes about the ``best
investments of 1998, we're certainly hoping they will be the best
performing out there, but we don't have a crystal ball. We're
selling you our best investment ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a story promises ``The Best Midyear Investments for
1998,'' as SmartMoney did, the implication is that readers will get
results in six months, not six years.
</P>
<P>
   Why would magazines whose editors believe in long-term investing
use headlines that promise short-term gratification?
</P>
<P>
   ``The more immediate you make it, with more numbers, the more
attractive it is,'' said Samir Husni, head of the magazine program
at the University of Mississippi at Oxford who publishes a guide to
new consumer magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience wants immediate recommendations: What should I
buy now?''
</P>
<P>
   Readers take 2.5 seconds to decide whether to pick up a
magazine, he said, so publishers must grab attention.
</P>
<P>
   And readers are biting in droves. Money magazine has annual
sales of 1.9 million issues, Kiplinger's has 1.1 million,
SmartMoney commands 700,000 and Worth has 540,000.
</P>
<P>
   Personal finance magazines have flourished. There are at least
20 publications now compared to fewer than six a decade ago, Husni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing competition, Money magazine recently
chose to tone down under the leadership of Safian, its newly
installed managing editor, beginning with its October issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sorts of headlines are no longer in the magazine --
(such as) `We'll make up to 67 percent this year,' '' he said.
``We're working hard not to promise things we can't deliver. We
want readers to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiffres prefers more conservative headlines as well: ``In
general, it's better not to build up expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman doesn't like blaring headlines and avoids them in
Consumer Reports. ``We don't do it because we think it's
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   SmartMoney's Gilbert said readers know headlines carry a certain
exaggeration, balanced by a more conservative tone in the article.
``Readers understand that there's a certain hyperbole built in
because the publication wants to catch your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Crippen, a 70-year-old animated-film producer who
lives in Winnetka, disagrees. He bought four stocks two years ago
that were recommended by an investment magazine and lost money on
all. ``I thought they knew what they were doing. You figure that
they are smarter than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he understand that hyperbole was built into the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I buy something if I thought they were exaggerating?
I just want it straight. Don't play it up to get me to buy the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which isn't to say personal finance magazines aren't
useful.
</P>
<P>
   They're good resources for checking out investment
recommendations proffered by your financial adviser, said Barbara
Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation
of America in Washington. The publications also offer investment
ideas that readers should further investigate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Readers benefit from research conducted by personal finance
magazines, which have the time, resources and executive-level
contacts most individual investors don't have in order to properly
screen a company, said Safian of Money.
</P>
<P>
   Readers don't need hyped headlines and magazines can succeed
without them. Just look at Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's annual mutual fund issue is one of the most
popular covers among its 4.5 million subscribers. On the
newsstands, it's also one of the best sellers, Richman said.
</P>
<P>
   But headline hype isn't the cause. This year's spring issue was
titled ``Funds &AMP; Gains.'' Last year? ``Mutual Funds You Can Live
With.''

   MIDEAST-SCENE _ WYE MILLS, Md. _ With a roaring fire to ward off
autumn's chill, a table of veal and fish for sustenance and
stirring words from an ailing monarch, President Clinton led
Israeli and Palestinian leaders through a sleepless quest for
peace, winding up nine days of sequestered summitry with 27
unbroken hours of soul-searching, compromise and hard bargaining.
By sunrise Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had agreed on a dramatic
land-for-security plan that broke a 19-month impasse in the
tortured Mideast peace process. But as aides readied gleaming black
limos and the president's olive green and white helicopter to ferry
the leaders to an official signing ceremony on the White House lawn
70 miles away, the parties hit a pothole on the pathway to peace.
''We have clearly hit a snag and are trying to work our way through

NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER CENTER FOR LATIN AMERICAN ART OPENS IN SAN
ANTONIO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin
American Art, opening Saturday, is a welcoming, light-filled space
housing art from many nations and 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000-square-foot, $11 million addition to the San Antonio
Museum of Art contains about 2,500 works of folk, pre-Columbian,
viceregal and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Although at this juncture it is only an exhibition hall, the
center's third story eventually will house a library, research
facilities, seminar rooms and space for visiting scholars.
</P>
<P>
   It was named for the late U.S. vice president and New York
governor in recognition of contributions by his family to the
center and to the museum's collections. Just as important, the
museum explains, the name also serves ``as a memorial to
Rockefeller's steadfast efforts to gain understanding and
recognition of Latin American culture in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's love affair with art from south of the Rio Grande
began on his first visit to Mexico in 1933. Over the years, he
amassed great collections of pre-Columbian, modern and folk art. He
gave the pre-Columbian material to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York, which incorporated it into the Michael Rockefeller
wing, named for one of his sons. Most of his contemporary
paintings, including those by Latin American artists, went to the
Museum of Modern Art, where he had served as board president.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of his folk art collection, an estimated
2,500 pieces, was presented as a gift to SAMA in 1985 by his
daughter, Ann R. Roberts. Considered to be the premier collection
of its kind in the world, it spans five decades and forms the core
of the museum's folk art holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Museum regulars will undoubtedly be familiar with most of the
works on view. But in the center's fresh galleries, select objects
have more space and the potential to create intriguing, even
surprising consonances. Marion Oettinger, SAMA's senior curator,
designed the massive display with grace.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is divided into four primary areas on two of the
new wing's three floors. Folk and pre-Columbian art are on the
ground floor, just past the orientation gallery; works from the
colonial to modern period are on the second story. There are
powerful echoes from the majestic traveling exhibition ``Mexico:
Splendors of Thirty Centuries,'' which SAMA hosted in 1991. Segues
are smooth, for the most part, as one travels from the austere
stone idols carved by Olmec artisans to the ebullient baroque works
brought by the viceregal Spanish court, and from the rich hybrids
of the colonial period to the modern artists' multifaceted
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few stumbles. Contemporary New Mexico carver Felipe
Archuleta doesn't have much reason to be in a Latin American
collection, no matter how charming his creations, and the modern
works are pretty weak, including an insipid painting by Diego
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlights are generous.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter the L-shaped center through the three-story,
translucent orientation gallery. It houses interactive computers
(funded by Rockefeller's sons, Mark and Nelson Jr., whose
inheritance included a ranch in South Texas) with general
information on Latin American culture, history and religion, and
specifics about the collection.
</P>
<P>
   High above, in a protective niche, a colonial stone image of the
Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos stands with arms in a gesture of
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition galleries then open with richly colored walls and
design elements intended to enhance content.
</P>
<P>
   Folk art comes first, displayed in rooms of deep burgundy-rust
walls and doorways topped by heavy wooden lintels. Oettinger
arranged the works in three distinct though permeable areas _
ceremonial objects, utilitarian ones and playful things.
</P>
<P>
   While overall quality is beyond reproach, a few items stand out
for beauty and uniqueness, including a mandolin from the 1930s with
its armadillo shell body and a painted front. There's a terrific
19th-century figure of a seated monkey wearing a hat, carved from
blond wood, and animated from the smile on his simian face to his
slender, almost human fingers.
</P>
<P>
   A tin gazebo populated by clay musicians from around 1900
anchors one end of a display. At the other is Rockefeller's famous
``Garza'' (crane), probably from the 1930s, in which the anonymous
artist from Olinala, Mexico, extracted the graceful semblance of
the long-legged bird from a gourd.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Columbian space, with entrances cut like Maya arches,
offers exceptional variety and quality. Works in clay, stone and
copper from Mexico to Peru reflect the civilization and
craftsmanship that pre-dated the arrival of the Spanish in the
beginning of the 16th century. There's a Zapotec urn circa 300 B.C.
in black clay, and a Toltec stone figure, circa 900 B.C., of a
deity with knotted ropes around her waist and feathered serpents
around her eyes and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A polychrome Maya platter, circa A.D. 600, from Peten (in
Guatemala) of a ruler smoking a cigar and sitting on a jaguar
throne is among the most famous works of its kind. A very fine
tripod ``metate'' (grinding stone) from Costa Rica, with its
fretwork base, and an exquisite Mixtec mask from around 1500, with
features covered by diminutive turquoise ``tesserae'' and
mother-of-pearl fangs, speak of highly skilled artists.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial and republican collections, presented in
cream-colored, vaulted-arch spaces, include decorative, religious
and utilitarian pieces. This is the period least well-known and
-understood, as complicated historically as it is aesthetically.
The excesses of the viceregal court and the wealth of the Catholic
Church were in ample evidence during the 17th and 18th centuries,
with baroque and churrigueresque styles developing throughout
Spanish America. Neoclassicism, with its sober forms and clear
lines, appears in the mid-19th century as the colonies plunge into
wars of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a tiny 18th-century Christ with Asian features. It
represents the ocean trade that connected the Spanish crown with
its possessions in Asia and New Spain. The Manila-Acapulco route
established in 1565 increased trade with China, where this figure
probably was made.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights range from a beautiful silver incense burner in
the shape of an armadillo from 18th-century Peru, to a charming,
1860 primitive painting of the Cathedral in Mexico City by an
anonymous artist, to the celebrated statue of Santa Teresa de Avila
from Guatemala. Dating from the 17th century, this extraordinary
figure stands about one-half life-size, her sumptuous gown one of
the foremost examples of ``estofado,'' a Spanish technique in which
the outermost coat of paint is punched to reveal the gold leaf
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The last section, on modern and contemporary art, is a letdown.
Although some big names are here _ Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, even
Frida Kahlo from the early part of the century _ it's a feeble
gathering. And it doesn't improve with contemporaries such as

   But as visitors wend their way back to the main floor, some
interesting relationships emerge. Several of the 20th-century
pieces point the viewer back to earlier pictures, from which the
artists took their clues. Two notable examples are Carlos Merida's
illustrative watercolors of costumes and market scenes _ which
relate directly to ``pintura costumbrista,'' the character study
painting of the 19th century. Kahlo's still life painting of fruit
with its brilliant green parrot is a direct descendant of the nave
painting by an unknown artist in the folk art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   It's a satisfying circle.

OBIT-WINNIE (Undated) - Winnie Ruth Judd, Arizona's most infamous
murders, has died. She was accused of murdering two women in the
early 1930s and shipping their bodies, one cut to pieces, to Los
Angeles. Judd ended up cheating the executioner. By PAT FLANNERY.

 &QL; 
SANPEDRO-PRESERVE (Undated) - In an effort to save the endangered
Southwestern willow flycatcher and some of Arizona's best desert
forests, an environmental group on Saturday will dedicate the San
Pedro River Preserve. This is the 13th preserve in Arizona run by
the Nature Conservancy, which now protects more than 28 square
miles of wildlife habitat across the state. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story

 &QL; 
PAPERLESS-OFFICE-ART (Phoenix) - There are high-speed scanners,
computers and programs to organize it all, but desks from the
corner office to the cubical remain buried in paper. ``We call it a
technical chasm _ making the transition from the tangible document
that were so secure with to an electronic copy,'' said Andrew
Bates, an account manager at IPRO Inc., a Phoenix company that
scans paper documents and puts them onto CD-ROM. While the company
can put up to 15,000 pages onto a single disc, it makes much of its
money by printing out digital images for its clients. Sort of
making things un-paperless again. With PHOTO. By REBECCA ROLWING.
Story moved in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - There's nothing worse than a good
player gone bad. Case in point: Oakland wide receiver Tim Brown.
Last year, he led the AFC in receiving with 1,408 yards. This year,
he's amassed a whopping 317 yards and one touchdown. There's always
some lesser-known player who might be the answer. But you know the
minute you start the other guy, Brown will ring up 472 yards, score
six touchdowns and cement lasting peace in the Middle East. There's
just nothing worse than benching your money player when they have a
big game. By BILL MULLER. Story moved in the ``S'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXICANS (Mexico City) - Consider us distant relations. We have the
same blood running through our veins, the same surnames,
complexion, and religion. To varying degrees, we even speak the
same language. But we see the world in radically different ways.
We're separated by history and pride. More than that, we're
separated by memory. Fifty years from now, Americans in Iowa or
South Dakota will know what Arizonans, who live on the border with
Mexico, already know - that the fate of America in a new century is
hopelessly tied to that of the now 90 million Mexicans living to
the south. By RUBEN NAVARETTE JR. Story will move in the ``K''
category. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 25. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THEBOX (Undated) - I want to acknowledge a debt. It comes as a bit
of an ugly confession. And it comes wrenchingly from my throat: I
write a great deal about books and poetry. I spout Roman history a
little too glibly and am apt to swoon glowingly about Homer's
Iliad. But I must acknowledge that the high tone of fine art and
literature is only a patina. I have been most hewn and polished not
by literary sources, but by television. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story

MANY WRITERS LACK FINANCE DEGREES
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Resending for possible weekend use) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Just what are readers buying?
</P>
<P>
   Personal finance magazines offer their readers the stock
recommendations of Wall Street pundits like star mutual fund
managers, plus investment picks from the magazine's editors and
reporters. Then there are the company profiles and interviews with
executives, among other stories.
</P>
<P>
   Experts of Wall Street featured in these publications have to
possess a stellar investment record before any national magazine
gives them ink. But that's not the case with the magazines' own
journalists who often step into the role of investment guru.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at Money, SmartMoney and Kiplinger's said they and their
staff carry years of financial reporting experience that equip them
to make good recommendations. (Worth did not comment.) For an
expert opinion, they also might bounce ideas off proven fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
   But most don't have either a formal education in finance, such
as an MBA or college business degree, or credentials such as a
certified financial planner designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what qualifies a person to analyze stocks,''
said Jersey Gilbert, financial editor for SmartMoney magazine in
New York. He argues that a business degree does not guarantee great
stock picking. Instead, SmartMoney recruits reporters with
analytical skills and trains them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Schiffres, senior associate editor at Kiplinger's magazine
in Washington, said he's been writing about personal finance since
the mid-1980s and feels ``very comfortable with my abilities in
this area'' especially ``in a world filled with 28-year-old fund
managers.'' He also consults with mutual fund managers he holds in
high regard, those with proven track records.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Consumer Reports' financial editor Lou Richman has
an MBA and so do three of his four financial writers. The magazine
is more a consumer advocacy publication than a traditional business
news publication.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richman says that while it helps to have an MBA,
journalists don't have to possess a business degree to do their
jobs well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are personal finance journalists who have been
covering the industry for so long that they've learned a lot, said
Barbara Levin, executive director of Forum For Investor Advice, a
nonprofit group in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``there's no guarantee these people know what they're
talking about. They don't have to have a history of success,'' said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Bryant Quinn of Newsweek, one of the most famous personal
finance columnists in America, frowns on journalists becoming stock
pickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reporters today are . . . turning themselves into
financial advisers by picking, or promoting, mutual fund and stocks
in print -- trading on their credibility as a disinterested
source,'' she wrote in the March/April 1998 issue of the Columbia
Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We justify it by saying `Better us than a stock salesperson.
Besides, look how our stocks or funds have soared,' '' she wrote.
``What kind of geniuses will we be when stocks go down?''

SIERRA CLUB PLAYS HARDBALL POLITICS VIA ISSUE-ADVOCACY ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., N.Y., Nev., Calif., Wis., Mo., Hawaii, Ill., Wash.,
Colo.)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last spring and summer, officials at the Sierra Club gathered
for a series of confidential meetings to plot how to make the
environment an issue in elections around the United States. But
their deliberations often had little to do with such matters as
polluted streams or global warming. Instead, they focused on
political tactics _ which candidates to help and which to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who has often been denounced by
environmentalists, would be a target; his own hog farm was said to
be a big polluter. Another Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., appeared less vulnerable. ``The problem with D'Amato is he
doesn't do a lot of dumb things,'' the group's media consultant
said. They decided to help Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. _ until he
crossed them by voting the wrong way on an environmental bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club officials insist that they do not play politics.
Their advertising, they say, simply seeks to educate voters about
issues. In the last two years, however, the Sierra Club has spent
more than $6 million to make itself heard in 15 House and 8 Senate
contests. And it is just one of dozens of interest groups spending
millions on advertisements that dodge campaign finance laws and
prohibitions on political activity by being labeled ``issue
advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the AFL-CIO to the Republican and Democratic parties, from
the health care industry to groups of religious conservatives, the
advertising has proliferated to the degree that some candidates
complain that they have lost control of their own messages. This
year, independent groups are spending at least $260 million to
press their issues in television advertisements, twice the amount
they spent in 1996, according to a study by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   While the din of the Clinton scandal in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation has led some groups to spend relatively less on
television this year and more on get-out-the-vote campaigns, the
commercials are more prevalent than ever; in many cities they have
dominated the airwaves over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club made possible a case study of this important new
phenomenon by allowing a reporter to attend its strategy meetings
and to examine its internal memorandums over several months. The
result shows that even groups like the Sierra Club, known to many
people for its scenic calendars and nature books, can play politics
as ferociously as any other interest group.
</P>
<P>
   With 550,000 dues-paying members, the Sierra Club is the
nation's oldest and largest grass-roots environmental organization.
Of its annual budget of $42 million, $12 million is devoted to
lobbying and policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   In strategy meetings week after week, Sierra Club officials made
no secret of their goal: helping to elect Democrats with solid
records on the environment _ it is backing only two Republicans,
both moderates _ and to defeat their foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be even more focused in choosing places where we
want to attempt to unseat anti-environmental opponents, and spend
significant resources per race to do so,'' the club's political
director, Daniel Weiss, wrote in a memorandum to his bosses on
Sept. 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The club has a political action committee, which spends some
money on direct political advertising in about a half dozen races.
But its efforts overwhelmingly involve the more subtle ``issue
ads,'' which escape federal election regulations and spending
limits by not expressly endorsing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is so concerned that it not be perceived as
exploiting election laws that it periodically issues staff
memorandums on what constitutes a legitimate issue ad. One advised
what to tell reporters who ask, ``Are you trying to influence this
political race?'' The recommended answer: the club's objective is
``to educate the public about the votes of our elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups are prohibited from contacting campaigns about
issue advertisements on their behalf. But the Sierra Club's
strategy is clearly to complement campaigns' own efforts. In
California, the club broadcast ads in May promoting the record of
Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, before her campaign began
advertising, allowing her to conserve her resources.
</P>
<P>
   Besides commercials, the Sierra Club has begun issuing 1 million
voter guides promoting candidates in pivotal races around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is really to roil the waters,'' the Sierra Club's
outside media consultant, Kim Haddow, said after one strategy
meeting. ``There's a big shrug out there. But we believe because
we're out there in their faces, the saliency of this issue will
rise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's decisions on where to channel its money are
far more complicated than simple questions about which candidates
most support its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year, officials at the club's headquarters in
San Francisco spoke on conference calls with their political staff
members in Washington, often debating practical considerations:
which candidates needed their help and had a reasonable chance of
winning; which contests offered opportunities to have an impact,
which regions had strong Sierra Club field operations.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, for example, officials agreed that Faircloth should
be aa target because of his hog farm. The club's associate
political director, Chris Norman, said: ``All the pundits here say
Faircloth looks vulnerable. He has a huge pig farm and he has a
deplorable rating'' on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``The only problem is the local chapter is not as
sophisticated as we'd like.'' The club decided to produce an
advertisement anyway, focusing on river pollution in North Carolina
and mentioning Faircloth's farm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senator's general counsel in Washington, Sean Callinicos,
said the Sierra Club had overblown a minor incident on the farm
when ``cattle feed spilled into a creek as a result of vandalism
from a disgruntled employee.'' The ad was no surprise, he said,
because ``the Sierra Club is simply part and parcel of the D.C.
Democratic establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Weiss, the political director, and Ms. Haddow, the outside
media consultant, usually had the most to say about the broad
political landscape, the club's top officials often deferred to
staff members in the field to tell them how races looked.
</P>
<P>
   One who got his way was the Midwest field director, Carl
Zichella, who in midsummer sent an e-mail to several officials to
head off the Washington staff, which wanted to pull back from
aiding Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., opposed by Rep. Mark Neumann,
a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early soft polling has lulled some folks into a sense of
complacency about the Neumann-Feingold race,'' he wrote. ``THIS IS
VERY DANGEROUS. I believe that Senator Feingold is threatened by
low turnout and easy access to campaign resources from right-wing
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing fresh polls that showed the race tightening, the
group relented, agreeing to finance two more weeks of ads to help
Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Sierra Club acts purely out of concern _ or
distress _ about a candidate's votes. In July, Ms. Haddow urged her
colleagues to cut back plans to help Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., in a
tough re-election fight. He had just voted for a bill that could
make it easier for developers to evade local planning regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said, ``I would rather spend the money on someone who is
with us other than Harry Reid.'' The officials, saying it was the
latest of several disappointing votes by Reid, then canceled three
weeks of radio advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club tries to stay flexible enough to make
last-minute adjustments. Early in the year it had high hopes in
Missouri for Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat running for the
Senate against Republican incumbent Christopher Bond. But in
midsummer the group shelved $17,260 from the race _ a week's worth
of radio ads _ after concluding that Nixon was waging a lackluster
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond seems like a no-brainer,'' Ms. Haddow said of the
decision to not help Nixon. She added that the incumbent's record
on the environment had improved ``because we've been whacking on
him'' in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Nixon, Allen Mattison, acknowledged that the
campaign had had problems. ``It's a very different race now than it
was five months ago,'' he said. Asked if he was disappointed that
the Sierra Club had decided to be less active, he said, ``The
Sierra Club members that I've seen have been very active here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials regularly looked for races where they could trim
budgets to conserve resources for tighter contests later in the
season. While Representative Neil Abercrombie was ``in big
trouble'' in Hawaii, Weiss and Ms. Haddow wrote, there was ``little
marginal utility'' in buying a fourth week of radio advertising.
The savings: $9,750.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the conversations were courteous. But at one session
Bruce Hamilton, the club's conservation director, complained
bitterly that his staff members seemed too quick to rejigger
spending priorities to conform to the latest polls or conventional
wisdom about a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very demoralizing to put the money out and to be
constantly changing signals,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   At a strategy meeting this summer, Weiss excitedly told his
colleagues about an idea for a ad to help Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill.,
who is being challenged by a Republican, Mark Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local organizer has actually found someone who's gotten
sick from drinking water contaminated by a hog farm,'' Weiss said.
``This person's story sounds fabulous! It would be great to get
this girl on camera because we'd have a human victim instead of a
dead fish, which is already in the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl could be used to personalize the danger that large hog
farms pose to public water supplies, Weiss said _ and to make the
point that Evans has worked to clean up his district's waters.
</P>
<P>
   It was too good to be true. The girl, it turned out, did not
live in Evans' district. And, Weiss said, ``We decided that didn't
want to seem like we were exploiting a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club has hardly been timid about spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars to attack its opponents. Last
December the organization commissioned focus groups in five states
to help develop messages for its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One of its biggest targets is Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., who is
aggressively challenging Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to hold Linda Smith accountable on water and
salmon,'' the director of the Northwest regional office in Seattle,
Bill Arthur, announced at a meeting in July. ``She is consistently
wrong on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club decided to focus on Ms. Smith's support for a
bill it says was intended to remove the ability of local
governments to protect salmon and limit suburban sprawl. To avoid
being accused of being political, the group likes to refer to
pending legislation in issue ads; in this case, a vote was pending
in Congress on budget bills that included money for enforcing clean
water laws.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Haddow and Weiss, back in Washington, D.C., entered
an editing studio to assemble the 30-second advertisement, they
spent much of their time looking for evocative pictures of salmon
and polluted water _ and scouring an illustrated field guide to
salmon to make sure they had the right fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people saying, `You guys don't know what you're
talking about,''' Weiss said, looking through the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haddow also said that to be most potent, the ad should give
viewers ``a sense of place.'' So she rejected a video clip of coho
salmon because the guide said Coho are not generally found in
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   They found footage of other salmon, but were not certain of the
type. ``They look like sockeye,'' Ms. Haddow said, comparing the
salmon on an editing screen with the field guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're pink enough for sockeye,'' Weiss
replied.
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to another fish in the salmon family. ``Are you
sure that's not a tuna?'' Weiss asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's a chinook,'' Ms. Haddow insisted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they settled on footage of king salmon teeming
upstream, juxtaposed against shots of bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator says: ``The Columbia ... the Columbia Gorge ...
Puget Sound ... king salmon _ all are threatened by development.
But instead of helping our communities rein in the sprawl and
pollution that's threatening our water quality and wild salmon,
congresswoman Linda Smith voted to make it easier for developers to
bypass local land-use decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new approach, the Sierra Club ran the advertisement just
before Labor Day. Usually, the most effective advertising is in the
weeks before an election. But rates are much cheaper in the summer
and there are fewer competing ads, so Sierra Club officials figured
they could get more attention and afford more ads by going early.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Troyer, a spokesman for the Smith campaign, said the
advertisement obscures the fact that Ms. Smith has ``a tremendous
record of balancing environmental votes and property rights
votes,'' and added: ``These attack ads are based upon partisan
politics. They selected competitive races where they can have an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible downside of the early advertising in Washington is
that the Senate race has not become as close as Sierra Club
officials expected. But the club maintains that its early ads
helped Senator Murray solidify her support among people who care
deeply about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sierra Club's advertising is over, but in Boulder,
Colo., the club has been broadcasting an ad over the past two weeks
with the goal of influencing one of the most competitive races in
the country, for the open seat in Colorado's 2nd Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to advertise in Boulder followed an unexpected
opportunity: the Republican candidate, Robert Greenlee, a wealthy
businessman and City Council member, was scheduled to vote in the
City Council on an environmental measure. That pending legislative
action enabled the Sierra Club to run an issue ad attacking
Greenlee's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of helping us protect our quality of life,'' the
announcer says as images of traffic jams and exhaust fill the
screen, ``City Councilman Bob Greenlee has voted against plans that
would have reduced traffic congestion, eased air pollution and
protected our open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about $50,000, the effort was not as large as some
in other states, and does not appear to have significantly shifted
the campaign to environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democratic candidate, Mark Udall, a state legislator
and avid mountain climber who is being outspent by Greenlee, said
he was thrilled to learn of the Sierra Club's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate their help,'' said Udall, the son of Morris
Udall, a longtime Arizona congressman who sought the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1976. ``I like the fact that they point
out how strong I am on the environment _ I need to get that message
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlee angrily accused the Sierra Club of twisting his record
and masquerading its efforts to damage his campaign behind the
label of ``issue advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me, to everyone, that the Sierra Club has
gone beyond the boundary of a nonprofit group,'' Greenlee said in
his office in Boulder as he brandished a Sierra Club flyer that
compared his record with Udall's. ``They're trying to push an
agenda and a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the objective comparison of records that is required by
law, Greenlee said, the flyer was ``clearly a campaign piece.''
</P>
<P>
   It is often difficult to determine just what impact a Sierra
Club campaign, or that of many advocacy groups, has in an election.
The groups' efforts rarely can be credited with shifting the
dynamic of a race. But the club's efforts can help put its
opponents on the defensive and, at the least, draw publicity in the
local news media.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss cites anecdotal evidence, like the fact that Matt Fong,
Boxer's Republican opponent in California, took a river rafting
trip after the Sierra Club ran an ad to help Ms. Boxer. He also
took credit for D'Amato's recent testimony at a hearing on acid
rain, saying he was spurred on because ``we've been beating on
D'Amato since April'' in ads.
</P>
<P>
   In the Colorado race, Greenlee said he feared that the Sierra
Club's campaign could cost him votes among swing voters that are
crucial in this election. ``It may have an impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than run advertisements countering the Sierra Club,
Greenlee said he planned to ignore it unless he appeared to be
losing significant support because of the effort. ``It's probably
better not to play into it,'' he said. ``You'd have to have the IQ
of a houseplant to do that.''

NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT SEEN BY REJECTION OF TEXAS NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP
SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HANSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The decision to kill plans for a low-level radioactive
waste dump in West Texas will have no immediate impact on how
Houston-area institutions and businesses store their waste,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission on Thursday
unanimously rejected a proposal to build the facility near Sierra
Blanca in Hudspeth County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed but we are ready to continue our search for
a disposal site,'' said Edward Selig of Advocates for Responsible
Disposal in Texas, an organization representing a coalition of
businesses, research institutions and other generators of
radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said waste will continue to be stored at more than 600
temporary sites across Texas, and that some of it will be shipped
to facilities in Utah and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Blanca facility, less than 20 miles from the Rio
Grande River, would have been used to store waste products from
hospitals, research institutions and nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The site was proposed by the Legislature in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition was based largely on concerns the ground is unstable
and that underground water supplies and the Rio Grande might be
contaminated by radiation leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said the issue of a low-level waste facility will probably
have to be tackled by the next Legislature, which convenes in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Low-level radioactive waste is generated from a wide variety of
activities in manufacturing, medicine and research, and one
potential user of the Sierra Blanca facility would have been
Houston Lighting &AMP; Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   Larry George, of HL&AMP;P, said the death of the waste dump will not
immediately impact its operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to ship to Barnwell, S.C., as long as we
can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, like other hospitals,
produces contaminated items such as gloves, pads, towels, syringes,
vials and other medical waste products.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's radiation safety officer, M.E. Norton, said the
decision not to build the facility in West Texas ``is not going to
have any short-term impact on us. What this means in the long term
is something we have to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   If the disposal site in South Carolina were to suddenly close,
Norton said, hospitals and other generators of waste would have to
find another facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they shut down, we will have a problem,'' he said. &QL;

READERS OF PERSONAL FINANCE MAGAZINES SHOULD DO EXTRA RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Resending for possible weekend use) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Investors should approach personal finance
magazines like they would any other source of investment advice:
with an open but inquiring mind.
</P>
<P>
   These publications are a good source of investment ideas and
company profiles, but investors should do their own research as
well, magazine editors and consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving people ideas,'' said Manny Schiffres, senior
associate editor at Kiplinger's magazine in Washington. ``We
certainly don't mean for people to take our ideas without further
research and buy that stock. ... The picks that appear in our
magazine are meant to be the starting point of the investment
process and not the ending point.''
</P>
<P>
   Since magazines don't have enough space to publish every
pertinent fact about an investment, readers should dig into it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what experts say investors should consult at the very
minimum even after reading a magazine recommendation:
</P>
<P>
   --Value Line's report on the company, which can be found at most
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   --The company's quarterly and annual earnings reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   --Pertinent news and press releases from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also should avoid trends -- like ``The Top 10 Mutual
Funds to Buy Now'' -- no matter how appealing the headline, said
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that it's not easy to predict the ``best
investments,'' she said. Don't take the magazine's word for it
without checking it out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, come up with a reasonable investment plan or strategy
that fits your needs and stick to it, Roper said. In general, it's
a good idea to keep expenses down, avoid exotic investment products
and save consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Consult a trusted financial adviser if your situation is
complicated.

TIME TO GIVE RUBE TUBE ITS DUE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED) - I want to acknowledge a debt. It comes as a bit of an
ugly confession. And it comes wrenchingly from my throat: I write a
great deal about books and poetry. I spout Roman history a little
too glibly and am apt to swoon glowingly about Homer's Iliad.
</P>
<P>
   But I must acknowledge that the high tone of fine art and
literature is only a patina. I have been most hewn and polished not
by literary sources, but by television. It is the same for most
people under the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   Television is not often enough considered when we talk about
intellectual development; it actually hurts to put the words
``intellectual'' and ``television'' in the same sentence _ and I
just did it twice. I'm a masochist.
</P>
<P>
   But it is true. My first introduction to Classical music was on
the Bugs Bunny cartoons I watched on the box. First introduction to
jazz from the added soundtrack to the silent Terrytoons I saw on
``Junior'' ``Frolics.''
</P>
<P>
   My first theater came in the form of sitcoms; first sculpture
was the Rodin ``Thinker'' that Dobie Gillis sat under to question
why he could never make time with Thalia Menninger.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were a few ``highbrow'' things on the tube: Sometimes
we watched ``Omnibus'' with Alistair Cook or the Young People's
Concerts with Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the effect of such educational shows was as a
single tiny green pea to the overwhelming harvest of corn that
poured out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanza,'' Ed Sullivan, Jackie Gleason, ``Ozzie and Harriet,''
Dave Garroway's meaty palm held forward to the screen as he intoned
the word, ``Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   I learned about animals from Ivan Sanderson and, later, Marlin
Perkins. I learned about Eastern Europe from Boris Badinov. It all
twirled around in a great pop-culture spin cycle.
</P>
<P>
   It's frightening to think how much American history was gathered
from watching Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp or Guy Madison as Wild
Bill Hickok.
</P>
<P>
   It is all still there, like petroleum under the covering layers
of rock. If I dig deep enough, the Tacitus recedes and the de Mille
comes back to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the generation that came after mine _ those
called ``X'' to my ``boomer'' _ is the quotes that have now been
put around everything that appears on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Television was new to us. We approached it naively. What we saw
on its glowing front we took to be an image of the real world.
Those that came after us were enormously more sophisticated about
what they saw. Television was for them clearly an ironic ``parallel
universe,'' which they somehow lived in, used for their cultural
reference point, but never took seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie and Harriet'' was not exactly the world I inhabited, but
it bore a close enough resemblance to it that I could read it as
``real.'' Ozzie really (begin ital) was (end ital) married to
Harriet.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the ``Brady Bunch'' came on, it so deviated from the
reality of its viewers that the only way to enjoy it was as an
in-joke.
</P>
<P>
   My generation learned about World War II from ``Victory at
Se''a; the following generation learned from ``Hogan's Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are pluses and minuses to both sides of the generational
equation. It is usually better to be sophisticated than naive. I'm
mortified that I ever thought that Gene Autry really (begin ital)
was (end ital) a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside for the later generation is the disconnect they
make between life and art. For them, culture is a web of references
they get, the way you either get or don't get Dennis Miller. If you
suggest to them that art might somehow illuminate their daily
existence and confront the questions that arise outside the TV
world, they look at you like you just suggested Don King should be
the next Batman.
</P>
<P>
   If we have all become much more knowing about the apparatus of
media, we are also in danger of drowning in that world in a kind of
cultural schizophrenia, and forgetting that the world that counts
is found outside prime time. &QL;

&HT;    POLLARD RELEASE DEMAND THREATENED TO UNRAVEL MIDEAST PEACE
ACCORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a decade ago U.S.-Israeli relations were
strained when a former U.S. Navy analyst was convicted of selling
secrets to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday that man, Jonathan Pollard, once again threatened to
damage ties between the two nations, when a coveted Mideast peace
agreement almost unraveled over Israel's demand that the former spy
be released to them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, warned against such a move by his
intelligence advisers, eventually prevailed in keeping Pollard's
fate out of the peace agreement. The president told Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would consider the matter in
the future but would not commit to any outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The snag, which delayed the agreement signing for much of the
day, brought back the controversy over Pollard, a hero to the most
religious and militant faction in Israel and a most dangerous spy
to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Pollard, a counterterrorism analyst with the Navy, was
arrested on charges of passing thousands of secrets to Israel in
return for $50,000. He was nabbed outside the Israeli Embassy where
he was seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard admitted to selling Israel military intelligence a room
full of documents, including satellite photographs and information
on Arab military systems. Two years later Pollard was sentenced to
life in prison for espionage. His wife, Ann, was sentenced to five
years as an accomplice. She served 40 months and later emigrated to
Israel. In 1990 she was divorced from Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that Pollard deserved the maximum punishment
because of the large volume and damaging nature of the material he
turned over to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Israeli officials disavowed any relationship with
Pollard saying his contacts were with a rogue operation.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years his release has become a cause celebre for
some Israelis and American Jews who believed that he has been too
harshly punished for trying to help a friendly ally.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has felt pressure from the most conservative elements
in his governing coalition, who have agitated for Pollard's
release.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's government recently granted Pollard citizenship
while acknowledging that he was an Israeli agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pollard case is an emotional issue in Israel. They really
consider him to be some sort of a hero,'' said Edward Djerejian,
the director of the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice
University and a former ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from some Jewish leaders, Clinton has so far
rebuffed efforts to release Pollard, who has remained behind bars
in a federal prison in Butner, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Clinton refused to grant clemency for the spy based on
recommendations from Central Intelligence Agency officers, who
argued that Pollard remained a danger because of the secret
military information he possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad guy, a guy who took the oath of office and was
entrusted with some of our most cherished secrets. He sold them to
a foreign government,'' said Cas Yost, the director of the
Institute of Diplomacy at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Galveston, Texas, Pollard, 43, was raised in South Bend,
Ind., where his father was a professor at Notre Dame University. He
later attended Stanford University and did graduate work in Boston
before coming to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing Pollard said, ``while my motives may have been
well-meaning, they cannot excuse or justify my actions. Having said
that, it is cold comfort for me to realize I was not intending to
harm the United States but to benefit an ally.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday both Pollard's detractors and supporters emerged to
either defend or criticize talk of his release.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, who was the U.S. prosecutor in the Pollard
case, argued that pardoning the former spy would be ``an outrageous
undercutting of American security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Pollard has nothing to do with the Middle East Peace
process,'' diGenova said before it became clear that Clinton was
not going to pardon Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pollard's current wife, Esther, said that releasing her
husband would be ``restoring the principle of equal justice to the
American Justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is serving the longest, harshest sentence in the
history of the United States for the one count of passing
classified information to an ally that he was indicted of,'' she
told Cable News Network. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Like a white-thatched Buddha, Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson sits on the bench in his black robes presiding in U.S.
District Court over a case summoned by his clerk as ``Civil Action
No. 98-1232, the United States of America vs. Microsoft Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   At the widely watched antitrust trial, John Warden, Microsoft's
lead lawyer, suspended his dogged cross-examination of the
government's star witness to note, ``I do all of my own work with a
fountain pen and a legal pad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had been taking copious notes with his fountain pen
on a legal pad, looked up and allowed a brief smile of recognition
to cross his normally impassive face.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the irony, the attorney for the world's biggest
software company put e-mail exhibits into the trial record with an
overhead projector that yielded fuzzy images that often couldn't be
read by the 80 spectators seated on wooden benches in the small
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, David Boies, the government's $300-an-hour hired gun,
deftly used razzle-dazzle computer blowups of e-mail messages to
and from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates to charge that Microsoft
violated the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act by willfully expanding its
monopoly over operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own low-tech preferences, Warden dubbed the
proceedings in Jackson's courtroom the ``return of the Luddites,''
citing the 19th century band of Englishmen who smashed machines
``to arrest the march of progress driven by science and
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To defend Microsoft's version of an industrial revolution,
Warden cited a message that Netscape Communications Corp. chief Jim
Barksdale had relayed to his troops after a June 4, 1995, meeting
with key Microsoft executives at the software giant's sprawling
campus in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attitude: very friendly, non-threatening,'' Barksdale,
Netscape's business-tested president and chief executive officer,
reported in a message labeled ``confidential'' and ``attorney
client privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys at Netscape have done a great job ... how can we work
together,'' Barksdale summarized the Microsoft comments, adding
that he was told the discussion took place with ``Bill's
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale testified that less than three weeks later, in a
reciprocal session at Netscape's Silicon Valley boardroom,
Microsoft threatened to ``kill'' Netscape by drawing a line around
its then-new Windows 95 operating system and the free Internet
browsing tool it buried deep within the proprietary Windows code.
</P>
<P>
   It is that exchange _ which Microsoft denies ever took place _
that serves as the nexus of the case against Microsoft filed last
May by the Department of Justice and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   But in a broad sense, the case revolves around two antithetical
views of the Information Age society as it hurtles toward the third
millennium. The ironies behind the courtroom props aside, a true
cultural clash permeates this trial, which enters its second week
on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government sees Microsoft's efforts to get its ``business
partners'' to support its core products _ and, in Netscape's case,
to shun the Windows browser market _ as a clear violation of the
antitrust laws. But Microsoft contends that it's common practice in
the fast-paced industry for firms to work together and compete
against each other at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government alleges that Microsoft has leveraged its huge
market power to force personal computer makers to give it top
billing on opening screens. But Microsoft contends it has a right
to protect its products by asking distributors to feature them in
an unmodified state.
</P>
<P>
   _ In giving its browser away as part of its Windows software,
the government says Microsoft intends to cripple its competitors.
But Microsoft contends bundling products is an accepted industry
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopolies have to be held to a different standard because
they have monopoly power,'' antitrust chief Joel Klein told a
gathering of computer industry leaders a day after the trial began.
By and large, the Supreme Court has found that conduct that could
be seen as innocent when engaged in by a competitor even with large
market share may be illegal when engaged in by a true monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, whose $52 billion in Microsoft stock makes him the
world's richest man, views the antitrust blitz against the firm he
took public in 1986 as illogical in terms of his world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates is the ultimate programming machine,'' says computer
guru Stewart Alsop. ``He believes everything can be defined,
examined, reduced to essentials, and rearranged into a logical
sequence that will achieve a particular goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that doesn't work this way, anything illogical, is
'random.' In the world of Bill Gates, being illogical is the most
serious sin.''
</P>
<P>
   In league with his wealthy client, Warden told the court that
monopolies can't exist in the digital realm where traditional
barriers to entry, such as huge factories, don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   All any new entrant needs, he asserted, is a good set of brains,
some startup funds and a computer. ``This is no comfortable or
quiet monopolist backwater,'' he asserted. If it were, he said,
Microsoft wouldn't be spending $3 billion a year on research.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a continent away from the trial, a small firm named
Mobile Insights announced a new all-purpose gizmo: an electrtonic
pen and tablet to replace yellow legal pads for note-taking. While
it's doubtful whether either Jackson or Warden will use it, the new
unit is slated to run on Microsoft's Windows CE operating system.

UNTYPICAL AUTO EXECUTIVE WRITES AN UNTYPICAL BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert A. Lutz is not your typical auto executive _ and that has
to be the understatement of the year in this space. The former
president and vice-chairman of Chrysler is a man of contrasts, a
denim-and-sneakers mind-set in double-breasted demeanor, a
cigar-loving, martini-drinking vegetarian _ and the guy who
engineered Chrysler's second resurrection from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Boston last week to visit with the New England Motor
Press Association and discuss corporate philosophy, the state of
American education, the history of Chrysler, business theory, cars
_ and, not incidentally, plug his new book, ``GUTS: The Seven Laws
of Business That Made Chrysler The World's Hottest Car Company''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $24.95 hardcover, 220 pp.).
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lutz is demonstrably brilliant, speaks several languages,
but didn't finish high school until he was 22. He is not your
typical All-American boy, either, having been born to a life of
wealth and privilege in Zurich; his father was a banker, his mother
inspired in him a love of cars. His father's business dealings
brought young Bob Lutz to America _ and into American public
schools _ frequently. Eventually, he did a stint in the Marine
Corps, earning fighter pilot's wings and a commission _ he still
flies, frequently at the controls of his Czech Albatros military
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually strait-laced Bob found himself at the University of
California at Berkeley, where he earned his undergraduate degree at
the ripe old age of 29, then went on to earn an MBA.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody is qualified to comment on the world of automobile
manufacturing, it is Lutz; he has labored here and abroad for four
of the majors _ General Motors, BMW, Ford, and Chrysler, landing at
the last in 1986. Chrysler, you may recall, had been snatched from
the jaws of bankruptcy by Lee Iacocca, who engineered concessions
from bankers and suppliers, cementing the arrangement with federal
loan guarantees _ it was not a government bailout, Lutz was quick
to remind us, but merely Uncle Sam as cosigner, not the lender. (In
fact, the goverment not only didn't lend Chrysler a dime but scored
a significant windfall for taxpayers from the company's comeback.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Lutz writes, the patient, having been cured, resumed the
unhealthy lifestyle. Now it was Lutz who would engineer a recovery
_ this time without federal guarantees. ``Leadership is what
enabled Chrysler to turn around,'' Lutz said _ and Lutz would lead,
bringing a right-brain approach to bear on a left-brain business.
Plus the Seven Laws of Lutz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el6 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; L &UR; xr &LR; utz Law No. 1: The customer is not always right.
Customers don't always know what they want, Lutz says, and
customers often lie about what they want. The proof of that is in
the so-called focus groups wherein customers are surveyed about
wants in future product. Customers will invariably opt for the
practical, for more of everything, and indicate willingness to pay
_ in focus groups. Left-brain, practical, answers. But in the
market, decisions are more likely to be based on emotion tempered
by wallet _ they want pizazz, can't always pay for the stuff they
say they'd like to have.
</P>
<P>
   The result of focus-group design is frequently boring cars.
``Don't ask the customer to do your creative work,'' Lutz commands.
It is better, he says, to go with a car that excites a minority
than a car that is merely acceptable to the majority.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the first Law of Lutz strange, the second should
really floor you: The primary goal of business is not to make
money. ``Some companies confuse the mission with the reward,'' Lutz
explains. ``Focus on the product and the customer and the money
will follow,'' he says. This is heresy in some corporate halls
where the rate of return is the focus of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission at Chrysler is to build cars people will enjoy and
want to buy again,'' Lutz says _ and Chrysler is making more money
than ever, so maybe the man is right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el6 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; T &UR; xr &LR; oo much quality can ruin you, is another Law of
Lutz, and that got him going on the subject of J.D. Powers'
customer satisfaction surveys, the generally accepted measure of
quality (at least in the press). ``We have permitted Powers to
define quality as the absence of negatives,'' Lutz said. ``That is
like defining food quality as the absence of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cars today have bulletproof reliablility,'' Lutz said. But
customers may be madly desirous of some cars even though the defect
rate is not at the top of the Powers chart. Dodge Viper illustrates
the point, Lutz offered, an outrageously powered (400 horspeower,
V-10 engine) sports car with no roof, no door handles, and no side
windows when it came out, yet it took the world by storm,
completely sold out, and gave Chrysler an image as an innovative
car company. Viper was a product of the right brain _ the
left-brained side of the company counseled against building it.
</P>
<P>
   Teamwork isn't always a good thing, another Lutz-ism counsels.
Business has ``become enamored of teams as a solution to
everything,'' Lutz says, but it's often just a ``copout of
management avoiding a decision. Spending time seeking consensus is
not the same as doing work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership to Lutz is about common sense, and common sense
dictates that we hold each other accountable _ we need to be
outraged, he advises. If we accept mediocrity or shoddy goods and
services without complaint, then we encourage them, Lutz says.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz really does believe in cooperation and teamwork, though, as
long as it's OK to make waves in pursuit of excellence. He has
instituted a whole new kind of teamwork at Chrysler, the platform
teams responsible for car development. He is a maverick who has
risen to power and achievment in the corporate world where
mavericks traditionally are outcasts. Lutz leaves it to F. Scott
Fitzgerald to explain his paradoxical nature: ``The test of
intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas and still
function.'' That would make Lutz a genius, in Fitzgerald's terms.
</P>
<P>
   He's a maverick in anybody's terms, a man who convinced Iacocca
to build Viper, brought it in under budget and ahead of schedule;
who would drive a new Jeep through a plate glass window at
Detroit's Cobo Hall or drop a new Dodge Ram from the ceiling _ the
focus groups, by the way, were turned off by the Ram, but Lutz got
it built anyway. And there's Prowler, plus a whole slew of
eye-grabbing concept cars.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we didn't hear from Lutz: ``brand management,'' the
current buzzword among the Chrysler competition. Chrysler has been
there, done that, abandoned it. It works for soap, not cars, Lutz
wrote in his book. Chrysler is in the car business.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the Lutz Laws and a good lesson in creative
business philosophy, you can buy and read the book. Lutz doesn't
need the dough, but it would be a good thing if he sold a lot of
copies _ to General Motors. They could use his expertise over
there. If this were the movies, the GM board would offer him the
helm. Now that would make a great book.

NEC CHAIRMAN SEKIMOTO RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A military-procurement scandal ended the career Friday
of one of Japan's eminent executives, Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman
of the NEC Corp., the world's second-largest maker of computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Sekimoto resigned to take responsibility for a scandal that has
received little attention outside Japan but has been avidly
followed in business circles here because of the involvement of
NEC, one of the bluest of Japan's blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said at a news conference that he would also resign other
positions, including an influential post at the Keidanren, the
nation's largest business organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sekimoto, 71, has not been tied to the scandal, but Japanese
corporate mores demand the resignation of senior executives as
atonement for the sins of the companies they run. ``I would like to
make clear my social responsibility for the scandal that has been
bothering society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hisashi Kaneko will remain as president of NEC. It is unclear
how soon the company will choose a new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 13 people from NEC and its two subsidiaries, the Nico
Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co., have been
arrested by the Defense Agency on suspicion of overcharging the
Japanese military on procurement contracts. Three of those arrested
are current NEC executives.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the NEC affiliates overcharged a total of nearly
1.7 billion yen, or $14.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two Defense Agency officials also have been arrested, suspected
of ignoring the inflated billings. When the agency demanded a
refund, NEC and its subsidiaries were said to have conspired with
at least one senior official in the procurement department to
reduce the amount by more than 3 billion yen _ upward of $25
million _ in exchange for bribes and promises of comfortable jobs
for retiring agency bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese news media have reported that some local governments
and their contractors, which are estimated to account for 10
percent of NEC sales, have excluded the company from bidding on
projects for a limited time because of the scandal. But analysts
said it was likely to have little effect on NEC's business.
</P>
<P>
   Executives have been fascinated with the scandal _ yet another
in a string of disclosures of a lack of integrity among government
bureaucrats _ because many suspect that NEC insiders may have
tipped the Defense Agency to the scheme in an effort to unseat
Sekimoto.
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese companies, most decision-making power typically
rests with the president, while the chairman's job is largely
ceremonial, except in those companies where that post is filled by
a founder.
</P>
<P>
   NEC was an exception. Although Sekimoto was elevated to chairman
in 1994, both insiders and outsiders believed he retained much of
the power he had enjoyed for 14 years as president. He remained as
the public face of the company, and he became a favorite voice of
the Japanese corporate world, speaking out on the domestic economic
situation and advocating business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say he skillfully used his strong, powerful
personality to rise within NEC, strengthening its role in
telecommunications equipment and insuring that it became a
powerhouse in personal computers. Unlike such competitors as
Toshiba and Hitachi, NEC has not dallied in money-losing business
lines like household appliances, focusing instead on
high-technology markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, analysts at foreign investment banks hailed his
departure as a much needed breath of fresh air for NEC, which has
suffered less from the collapse of semiconductor prices and
competition in the personal computer market than some of its
competitors, but has resisted structural change.
</P>
<P>
   ``His departure will be viewed as a positive,'' said Steven W.
Myers, senior analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities here. ``He is
viewed as an old-style Japanese manager, more interested in market
share and sales growth than in profitability, and showing little
concern'' for shareholders' interests.
</P>
<P>
   NEC shares rose 41 yen on Friday to close at 944.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, the company announced sharply lower
earnings for the six months that ended on Sept. 30. It cited the
steep fall in semiconductor prices, the domestic recession and
decreased spending by telecommunications companies for a net loss
of 19.73 billion yen, or $166 million at current exchange rates,
compared with a profit of 35.76 billion yen in the corresponding
period a year earlier. Sales dropped almost 11 percent, to 2.1
trillion yen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sekimoto is blamed for NEC's continuing investment in Packard
Bell NEC, a struggling personal computer maker in Cupertino, Calif.
Although NEC bought its initial stake in Packard Bell after
Sekimoto's time as president ended, he is widely seen as the
driving force behind the investment. Since 1995, when it paid $1.3
billion for a 20 percent stake in Packard Bell, then the No. 1
seller of personal computers, NEC has invested at least $525
million, and many analysts here say it is throwing good money after
bad.
</P>
<P>
   NEC now owns 52.81 percent of Packard Bell, which recently
announced plans to cut 20 percent of its work force in the face of
increasing competition in low-priced personal computers. NEC has
been overtaken by Compaq and Dell in the household market, and it
has found breaking into business computing more difficult than it
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people at the company are now going to look at the
investment in Packard Bell more objectively,'' said Peter Wolff, a
high-technology analyst with ING Barings here.

2 NATO GENERALS TO WARN MILOSEVIC OF AIR RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ NATO ambassadors in Brussels on Friday ordered the
alliance's two top generals to Belgrade on Saturday to warn
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic again that he would face air
strikes unless he ordered troops and special police units to
withdraw from Kosovo Province or return to barracks by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic agreed to the withdrawals from the province in
southern Serbia 10 days ago under the threat of air strikes, but
the alliance later suspended action to give him time to comply.
Serbian forces have still been firing on ethnic Albanian villages
and preventing tens of thousands of refugees from returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, the supreme commander of
NATO, and Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, its highest European
military chief, are to warn Milosevic this weekend that they have
authority to order air strikes after 8 p.m. local time Tuesday (2
p.m. Eastern time), allied officials in Brussels said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the officials added, the allied governments could also
instruct their ambassadors in Brussels to prolong the deadline
again if Milosevic showed signs of finally complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic may have decided that the threat of air strikes is
not as great this week as it was last week,'' an allied official
said, ``and that's why we're sending the two generals to
Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels said Milosevic had ordered one army
brigade last week to move out of Kosovo, as he had agreed to do in
the agreement he reached Oct. 13 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the officials said, a military police battalion
failed to withdraw as agreed and two Yugoslav army units normally
stationed in Kosovo were sent out of their barracks into the field,
supposedly to counter attacks by the Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic
Albanians fighting for independence for the province. Kosovo is
part of Serbia but had autonomy until Milosevic abolished it in
1989.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The units in the field are not being used to fight the Kosovo
Liberation Army, but to take villages hostage,'' an allied official
said. ``We don't want to see the Yugoslav army deployed against
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Clark's third mission to Belgrade since Oct. 12. He
and Naumann are to report Sunday to allied ambassadors, who will
decide by Tuesday what to do next, officials said. One diplomat
said the allies were aware that extending the deadline yet again or
watering it down could damage their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   NATO authorized its commanders to go ahead with air strikes, but
later suspended the order after the United Nations Security Council
adopted a resolution calling on Yugoslavia to withdraw the
motorized special police forces, tanks and army units that it first
sent into the province in February to quell the separatist revolt.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution called for a cease-fire and for guarantees that
international organizations would be unhindered in attempts to
provide aid to thousands of refugees who had taken to the hills to
get away from the fighting. Some 10,000 are still without shelter,
according to reports from the province, which is home to 2 million
people, 90 percent of them ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has worked with the allies to press Milosevic to
stop the attacks, parted ways with them when the allies agreed with
the United States that the resolution authorized the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes a proposed Security Council resolution, demanded
by Canada and other countries, that would authorize NATO to protect
up to 2,000 observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe that Milosevic agreed to accept to monitor
the situation in Kosovo after a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has said it would refuse to provide observers unless they
had clear protection. Russia, as a permanent member of the Security
Council, has the power to veto the resolution.

GOVERNOR, FEMA VOW QUICK AID FOR TEXAS FLOOD VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERO, Texas _ With frustration growing among flood victims and
damage estimates that could top $1 billion statewide, Gov. George
W. Bush reassured residents of this ravaged city Friday that help
is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is on the way,'' Bush told one resident during a
stop at Cuero High School with James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everything we can get,'' said Carrie Brown, 69, one of
hundreds of people sheltered at the school since the Guadalupe
River jumped its banks and tore through town Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine people were killed statewide as a result of storms
that triggered severe floods in South and Central Texas and
tornadoes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing grants and loans to residents, Witt
told local officials that federal funds would be available to
reimburse the costs of debris removal and infrastructure damage and
possibly for the creation of a mobile home park to house flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
   He said 6,000 applications for emergency assistance had been
received from people who called FEMA's help line at 800-462-9029.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced five Houston-area counties will join the 20
already covered by the disaster declaration approved by President
Clinton earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing right now is to meet the immediate
housing need,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, whose district includes
15 of the counties in the disaster area, predicted the statewide
damage total would more than double the projected $500 million
estimate state officials offered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with insurers experienced in disaster claims,
Armbrister said, ``They're saying, cumulatively, damage in the four
river courses could very easily reach $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not anything official _ just a ballpark estimate from
people in the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooding was logged on the San Antonio, Guadalupe, Brazos and
Colorado rivers after rains last weekend dumped as much as 24
inches in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush handed out hugs, autographs and a dose of hope to many
shelter residents who were feeling overlooked and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people here waiting to see if somebody
would come,'' said shelter resident Terry Nobles, 40.
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt County Judge Ben Brause called the visit by Bush and Witt
``a double shot in the arm'' for disconsolate residents.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't do much for Pat Mercer, 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk is not enough. I want action,'' said Mercer, who
complained that erroneous forecasts that flooding would not occur
until Wednesday left her just 15 minutes to flee her home ahead of
rising waters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked by 17-year-old Venus Pena, ``Is everyone going to
be treated equally?''
</P>
<P>
   His response: ``We're going to make sure you get treated fairly
and equally.''
</P>
<P>
   Irene Romero chimed in: ``Our neighborhoods, the poor
neighborhoods, are always the ones that get left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to see it before I believe we're really going to
get help,'' said Romero, 50. ``Promises aren't going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Witt for getting quick federal assistance for
Texans in other recent weather disasters, adding, ``It seems like
there's an emergency every other week in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   The muddy floodwaters had receded considerably since the
Guadalupe River crested at record levels in many areas on Tuesday.
Pieces of homes, abandoned cars and farm equipment were left behind
as the flooding subsided, as were miles of torn-down fences and
torn-up roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five percent of the city is destroyed,''said Cuero
Mayor Michael Thamm, who has instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew for
non-residents in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still inundated are the water treatment plants in Cuero and the
nearby towns of Victoria and Goliad, spilling millions of gallons
of raw sewage into the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Thamm said it could be a month or much longer before sewage
treatment resumes in this town of 7,000, located about 75 miles
east of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have lost our plant,'' he said. ``It's still under
water.''

   Even though the Bowl Championship Series is planning to pit the
nation's two best teams in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, there could
be controversy. There are eight undefeated teams. And there could
be at least seven at the end of the season (undefeateds Tennessee
and Arkansas play each other).
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the scenario that causes faster heartbeats among
those who want a college football playoff:
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Ohio State and UCLA continue the season undefeated and
play in the Fiesta Bowl. But what if Tennessee, Kansas State and
Wisconsin also win out? While the BCS would name the Fiesta winner
its national champion, what if another team finishes undefeated? Or
teams?
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Playoff People will come scurrying from their
caves, waving their brackets and chanting, ``We wanna playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   In most years, I would be leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   But a college football playoff would make the sport a
minor-league version of the NFL. And who needs that?
</P>
<P>
   Do you hear anybody talking about the NFL right now? (Cowboys
talk excluded.) Is there controversy about division or wild-card
races? Are there eight undefeated teams? Is there a buzz about the
regular season? No. No. No. No.
</P>
<P>
   If an eight-team college football playoff was in place, there
would be debate about whether undefeated Tulane and Marshall were
better than once-beatens Nebraska, Texas A&AMP;M, Florida and Florida
State. Big whoop.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy helps fuel college football. And it's a sport where
the regular season is meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``More so than in any sport,'' Southeastern Conference
commissioner Roy Kramer said. ``This week, the UCLA-California game
is a huge game. In the NFL, a team like Miami can lose a game and
not really be all that concerned about its postseason hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   If a Division I-A playoff happens, it will be because of money.
That's always a good reason, but it's not the right reason.
</P>
<P>
   The college football season is a drama that unfolds weekly. You
can assume, but not be assured. Texas A&AMP;M can beat Nebraska and
Temple can win at Virginia Tech. A playoff lessens the impact of
those games.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it looks like Ohio State and UCLA are the two best teams.
But before they play in the Fiesta Bowl, they both have to win out.
That means Ohio State must beat tormentor Michigan and UCLA must
win at Washington, beat old rival Southern California and survive a
cross-country trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With over six weeks remaining, there is interest and intrigue
remaining. Those are words rarely associated with the NFL.

Notre Dame's decision
</P>
<P>
   New Big 12 Conference commissioner Kevin Weiberg won't leave the
Big Ten Conference until the end of the year. Over the next two
months, he'll continue work on a vital project.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg has been the point man on discussions that could result
in Notre Dame joining the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected by late December or early January. The
Big Ten basically has sent out an invitation and is waiting for
Notre Dame, which is a member of the Big East Conference in all
sports but football, to give its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of in Notre Dame's court at this point,'' said
Weiberg, who will brief Big Ten presidents when they meet Dec. 7.
``I think the Big Ten is kind of waiting to hear if there's
interest in any further discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Notre Dame says yes, the Big Ten would grow to 12 teams (no
word on whether it would change its already numerically challenged
name). That would allow the league to split into six-team divisions
and stage a championship game as the Southeastern and Big 12 does.
</P>
<P>
   And if Notre Dame answers the Big Ten proposal with ``We do,''
the next question will be what effect the Big Ten's expansion will
have on other conferences. Would the Big East survive? Would the
Atlantic Coast, Pacific-10, SEC and Big 12 feel the need to add to
or alter their membership to stay competitive in the television
market place?
Fighting words
</P>
<P>
   Southern California plays at Oregon today, a week after the
Ducks lost at UCLA in overtime. USC coach Paul Hackett might have
been trying to inspire his team, but he more than likely gave UCLA
more incentive for its game against the Trojans on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that Oregon was the best team in the Pac-10, even
after the Ducks' 41-38 loss at UCLA in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't turn the ball over against UCLA, they win the game
handily,'' Hackett told the ``Los Angeles Daily News''. ``To me,
Oregon is the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett then addressed the issue of whether his comments will
inspire and incite the Bruins against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA-USC is its own event,'' he said. ``It's its own separate
thing. I don't know if anything can be put on the bulletin board to
affect that rivalry. We're going to play UCLA in the distant
future, so I can't worry about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat in a hotel room and watched where one team
\ROregon\S kept turning the ball over and lost in overtime. I don't
mean that UCLA's not very, very good. That's my opinion at this
point, and it may not be true when we face UCLA.''
In quotes
</P>
<P>
   Northern Illinois coach Joe Novak after his team ended a 23-game
losing streak with a 16-6 victory against Central Michigan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I will only answer questions about our current winning
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach Bobby Wallace after his team's upset at Virginia
Tech:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course everybody's in shock, and rightfully so. I'm glad
we're off this week because it will take a little while to get
everybody's heads in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore after Virginia Tech's
shocking loss _ on homecoming _ to Temple:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so embarrassed in my life. I'm shellshocked.
We're the laughingstock of college football right now, and
deservedly so.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan offensive tackle Jeff Backus on last Saturday's game
with Northwestern that was played in a driving rainstorm that
turned Ryan Field into a swamp:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of fun. It probably was one of most fun games I've
ever played in. It's fun to get down in the mud and slide around
and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, on his decision to run a reverse on
third-and-12 and the resulting 38-yard gain that helped set up his
team's game-winning field goal against LSU:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't consider it a gamble. A lot of people said it was,
after the game, but who knows what sportswriters are going to say.
They know so little about the game.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Northwestern and Ohio State tied for first place
in the Big Ten Conference. This year, the Wildcats are 0-4 in the
Big Ten going into today's game with the top-ranked Buckeyes. If
Northwestern finishes last, it will become the first Big Ten team
in 38 years (Wisconsin, 1960) to go from the top to the bottom in a
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1992, Florida
State is 7-0 against Clemson. With last Saturday's 48-0 defeat of
the Tigers, the Seminoles have outscored Clemson 156-3 in four
victories in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Temple, Rutgers and Northern Illinois all won on
the same day for the first time since Sept. 22, 1989. For Temple
and Rutgers, it was the first time both won Big East Conference
games on the same day since the league was formed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's 14-7 defeat of Iowa was historic. It marked the first
time in the Big Ten that a team lost to an opponent by 60 or more
points one season and then beat that opponent the next season. Iowa
won, 62-0, last season. Perfect records
</P>
<P>
   When the Bowl Championship Series rankings debut Monday, one of
the factors in the formula will be strength of schedule. Here's a
look at the eight undefeated teams and the won-loss records of the
teams they have defeated and the teams they have yet to play:
/Past/Future Team (W-L)/Opp. W-L/Pct./Opp. W-L/Pct. Arkansas
(6-0)/14-25/.359/18-11/.621 Kansas State
(6-0)/18-19/.486/17-15/.531 Marshall (7-0)/21-29/.420/8-17/.320
Ohio State (6-0)/23-14/.622/15-17/.469 Tennessee
(5-0)/17-14/.548/18-20/.474 Tulane (5-0)/10-22/.312/12-26/.316 UCLA

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The man Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
wanted to take home with him this weekend is disgraced in the
United States but a hero to many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollard sits in a federal prison in Butner, N.C.,
serving the 12th year of a life sentence for turning over
high-level U.S. Navy secrets to the Israeli intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Israeli officials disavowed him and even helped the United
States in his prosecution. Friday, they were willing to delay and
almost scuttle the planned signing of an important peace agreement
to free him.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic deadlock was diffused, as President Bill Clinton
agreed to review Pollard's case in consideration of a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That review will be done without any commitments. There is no
time limit'' for completing it, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The move has been sought by Netanyahu but would likely face
stiff opposition from U.S. intelligence and defense officials.
</P>
<P>
   It will also set off a round of soul-searching about
U.S.-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, 44, is a Jewish-American who went to work as an
intelligence analyst for the Navy's highly-sensitive anti-terrorism
alert center in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, an Israeli businessman introduced Pollard to an Israeli
air force colonel. Pollard told him he was disturbed that Israel
was not getting all the information it should from U.S.
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government set out to recruit Pollard to cull secret
documents from the Navy. They flew him to Paris, gave him $10,000
and, eventually, a $1,500 monthly salary.
</P>
<P>
   The loads of documents Pollard delivered reportedly covered
mostly information the United States had gathered on Arab nations,
but some were nations the U.S. considered friendly and did not want
to betray by informing on them to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After Pollard was arrested, Israeli officials, in what some
describe as great embarrassment, turned over the information
Pollard had given them. He pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin asked for clemency for
Pollard, but Netanyahu's administration has been the first to
officially acknowledge that Pollard was a spy for Israel. He and
his aides have been consistently pushing for his release, while
Pollard's second wife Esther, a Canadian Orthodox Jew, keeps up a
steady campaign; a campaign that has caught on especially with
Israel's right-wing and religious interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as Oct. 1, Clinton rejected a request from
Netanyahu that Pollard be freed. Presidents Reagan and Bush also
had refused Israeli appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Melman, an expert on Israeli intelligence, said
Netanyahu's last-minute hold out appeared to be in search of
something that could impress Israelis, fatigued by the repeated
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Netanyahu comes and says, 'I have a great achievement
by being stubborn and insisting that I improve the security element
of this deal,' the Israeli public would shrug,'' Melman said.
``It's more easy to sell to the public 'Here, I'm bringing with me
a spy who was rotting for 12 years in a jail.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Netanyahu's former allies now oppose him for making the
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis see Pollard, who was given Israeli citizenship, as
someone who was looking out for their security and, somewhat like a
soldier in battle, should not be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters note that he was spying for a U.S. ally and should
not face a life sentence. Detractors, including many in the top
echelons of the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, say
Pollard endangered American security. Even Clinton has decried,
``the enormity of Mr. Pollard's offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, the Pollard negotiations wiped the focus off
the overall peace agreement on Israeli news shows. The topic
combines three great Israeli spectator sports -- politics, peace
talks and espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so shameful and embarrassing to the entire country what
he did with Pollard. It throws a cloud over the whole agreement,''
Israeli parliament member and Netanyahu opponent Yossi Beilin told
Israeli television.

ERIC AMBLER, 89, SPY NOVELIST WHO RAISED GENRE TO LEVEL OF
LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Ambler, whose name is synonymous with novels of suspense,
action, adventure and intrigue in foreign lands and whose books
became models for generations of other writers, died Oct. 22 at his
home in London. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Ambler, a worldly Englishman, is generally credited with having
raised the thriller to the level of literature. He brought
intellectual substance to the genre at a time when it often
suffered from shortages of surprise, maturity, verisimilitude and
literary skill. He did that by writing a half-dozen eloquent novels
that were published, and widely applauded, between 1936 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Those books, set mostly in Europe, painted haunting panoramas of
intrigue and villainy. They were also distinguished by credible
heroes, realistic settings and vivid evocations of the nervous,
politically-charged years that led to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His early feat still fascinates literary historians. Peter Lewis
of the University of Durham in England wrote in a 1990 book:
``Ambler raised the thriller from the subliterary depths, showing
that the genre and good prose were not incompatible, and redeeming
its conventions for more serious purposes than the display of macho
derring-do. Virtually single-handedly, he redefined the thriller so
as to make possible the achievement of such postwar realists as
John le Carre and Len Deighton.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham Greene praised him as ``the greatest living writer of the
novel of suspense'' and called himself one of Ambler's disciples.
Le Carre, who is 22 years younger than Ambler and is best known for
his espionage novel ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' called
Ambler's novels ``the well into which everybody had dipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler's work has withstood the test of time. Julian Evans,
writing in The Guardian in 1997, called him ``the begetter of the
modern thriller'' and praised the early Ambler novels for mirroring
``the queasy atmosphere and conspiratorial politics'' of 1930s
Europe. Julian Symons, the British crime novelist and critic, wrote
in 1994 that Ambler belonged to the breed of thriller writers ``who
charm us by the elegance of their prose and their subtlety in
dealing with places and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler was a fantasy-prone advertising man when he began writing
his suspense novels in the 1930s. He was a slender figure then,
with pale blue eyes that have been called hooded and with, as he
wrote later in a self-mocking moment, ``such a sensitive face.''
</P>
<P>
   His books were innovative, as the young author cocksurely meant
them to be. ``Dorothy Sayers had taken the detective story and made
it literate,'' he once said. ``Why shouldn't I do the same with
spies?''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler's heroes were generally more ordinary and believable than
those of novels of their type written in the preceding years. Their
technological knowledge was certainly more authoritative, and the
worlds through which these heroes moved were depicted in a more
realistic and gritty way.
</P>
<P>
   He made his name with ``A Coffin for Dimitrios'' and his five
other earliest novels, ``The Dark Frontier,'' ``Background to
Danger,'' ``Cause for Alarm,'' ``Epitaph for a Spy'' and ``Journey
into Fear.'' All six were published between 1936 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coffin for Dimitrios'' is about a British writer of
detective fiction who becomes involved with a Turkish underworld
figure called Dimitrios. A classic political thriller, it was a
Book-of-the-Month Club selection in September 1939, when Germany
invaded Poland, touching off World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Penzler, an American expert on mystery fiction and
thrillers who owns the two Mysterious Bookshops, in New York City
and Los Angeles, has said the book is ``one of the milestones of
espionage fiction and brought it truly and irrevocably into the
modern era.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Coffin for Dimitrios'' has even been called prophetic.
Robert D. Kaplan, the author of ``Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through
History,'' wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1993, that
for fun, ``and not a little insight into the chaos and anarchy now
being unleashed in the Balkans,'' readers should ``turn to `Coffin
for Dimitrios.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan added: ``Here is a tale of drug smuggling, assassination
and political intrigue, set in the early part of the century, that
perfectly captures the atmosphere at the end of the century, as
political crime networks make their return not just to Bucharest,
but even more so to Belgrade and other former communist capitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's appeal to Americans has proven so durable that in
1996 _ six decades after it first came out _ a new edition was
published by the New York publishers Carroll &AMP; Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Ambler's thrillers that proved prophetic was ``The
Dark Frontier,'' which he wrote in 1935. It begins in Britain,
shifts to Europe and proceeds in Ixania, a fictional Balkan state.
It has to do with nuclear weaponry, and Ambler, writing about the
book decades later, said, ``What, it may be asked, was I doing in
those far-off days using the term `atomic bomb' so familiarly and
describing the effects of an atomic explosion as if the hideous
thing already existed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay no claim to special prescience,'' he continued. As a
student he had read about science, and he recalled that he had come
to know about the early work of Ernest Rutherford, the British
physicist who studied atoms, and of other scientists in the field,
and that he had come to understand some of its implications.
</P>
<P>
   Among Ambler's other books are ``Judgment on Deltchev'' (1951),
``The Schirmer Inheritance'' (1953), ``State of Siege'' (1956),
``Passage of Arms'' (1960), ``A Kind of Anger'' (1964), ``The
Intercom Conspiracy'' (1969), ``The Levanter'' (1982) and ``Doctor
Frigo'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his novels, he wrote or collaborated on more than
a dozen screenplays in Britain and Hollywood between the end of
World War II and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated for an Academy Award for his script for ``The
Cruel Sea'' (1953), and movies were made _ though not not by him _
from several of his books, including ``The Light of Day,'' which
became the successful Jules Dassin film ``Topkapi'' with Peter
Ustinov and Melina Mercouri in 1964; ``A Coffin for Dimitrios,''
which was made into the 1944 movie ``The Mask of Dimitrios'' with
Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, and ``Journey Into Fear,''
which became a 1942 film, under the same title, with Orson Welles
as Colonel Haki of the Turkish secret police, one of Ambler's most
memorable characters.

Pollard's second wife Esther, a Canadian Orthodox Jew, keeps up a
steady campaign; a campaign that has caught on especially with
Israel's right-wing and religious interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as Oct. 1, Clinton rejected a request from
Netanyahu that Pollard be freed. Presidents Reagan and Bush also
had refused Israeli appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Melman, an expert on Israeli intelligence, said
Netanyahu's last-minute hold out appeared to be in search of
something that could impress Israelis, fatigued by the repeated
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Netanyahu comes and says, 'I have a great achievement
by being stubborn and insisting that I improve the security element
of this deal,' the Israeli public would shrug,'' Melman said.
``It's more easy to sell to the public 'Here, I'm bringing with me
a spy who was rotting for 12 years in a jail.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Netanyahu's former allies now oppose him for making the
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis see Pollard, who was given Israeli citizenship, as
someone who was looking out for their security and, somewhat like a
soldier in battle, should not be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters note that he was spying for a U.S. ally and should
not face a life sentence. Detractors, including many in the top
echelons of the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, say
Pollard endangered American security. Even Clinton has decried,
``the enormity of Mr. Pollard's offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, the Pollard negotiations wiped the focus off
the overall peace agreement on Israeli news shows. The topic
combines three great Israeli spectator sports -- politics, peace
talks and espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so shameful and embarrassing to the entire country what
he did with Pollard. It throws a cloud over the whole agreement,''
Israeli parliament member and Netanyahu opponent Yossi Beilin told
Israeli television.

 UNDATED: memorable characters.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Ambler was born on June 28, 1909, in London, the son of
Alfred Percy Ambler and Amy Madeleine Ambler. His father's many
metiers ranged from church organist to music hall performer to
publicist and brewery employee.
</P>
<P>
   Young Eric went to Colfe's Grammar School in London, studied
engineering at London University, found it dull, and left in 1927
without a degree. Then came a stint with an electrical-equipment
company, a disappointing stab at show business, early, nonlucrative
writing of fiction and plays, and some years in advertising, where
he began as a copywriter and did well before turning full time to
the writing of thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   When Ambler was still a London advertising man in 1934 he had an
odd formative experience. While on a vacation in Marseilles, he was
cheated out of money playing poker-dice with a larcenous bartender
and then fantasized about murdering the man with a rifle at a
street crossing in the city. At that same spot, later that year, a
Croatian assassin shot and killed King Alexander of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That coincidence spurred Ambler's imagination. In an interview
half a century later, he recalled: `I felt I had a fresh bit of my
character, which was an assassin. And I felt there were people all
over Europe just like me, just ready for the word to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Here Lies: An Autobiography,'' which came out in
Britain in 1985, he wrote that he had cut out news pictures of the
site of both the bartender's imagined death and the king's actual
demise. ``I felt oddly guilty, but also pleased,'' he added. ``In
the Mediterranean sunshine there were strange and violent men with
whom I could identify, and with whom, in a way, I was now in
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Ambler recalled in ``Here Lies,'' ``the only
kind of popular novel about which I had strong feelings'' around
that time ``was the post-war thriller'' _ that is, the thriller as
it had been being written since the end of World War I. ``I could
no longer find any worth a second reading,'' he complained. He felt
that the villains were unbelievable _ ``power-crazed or coldly
sane, I no longer believed a word of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for Ambler, ``The hero did not seem to matter much. He
was often only a fugitive, a hare to the villain's hounds. He could
be a tweedy fellow with steel-gray eyes and gun pads on both
shoulders or a moneyed dandy with a taste for adventure. None of
that really mattered.'' Pre-Ambler thrillers of that era have also
been criticized as lacking a political and atmospheric sense of
Europe and of the looming prospect of another war.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I saw it, the thriller had nowhere to go but up,'' Ambler
recalled in ``Here Lies.'' ``I set out to start the upward trend.''
He wrote ``The Dark Frontier,'' which got favorable reviews but had
many faults, he felt. He told a friend, Eileen Bigland, who was a
serious author, that he had been reading Gogol, Pirandello and
James Joyce. She said: ``Never read very good writers when you are
trying yourself to write good trash. You'll only get depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler turned out to be immensely skilled at depicting heroes
who were unremarkable but appealing people enmeshed in sinister
situations. As Penzler put it, ``Average people behaving bravely,
albeit through no desire of their own, as events threaten and
engulf them is the hallmark of Ambler's thrillers.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Guardian in 1972, describing the basic plot that Ambler
evolved in reshaping the thriller, Thomas Wiseman wrote: ``The
villain will be as colorful as the hero is colorless, he will be
gross and excessive, with extreme appetites of one sort or another,
while the hero or narrator will tend to be abstemious, reserved,
unused to firearms or women, physically weak, but possessing a
native shrewdness, and some special knowledge that in the end turns
the tables on his most powerful adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler drew on his early training in engineering, and he made
engineers the heroes of five of his novels: ``Cause for Alarm,''
Journey into Fear,'' ``State of Siege,'' ``Passage of Arms'' and
``The Levanter.'' It also helped him to write believably about
technical matters.
</P>
<P>
   His vivid characters include Arthur Abdel Simpson, who has been
called the half-hero of Ambler's novels ``The Light of Day'' and
``Dirty Story'' (1967). He is a part-time journalist, minor thief
and confidence man who says things like ``I have only really been
arrested 10 or 12 times in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Ambler's nonheroes are Professor Krom in ``The Siege of
the Villa Lipp'' (1977), who says, ``What use is an honest lawyer
when what you need is a dishonest one?'' and Colonel Haki, who, on
arriving at a house party in a Turkish villa early in ``A Coffin
for Dimitrios,'' ``clicked heels, kissed hands, bowed, acknowledged
the salutes of the naval officers and ogled the businessmen's
wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Salted with such figures, the plot of at least one Ambler novel
has inspired imitation in real life. As Jay Pearsall, owner of the
two Murder Ink bookstores in New York City, has written, ``After
seeing `Topkapi' (1964), a film based on Eric Ambler's `The Light
of Day' (1962), Jack Murphy (aka Murf the Surf) stole the world's
largest star sapphire, the Star of India, from New York's Museum of
Natural History.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Ambler served in the British army, spent
much of the time helping to make training and educational films for
army use and wrote no novels. Soon after the war, Noel Coward urged
him to resume his novel writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The admonitory Coward index finger wagged under my nose,''
Ambler recalled in ``Here Lies.'' ```Forget all this film
nonsense,' he said. `Write more books. You think that you will
always be able to go back to the well. But if you stay away too
long, there will come a day when you will go back and find the well
drr-y.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ambler collaborated with an Australian writer, Charles Rodda, on
some thrillers that were published under the pseudonym Eliot Reed
between 1950 and 1958. But Ambler wrote later that he had only
contributed substantially to the first two of the five thrillers
that came out under the Reed pseudonym (``Skytip'' and ``Tender to
Danger'').
</P>
<P>
   Ambler's first novel written under his own name after the war,
``Judgment on Deltchev,'' came out in 1951 and followed a British
playwright sent to a Balkan city to report about a treason trial
for a newspaper, who then acquires dangerous knowledge. ``The
Schirmer Inheritance,'' in which a well-born American lawyer hunted
in early post-war Europe for the heir to an American fortune,
followed.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 30 years he wrote 10 more novels. In this
second, postwar phase of his career, he repeatedly turned to Third
World settings involving volatile politics, international
megacompanies and other forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of Arms'' takes place in Asia and involves the finding
of a hidden store of guerrilla weapons; James M. Cain said it was
``tops for its picture of Southeast Asia, in all its color and
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Intercom Conspiracy,'' published in 1969, is set mainly in
Switzerland, where Ambler lived for some years, and is about two
espionage agents working for minor NATO nations. In the early
1970s, he wrote ``The Levanter,'' which involves plotting by
Palestinians against Israel. That book was followed by ``Doctor
Frigo,'' in which plotters tried to take power in a Caribbean
island. Admirers of his last published novel, ``The Care of Time''
(1981), point to its inviting start: ``The warning message arrived
on Monday, the bomb itself on Wednesday. It became a busy week.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the Mystery Writers of America gave Ambler its Grand
Master Award. In 1981, Queen Elizabeth II made him an Officer of
the Order of the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Ambler's 1939 marriage to Louise Crombie, to whom he dedicated
``Journey into Fear,'' ended in divorce in May 1958. His second
wife was Joan Harrison, a screenwriter and film and television
producer. She helped write the scripts for ``Foreign
Correspondent,'' ``Rebecca'' and other films directed by Alfred
Hitchcock, and she produced the television series ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents'' from 1955 to 1962. She died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ambler left no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thrillers are respectable now,'' Ambler said in a 1981
interview with Herbert Mitgang of The New York Times. ``Back in the
beginning, people weren't quite that sure about them,'' but ``they
really say more about the way people think and governments behave
than many of the conventional novels. A hundred years from now, if
they last, these books may offer some clues to what was going on in
our world.''

NINE QUESTIONS ABOUT AN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine questions about the election nine days away:
</P>
<P>
   1. Which way is the tide running? There is the potential
building nationally for a late Democratic surge that should
diminish the gains the GOP expected in congressional races. Part of
it is voter disgust with the GOP effort to impeach Clinton. Part of
it may be fear about a looming recession.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the GOP ticket of Cellucci-Swift appears
stalled, and momentum may be shifting to the Harshbarger-Tolman
team. The governor's race is tight as a tick. But the gravitational
pull of the heavy Democratic edge in voter ID could counteract Paul
Cellucci's edge with incumbency and a 3-2 advantage in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Menino, no slouch at grass-roots politicking, sees
``young women with baby carriages, soccer moms and waitress moms''
at Harshbarger events. ``They seem to want a Democrat,'' says
Menino. Harshbarger and Cellucci teeter on the knife-edge of a
single-digit outcome, conceivably closer than the 3 percent margin
that ushered in the GOP era eight years ago when Bill Weld defeated
John Silber. Had 38,000-plus of 2,275,000 voters in '90 switched,
Silber would have won.
</P>
<P>
   2. Will Monday's debate be pivotal? Possibly; a disastrous turn
by either man would hurt mightily when the candidates are
neck-and-neck approaching the wire. But the climactic Weld-Silber
debate of '90 didn't seem to determine the winner. Strength on the
ground, get-out-the-vote machinery, cash-on-hand for last-minute TV
spots, and the centrifugal force of the economy or party
affiliation might eclipse a debate standoff.
</P>
<P>
   3. Is there anything under the Cellucci-Swift ticket that could
counteract the Democrats' edge in registration? Nothing that is
readily apparent. The Weld factor has run its course. There is no
GOP candidate statewide or at the congressional level who is
favored or ahead in any published polls. The Republicans are not
even running seriously for most legislative seats. And Republicans
appointed to elective office in hopes they could hold on as
incumbents are threatened. If Cellucci is tipped, it could be
another epochal wipeout for the GOP here.
</P>
<P>
   4. Why are Republicans not any stronger down the ticket after
eight years of Weld-Cellucci? Perhaps the strong economy diverted
ambitious Republicans into more lucrative private-sector pursuits.
Example: Bob Maginn, a 41-year-old neophyte who's been a Bain &AMP; Co.
senior partner, now wants to be state treasurer. He chucked
$350,000 of his own into his race against Shannon O'Brien, the
Democratic front-runner. O'Brien, 39, is a graduate of Yale, BU Law
School, has four terms in the Massachusetts House and Senate, is
daughter of an executive councilor from western Mass., and has been
for four years a health care executive.
</P>
<P>
   5. So why is O'Brien far out in front? Few voters know who
Maginn is. He has a raft of notions, to begin a new Lottery game to
pay for higher-salaried teachers, dole out college scholarships to
random winners, change the way state pension funds are invested,
and build on gains made under Treasurer Joe Malone. Maginn said in
an interview, ``I've seen what happens to business people who try
to run. They generally lose, even if they spend a lot of money.''
He referred to people like Republicans Ray Shamie and Mitt Romnney,
his fellow Bain &AMP; Co. consultant, or Democrat Chris Gabrieli, who
tossed several million of his own money into the 8th Congressional
District fight in which the brainy venture capitalist finished
sixth out of 10 with 7 percent of the vote, with a total of 5,264
votes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Why don't business successes translate into vote-getting
appeal? Maginn paints O'Brien as an unqualified insider; he says he
has more professional money-managing skills. But she raises doubts
about Maginn by pointing out he has refused to disclose his tax
return, as she did. And she presses him to reveal the names of
clients for whom he worked. He demurs, claiming he filed all
required ethics forms, and says rules at the secretive Bain &AMP; Co.
bar him from discussing clients. So debate stalls as the clock runs
out.
</P>
<P>
   7. Is there a Republican incumbent in danger of getting swept
out if there is a Democratic tide? More than one, but a shining
example would be Norfolk County district attorney. Jeff Locke is
young but seasoned, a Weld appointtee who meshed easily with the
prosecutorial staff he inherited from Bill Delahunt. But Locke
faces an uphill struggle against state Senator Bill Keating, a
polished Democrat from Sharon whose political credentials are as
long as Locke's prosecutorial hashmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Locke is anti-death penalty, which should help in liberal
Brookline. He hails from a strong political bloodline, earned the
respect of law enforcement as a straight shooter. But Keating won a
three-way primary easily, campaigns with the sure hand of a
practiced politico, and has a county-wide grass-roots network that
will be difficult for Locke to overcome. Locke's plight is typical
of the built-in bias against emerging Republican contenders in this
state. You can have the governor's office behind you, an impressive
record of bipartisan cooperation in the DA's office, which is
ususally the least-politicized of our state's elected offices, and
you can enjoy easy access to media coverage. But that ``R'' is a
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   8. Is there a hidden issue waiting to be exploited? My hunch is
that it is the heightened fears of elderly and ailing voters that
recent and sudden cracks in the medical safety net might pitch them
into financial ruin. Changes in Medicare and Medicaid and sweeping
cutbacks by HMOs and insurance companies leave many even
middle-class retirees apprehensive. The unexpected disappearance of
previously-paid-for prescription drugs and home health care has
unsettled a legion of seniors. Scott Harshbarger said Friday,
``There's a real panic out there'' about medical coverage cutbacks,
which he is addressing.
</P>
<P>
   9. Where's Weld-o? That's a puzzler worthy of Click &AMP; Clack. The
ex-guv's been all over the place promoting his crime novel and his
law firm. For some reason, he's not been visible in the Cellucci
effort, either in person or on TV. Why no Mystery Writers for
Cellucci spot? Hmmm. I haven't a clue.

MEXICAN-AMERICANS WRESTLE WITH IDENTITY, ALLEGIANCES  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Roaming the streets of the one of the largest
cities in the world, one can look to the northern sky and see the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans lament what their capital has become, a slow-grinding,
traffic-jammed, crime-ridden metropolis that bears more resemblance
to Los Angeles than to the rest of Latin America. Too many people
from the countryside and small towns are moving into the city
looking for work and finding too few jobs awaiting them. The
population of Mexico City now approaches 25 million and represents
nearly a third of the entire population of Mexico. The city is
changing, people say, and changing, along with it, the country that
surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, is changing the United States. If immigration
from Mexico and Latin America continues at the current rate and
birthrates remain steady, Hispanics will, by the year 2050, make up
25 percent of the U.S. population. If the current proportion among
that diverse community holds firm, a full two-thirds of them will
be Mexican or Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   That means that to the extent the 21st Century can be called, as
some suggest, the ``Hispanic Century,'' it will largely be the
``Mexican Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years from now, Americans in Des Moines or Cheyenne will
know what those in Phoenix or Tucson already know - that the
economic, political and sociological fate of America is hopelessly
tied to that of the nearly 90 million Mexicans living to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have glimpsed that future and trembled. Watching
their hometowns change before their eyes amid a sea of taco trucks
and Mexican-flag-waving soccer fans, some are convinced that they
are witnessing a cultural takeover _ one being helped along by an
ememy within.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-immigration organizations, including the Southern
California-based Voices of Citizens Together, have been warning
that the Southwest is being slowly invaded by an advancing army of
Mexican immigrants. In its literature and on its Web site, VCT
refers to the invaders as ``reconquistas,'' intent on reconquering
the Southwest, which belonged to Mexico until the Mexican War of
1846.
</P>
<P>
   VCT charges that the avenging invaders are being aided and
abetted by the millions of Mexican-Americans living in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's paranoid fantasy. The reality of both the
historical and present-day relationship between those who dwell in
the Mexican homeland and the 20 million Mexican-Americans,
including the nearly 1 million living in Arizona, is much more
complicated, as a new private foundation attempting to link the two
is now realizing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican and American Solidarity Foundation, founded in 1994
and based in both Washington, D.C., and Mexico City, is an
idealistic peace summit of sorts. It seeks to better relations but
also, in a sense, to chase away ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   By taking small delegations of Mexican-American leaders to
Mexico City for a weeklong barrage of seminars, panel discussions
and visits to schools, poverty pockets and various small towns, the
foundation attempts to ``strengthen and promote the cultural,
educational, and economic ties uniting Mexico and Mexican-Americans
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the conspiracy theorists believe, that's no easy
task. Mexican-American and Mexicans may share the same blood lines,
surnames, complexion and religion. They may even, to varying
degrees, speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they remain two distinct groups, influenced as much by the
passage of time as by the maintenance of a common heritage. They
are, in a sense, relatives _ but only of the most distant variety.
Far from united, they're separated by pride and by memory.
</P>
<P>
   Any Mexican-American stepping onto Mexican soil realizes two
things immediately. One is that there is no escape from memory.
There is no eluding the fact that Papa or Grandpa or Great-Grandpa
came from here - came from Mexican states, the names of which have
been passed along at family gatherings in the United States for
generations. Sonora. Nuevo Leon. Zacatecas. In the case of my own
Mexican grandfather, Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   The other is that Papa or Grandpa or Great-Grandpa left Mexico
for good reason. They were pushed out by economic depression, by
war or by a perennially corrupt political system that has always
treated the ruling elite extraordinarily well while tolerating the
exploitation of millions of their impoverished countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Mexican-Americans are made to choose almost
instantly - not between the United States and Mexico, but between
Mexico and the history of their own family.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, they choose their family. And so, while there is
familiarity, there is no loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Further straining the relationship is that the Mexican
government has chosen a familiar but dangerous strategy for
deflecting criticism. With unrest brewing in both Mexico City,
which is now controlled by the opposition party, and among
indigenous rebels in the southern state of Chiapas, the ruling PRI
has resurrected an old strategy of blaming the United States for
Mexico's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of argument would be marginally credible if it were
based on either the historical relationship between the two
countries or even their modern economic interdependence. However,
that's not the card that the PRI has chosen to play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has seized upon, of all things, the issue of Mexican
immigration to the United States. By charging that the United
States is abusing, exploiting and mistreating those millions of
Mexican citizens who enter along our southern border - most of whom
have worried families still living in Mexico - the government and
some elements of the Mexican press perpetuate the notion that
Mexicans should be at least as worried, if not more, about what
happens in the American political system as in their own.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Mexicans' paranoia, not unlike the paranoia of
U.S. anti-immigration groups, is fueled by actual political
developments and a changing reality in the American Southwest. They
include highly publicized immigration crackdowns in states like
California, experiments with stationing U.S. troops along the
border and efforts to strengthen the presence of the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   However, the main intent of the strategy is to throw off
attention from PRI-orchestrated abuses. One obvious effect is that
Mexican-Americans are made to choose sides. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Americans living in the United States might be reassured to know
that whenever this troublesome subject emerged during the
Solidarity Foundation seminar - and it did so repeatedly - the
common sense and loyalty of the Mexican-American participants
remained unshaken. The visitors continually argued with their
government hosts, challenging the PRI's weakening hold on the
Mexican people while defending the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Proof once again that the idea of ``America'' - the beacon that
called to one generation and under which successive ones have
prospered and thrived - is simply too powerful a concept for
immigrants from any country to resist. Never really threatened with
cultural takeovers or conspiracies, it irrevocably changes all it
touches and, through that process, fortifies its influence on
dissidents, revolutionaries and other restless spirits throughout
the world. &QL;

CRITICS SEE GLENN'S FLIGHT AS AGE-OLD PUBLIC RELATIONS STUNT

By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As NASA finishes preparations for the most closely watched
mission since the first moon landing in 1969, a lively debate
continues about why a 77-year-old man is being sent back into
space.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Glenn says the journey, coming 36 years after he
became the first American to orbit the Earth, is all about
scientific research to aid the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But others, both within the space agency and those who closely
follow its workings, see other motives.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics believe the mission is little more than the
proverbial ``gold watch'' for a retiring lawmaker and American
hero, or dismiss it as a public relations ploy in a time of
shrinking budgets.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it's some of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs heroes,'' NASA administrator Dan Goldin said
earlier this month at a Rice University lecture. ``When I said to
Sen. Glenn, `You're going to space to do research but also as an
American hero who deserves a second flight.' He bristled at me a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he's going to space to do science,'' added Goldin,
who approved Glenn's flight last January. ``He's also going to
space to say America is a land of explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said, ``If you eliminate the science benefits, there is no
reason (for me to go) except that I want to go again. But that is
not a justification for sending someone. Lots of people would like
to go. We are going for science.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will become the oldest human to travel in space if the
shuttle Discovery and its crew of six others blasts off as
scheduled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 300,000 tourists are expected to line the roadways
and beaches near the launch pad to watch liftoff, and the 3,500
media credential requests exceed any previous mission.
</P>
<P>
   As one rationale for his flight, Glenn proposed that he serve as
a research subject in experiments that will look for a link between
the natural aging process and the effects of spaceflight on the
body's muscle, skeletal, immune and cardiovascular systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a stunt,'' claims Alex Roland, who chairs the Duke
University history department and once chronicled space development
for NASA. ``There is no substance to it whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain level it's sort of charming _ if you take this at
its most innocent level. He's a magnificent physical specimen. He's
kept up with his training, so it is at a very low cost to the
taxpayer,'' said Roland. ``Isn't it marvelous this old codger would
even want to do this, and secondly that he is physically capable of
doing it, and hooray for old people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that level it does have a lot of public interest. But you
do have to ask yourself if there is more going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   By NASA's own design, Discovery's nine-day flight is a
hodge-podge of almost everything its shuttle can do in space:
deploy and retrieve satellites and serve as a laboratory for a
phenomenally range of experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will serve as a subject in two major medical experiments.
One will require at least a dozen blood draws and regular urine
sample collections to reveal the way his body metabolizes the
proteins that form his musculature.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts lose significant amounts of muscle and bone mass
while they are weightless, a major impediment to a lengthy voyage
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly experience similar gradual declines on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts reverse the muscle and bone mass loss after they
return to Earth's gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's second major experiment will study his sleep patterns.
Young astronauts, like many elderly, have difficulty sleeping. The
loss of sleep degrades their waking performance.
</P>
<P>
   The sleep experiment will require Glenn to don a sleep cap with
electrodes to monitor his heart rate, respiration and movement.
Every two to three days, Glenn will also be required to swallow a
large, cold-pill sized electronic device, equipped with a
thermometer and a tiny radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The pill will monitor Glenn's core body temperature and transmit
the results to a portable receiver recorder strapped to his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASA disclosed Glenn had been quietly dropped from
another facet of the experiment that would have required him to
take either a pill containing a small amount of the hormone
melatonin or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a gland in the brain, melatonin is considered a
natural sleep remedy, one that could help weary astronauts and
possibly the elderly obtain the rest they need. Neither Glenn nor
NASA would disclose why he was removed from that experiment.
</P>
<P>
   He will, however, continue to participate in post-sleep surveys
of his performance, which will be conducted with a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will also join his crewmates in eight other experiments
that have been conducted on previous shuttle astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Those will monitor cardiovascular activity, changes in his
body's ability to ward off illness and adjustments in the way his
nervous system maintains balance, both in space and immediately
upon his return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Williams, the physician-astronaut who directs NASA's
life science research, said Glenn's availability for spaceflight
offered experimenters an unusual but worthwhile opportunity. There
are no plans to fly other elderly astronauts for at least several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Glenn is serving as sort of a medical lighthouse,
someone whose experiences will serve to point the way for future
research inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing statistically controlled trials,'' Williams
said. ``We are doing experiments that will allow us to make
important observations and to understand very important
physiological processes that can go on to be tested in other
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the statistical significance of a lone contribution
to medical research on the elderly in space is one Glenn addresses
grudging, and his impressive professional resume indicates why.
</P>
<P>
   ``My flight back in 1962 was one flight,'' he notes. ``Was this
statistically significant or not? Should we have gone ahead?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one flight and didn't prove anything, just that we
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn circled the Earth three times on Feb. 20, 1962, U.S.
medical experts debated whether his vision would be so distorted by
the absence of gravity that he could not see his control panel,
whether he would choke on his saliva and whether he would be able
to hold down food.
</P>
<P>
   Without the assurances Glenn provided that those would not be
problems, it would have been impossible to send U.S. explorers to
the moon. &QL;

GOP CONGRESS DIDN'T DELIVER ON ITS FISCAL PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The budget just approved by Congress proves there's
not a dime's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pigs who could be offended by this,'' Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri said of the $520 billion Senate spending
package. The same could have been said of the 4,000-page House
bill, which weighed 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be like this. When the Republicans gained
a majority in both chambers of Congress for the first time in more
than a generation, conventional wisdom anticipated a dramatic shift
toward stricter fiscal discipline, tax relief accompanied by a more
efficient and user-friendly Internal Revenue Code, and serious
efforts to limit the federal government's reach and growth.
</P>
<P>
   None of which has come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the GOP this year presided over a budget process that
favored the International Monetary Fund over America's taxpayers,
deferred obsequiously to the spending wishes of an administration
weakened by scandal, and turned on the spending spigots in the best
tax-and-spend tradition of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hodge, a senior fellow with Citizens for a Sound Economy,
noted that the spending boosts contained in the first three budgets
of the GOP-controlled Congress amounted to 16 percent more than the
spending increases of the previous three budgets ramrodded by the
Democrats. Meanwhile, Hodge pointed out, domestic discretionary
spending is now higher on an inflation-adjusted basis than it was
during the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   There are, no doubt, many conservatives licking their chops at
the prospect of an Election Day GOP rout that will result in a
veto-proof Congress. Those yearning for smaller government,
spending restraint, tax relief, and more responsible stewardship of
Social Security and Medicare should be careful what they pray for.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what has happened during the last year, there is no
reason hard-working, taxpaying Americans can expect a better shake
from Republicans than from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any year the GOP majority had it within its power
to do the right thing, 1998 was the year. Tax receipts grew by
about 10 percent, which made it possible to claim the largest
budget surplus in U.S. history. The revenue growth was about triple
the pace of economic growth, and it was almost all real growth
because inflation was negligible.
</P>
<P>
   A modest tax reform package based on reduced marginal rates
should have been a slam dunk. It also would have been the right
thing to do because taxpayer generosity made Washington's bulging
coffers possible. It wasn't a slam dunk, though, because the GOP
chose to react defensively to President Clinton's clever
designation of the budget surplus as the instrument to ``save''
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   What everyone was loath to admit, though, was that Social
Security didn't need saving. It is, in fact, swimming in money. Its
excess revenue made the budget surplus possible in the first place.
Moreover, the surplus can't be saved, because there is no legal way
for the Treasury to transform it into assets with market value.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats understand this, which explains the
last-minute spending spree that will consume about one-third of the
putative budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Not that how it's spent makes any difference. It's always
business as usual in Washington, regardless of who's in charge, and
that business is taxing and spending.

IF THE ROCK SUPPORTED BEAM FOR 98 YEARS, IT SHOULD SUPPORT LOLLY
COLUMNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The main beam in my 1900 house has old cedar posts under it,
and are getting somewhat punky. I plan to replace them with lolly
columns. The old posts were sitting on the biggest rock possible in
my basement. Can the lolly columns sit on the rock where the posts
were, or do they need their own footing?
</P>
<P>
   JIM HOLLAND, Dedham
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the posts sat on the rock for 98 years, and the beam did
not move, there is no good reason not to use the rock as a base for
the new columns. Make sure the rock is flat where you put the
columns so they won't skid around. If there were some posts set on
earth instead of rock, then you have to build a footing for the new
ones. A concrete footing (one for each post) should be 12 inches
deep and 24 inches square.
</P>
<P>
   Since the rock may make the distance between it and the beam
different in different locations, you might be better off using
screw jacks, which are adjustable, rather than lolly columns, which
have to be cut to fit. Generally, codes require that the screw jack
mechanism be welded to make sure it will stay put.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a fine old sideboard with many doors and drawers. It
has a horrendous odor of mothballs. How can I get rid of that odor?
</P>
<P>
   SANDY BLINN, Andover
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There's a pretty strong mothball smell in two drawers of an
old chest. How can I get rid of that odor?
</P>
<P>
   STUART MONROE, Hudson
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two questions within a month make it appropriate to answer. I
imagine there are other people with the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   So, for starters, ventilate those drawers or the whole piece, by
placing them outdoors on a dry, sunny day. This will help somewhat,
but the odor is likely to come back when the piece is brought
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Next, sand all bare wood, including the inside of the piece as
well as the inside and outside of all drawers. This will take the
very top of the wood off, and some of the odor.
</P>
<P>
   If not all the odor, wet all bare wood surfaces with water, and
sprinkle baking soda heavily on all wet surfaces. If this makes a
difference, repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible ``cure:'' Natural Magic Odor Blaster, a
deodorizer that oxidizes the source rather than covering it up or
paralyzing the smeller (you and me). It is sold in hardware,
grocery, and retail stores. For a nearby location, call
800-376-2442.
</P>
<P>
   A last resort is to coat all bare wood surfaces with two coats
of an oil-based polyurethane varnish to seal in the odor. And hope
that the varnish odor will not linger too long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've had a sealer on my deck for 10 years. It still looks
good. Should I reseal the deck?
</P>
<P>
   DAVE CHRISTENSEN, Falmouth
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Hang in there and ignore it. Sealers last only a year or two
before needing reapplication. If the wood is pressure-treated, it
doesn't need sealing, not when it's at least 10 years old. If you
really want to reseal it, try this experiment: Apply a bit of the
new sealer in a small area; if it beads up on the deck, then don't
reseal; it is not penetrating. If it penetrates, then go ahead; at
least it is penetrating and will provide some protection against
water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My concrete retaining wall has a vertical crack. A man
suggested putting in a trench on the high side of the wall to allow
water to percolate down and away from the wall. Will this help, or
at least prevent the crack from getting bigger and leaking? The
wall is two to seven feet high.
</P>
<P>
   JOSH LEVINE, Needham
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The trench might help, but better is to drill weep holes in
the face of the wall, allowing water to drain away before it
freezes. As it is now, the crack was caused by freezing earth
expanding and pushing the wall out a little.
</P>
<P>
   So, rent an impact drill from a rental store and drill 1/2- to
3/4-inch holes right through the concrete and into the held earth,
two feet above the ground and every six feet horizontally. Make two
rows of weep holes where the wall is higher than five or six feet.
The impact drill will go through concrete like a knife through
butter; an electric drill will take decades to make a hole, even
with a masonry bit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am considering putting in a Pergo floor in my 100-year-old
kitchen, with a new plywood underlayment. But I have heard the
Pergo could crack and/or split if it is put on an uneven surface.
Can I use the Pergo?
</P>
<P>
   BRUCE TERZIAN, Dedham
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know of anything that won't crack or split when
applied to an uneven surface, except maybe carpeting. Anything
stiff or rigid (Pergo, being laminated plastic, is rigid) will
react badly to such a surface. So will ceramic tile; the bigger the
tile, the more it will crack. That is why underlayment is
suggested, to even out bumpy areas and make sure there are no lips
left where the plywood pieces meet. In fact, Pergo comes with firm
foam backing that will also help prevent cracking and splitting.
That is all you need: a smooth, even surface.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With the flourish of a pen at Friday's signing
ceremony, Benjamin Netanyahu, the right-wing prime minister of
Israel, has positioned himself as a centrist and redefined the
relationship between the two major political parties of his
country.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to give back more land to the Palestinians,
Netanyahu has shaken up the right-wing, religious and immigrant
coalition that keeps him in power by a razor-thin margin. But he
has swooped in on and, at least momentarily, seized the emerging
center, coopting the issue _ peace _ that has defined the
opposition Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   There is likely to be much political turmoil on the prime
minister's return. Smarting with betrayal, Jewish settlers plan
demonstrations starting Saturday night and construction of new
settlements, perhaps as soon as Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And a hard-right, fringe party, Moledet, has called for a vote
of no confidence in Netanyahu's government Monday, when Parliament
formally reopens with a speech by the prime minister. A successful
no-confidence vote would lead to new elections in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   But, turmoil or not, Netanyahu returns strengthened by his
moment on the world stage, by the concessions he has made _ and
extracted _ to revive a peace effort supported by the majority of
Israeli citizens. In the short run, then, he is likely to survive
politically, at least partly because the Labor Party, unwilling to
let any government be toppled on the issue of peace, has promised
him a two-week ``safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not bring down the government in this no-confidence
vote,'' Eli Goldschmidt, Labor's chief parliamentary whip, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The accord reached in the peace talks must be submitted to the
Cabinet and then the Parliament for approval. Meir Shitrit, the
chairman of Netanyahu's coalition, said Friday night that he has
counted 90 votes in favor of the peace agreement out of 120 votes
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote is taken, however, there may be an inexorable
momentum toward the formation of a unity government or early
elections. Labor Party leaders, whose support Netanyahu needs if he
genuinely loses the right, say they will withdraw their safety net
for his government at the end of two weeks. They have long been
itching to bring him down, even if it means a brief, unholy
alliance with the right.
</P>
<P>
   And they want a direct role in the peace effort, which they
consider to be theirs. Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said Friday
night that Netanyahu needs Labor's help to implement the agreement
and to move on to final status talks, which are bound to be the
thorniest of all. He said he favors the idea of a unity government
with Labor leadership. Recently, however, he predicted a 50-50
chance of new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is who would call them. Would Netanyahu, whose
term expires in the year 2000, beat left and right to the punch,
effectively toppling his own government in order to redefine it?
</P>
<P>
   The right, even the hard-right fringe, is backed into a corner.
It has no visible candidate of its own; it does not want to see
Netanyahu in a center-left coalition, and it has does not want to
be left out in the cold. Many right-wing members of Parliament from
small parties, including Moledet, have a vested interest in
remaining in a government that subsidizes its activities.
</P>
<P>
   And Labor, which has been riven by in-fighting, could find
itself undercut by a Likud prime minister who has been willing to
return land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Right wing and left wing, Likud and Labor, have traditionally
been defined here by their opposition to or support for the peace
effort. This move blurs that distinction, and could force them to
develop distinct political personalities based on the issues that
distinguish parties in more traditional Western democracies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this is not a traditional Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we will see that if the peace issue moves further into
the background, the religious-secular divide will be
strengthened,'' said Gerald Steinberg, professor of political
science at Bar-Ilan University outside Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the language used Friday by religious activists has
been fiercely pointed. ``Signing this will bring danger to the soul
of Israelis,'' said Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, spiritual adviser to
the National Religious Party, which has nine members of Parliament
in Netanyahu's 61-member coalition. ``Rabbis whose rulings are
guided by religious law and virtue will not be able to cooperate
with he who causes endangerments and risks to the people of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers' leader, Aharon Domb, called Netanyau's decision to
sign an agreement ``treasonous,'' but later apologized for using
the politically charged term. After the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord was signed, the right wing repeatedly called Yitzhak
Rabin a ``traitor'' in the months before his assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Chabad, the Hasidic sect that supported Netanyahu financially,
with a ``Bibi is good for the Jews'' campaign, Friday promised a
counter-campaign in coming weeks. Chabad leaders said they would
put up thousands of huge signs showing a letter they received from
Netanyahu right before his election in 1996, promising that he
would not relinquish any land.
</P>
<P>
   Within his own party, Likud, which is ideologically divided, he
has weathered strident opposition as he moved closer to a deal.
Former Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in a scathing
interview published Friday in the Israeli newspaper Maariv that
Netanyahu has done a complete about-face to save his political
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as he is concerned, the main thing is remaining in
office, which comes even before the interests of the State of
Israel,'' Shamir said.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu has proved skillful at defanging his opposition on
the right. And they were the intended audience for his bolts from
the negotiating table during the peace talks, including his
last-minute, unexpected move to raise the issue of the release from
prison of a right-wing cause celebre _ convicted spy Jonathan
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the greatest electoral challenge
Netanyahu perceives comes from the broad center _ specifically
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the retired army chief of staff, who has
beaten Netanyahu in polls. Lipkin-Shahak has yet to throw his hat
in the political ring, and the idea of a new centrist party, which
was the talk of Israel during the summer, has not yet taken shape.
</P>
<P>
   The political calculus is complex and unpredictable. There could
be acts of terrorism or breakdowns in relations with the
Palestinians. What seems certain, though, is that Netanyahu's
political fate will be played out as Israeli troops are withdrawn
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may end up having a raucous Israeli election campaign take
place at the same time as this very complicated and sensitive
agreement is being implemented,'' said Joseph Alpher, director of
the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``If so, you can be sure
that there will be an interesting dynamic between them.''

 &HT;    ROAD TO PEACE AGREEMENT PAVED WITH DRAMA, FATIGUE
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-DEAL-1024.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Diplomatic drama gets no better than this, a
tale of intrigue and high passion, history and war, a king and his
queen, a dog and a spy.
</P>
<P>
   With a roaring fire to ward off autumn's chill, a table of veal
and fish for sustenance and stirring words from a revered and
ailing monarch, President Clinton led Israeli and Palestinian
leaders through a sleepless quest for peace, winding down nine days
of intensive summitry with 28 unbroken hours of compromise,
soul-searching and hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   By sun-up Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat had agreed to a
dramatic land-for-security plan that broke a 19-month impasse in
the tortured Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions broke, handshakes were exchanged and cigars were lit in
the Wye River Conference Center where negotiators had clustered
around a gas-fueled fireplace, listened to the distant honking of
Canada geese and gazed out upon the fall foliage lining the banks
of the tranquil Wye River on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But as aides readied gleaming black limos and the olive and
white presidential helicopter to ferry the leaders to a formal
White House signing ceremony, the parties hit a pothole on the path
to peace.
</P>
<P>
   An ugly and serious disagreement broke out between U.S. and
Israeli officials over a proposal that Clinton release former U.S.
Naval intelligence agent Jonathan Pollard, convicted in 1987 of
passing classified information on to Israeli officials and
sentenced to life in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials began telling reporters gathered here that
Clinton had backed out at the last minute from a promise to release
Pollard, a charge the White House immediately denied, saying there
was no such promise, explicit or implied.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have clearly hit a snag and are trying to work our way
through it,'' U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, his
voice audibly distressed from fatigue, told an equally weary gaggle
of reporters. ''I really don't have any more to give you.''
</P>
<P>
   It took seven tense hours for Netanyahu and Clinton to iron out
the dispute, backed up by Israeli diplomats and their American
counterparts, who worked from a cramped attic room with a cement
floor and walls decorated with cobwebs, scarecrows, pumpkins and
other Halloween figures.
</P>
<P>
   The distrust and suspicion that haunted the talks finally lifted
around 2 p.m. EDT, the leaders sped back to Washington and two
hours later they stood on a gold-carpeted dais in the White House
East Room, smiling, bracing peace and exchanging credit for the
hard-won agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing Clinton as ''a warrior for peace,'' Netanyahu portrayed
the president as a tireless, even pesky, advocate who used the
seven days he spent at Wye ''to nudge and prod,'' the parties to
make peace. ''I mean, he doesn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton praised Jordanian King Hussein, who left
Rochester, Minn., where he's been undergoing cancer treatment at
the Mayo Clinic, to lend the weight of his authority to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Striding into a large dining room late Thursday, his striking
American-raised Queen Noor at his side, Hussein implored the
parties to imagine peace for the sake of their children and,
Clinton said, proffered ''stern instructions at the appropriate
times,'' to help push negotiators the last few inches toward the
diplomatic goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really had a profound effect on both parties ... almost an
inspiration,'' Clinton's top Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Less profound, perhaps, was the impact that Clinton's Labrador
retriever, Buddy, had on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, however, took an immediate shine to the year-old
chocolate Lab, in an atmosphere where friends aren't to be taken
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Victors in peace, alas, some of the negotiators fell victim to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   After going, in some cases, 48 hours with no sleep, members of
the Israeli and American delegations could be seen nodding off
toward the end of a 90-minute East Room signing ceremony Friday,
particularly deep into Arafat's 20-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu fought off fatigue, catching his head several times as
it dropped mischievously toward his chest. His foreign minister,
Ariel Sharon, surrendered unconditionally to slumber, resting his
ample chin on a dark grey vest and resting, peaceably no doubt,
through about half of Arafat's well chosen words.

UNTYPICAL AUTO EXECUTIVE WRITES AN UNTYPICAL BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert A. Lutz is not your typical auto executive _ and that has
to be the understatement of the year in this space. The former
president and vice-chairman of Chrysler is a man of contrasts, a
denim-and-sneakers mind-set in double-breasted demeanor, a
cigar-loving, martini-drinking vegetarian _ and the guy who
engineered Chrysler's second resurrection from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Boston last week to visit with the New England Motor
Press Association and discuss corporate philosophy, the state of
American education, the history of Chrysler, business theory, cars
_ and, not incidentally, plug his new book, ``GUTS: The Seven Laws
of Business That Made Chrysler The World's Hottest Car Company''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $24.95 hardcover, 220 pp.).
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lutz is demonstrably brilliant, speaks several languages,
but didn't finish high school until he was 22. He is not your
typical All-American boy, either, having been born to a life of
wealth and privilege in Zurich; his father was a banker, his mother
inspired in him a love of cars. His father's business dealings
brought young Bob Lutz to America _ and into American public
schools _ frequently. Eventually, he did a stint in the Marine
Corps, earning fighter pilot's wings and a commission _ he still
flies, frequently at the controls of his Czech Albatros military
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually strait-laced Bob found himself at the University of
California at Berkeley, where he earned his undergraduate degree at
the ripe old age of 29, then went on to earn an MBA.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody is qualified to comment on the world of automobile
manufacturing, it is Lutz; he has labored here and abroad for four
of the majors _ General Motors, BMW, Ford, and Chrysler, landing at
the last in 1986. Chrysler, you may recall, had been snatched from
the jaws of bankruptcy by Lee Iacocca, who engineered concessions
from bankers and suppliers, cementing the arrangement with federal
loan guarantees _ it was not a government bailout, Lutz was quick
to remind us, but merely Uncle Sam as cosigner, not the lender. (In
fact, the goverment not only didn't lend Chrysler a dime but scored
a significant windfall for taxpayers from the company's comeback.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Lutz writes, the patient, having been cured, resumed the
unhealthy lifestyle. Now it was Lutz who would engineer a recovery
_ this time without federal guarantees. ``Leadership is what
enabled Chrysler to turn around,'' Lutz said _ and Lutz would lead,
bringing a right-brain approach to bear on a left-brain business.
Plus the Seven Laws of Lutz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el6 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; L &UR; xr &LR; utz Law No. 1: The customer is not always right.
Customers don't always know what they want, Lutz says, and
customers often lie about what they want. The proof of that is in
the so-called focus groups wherein customers are surveyed about
wants in future product. Customers will invariably opt for the
practical, for more of everything, and indicate willingness to pay
_ in focus groups. Left-brain, practical, answers. But in the
market, decisions are more likely to be based on emotion tempered
by wallet _ they want pizazz, can't always pay for the stuff they
say they'd like to have.
</P>
<P>
   The result of focus-group design is frequently boring cars.
``Don't ask the customer to do your creative work,'' Lutz commands.
It is better, he says, to go with a car that excites a minority
than a car that is merely acceptable to the majority.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the first Law of Lutz strange, the second should
really floor you: The primary goal of business is not to make
money. ``Some companies confuse the mission with the reward,'' Lutz
explains. ``Focus on the product and the customer and the money
will follow,'' he says. This is heresy in some corporate halls
where the rate of return is the focus of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission at Chrysler is to build cars people will enjoy and
want to buy again,'' Lutz says _ and Chrysler is making more money
than ever, so maybe the man is right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el6 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; T &UR; xr &LR; oo much quality can ruin you, is another Law of
Lutz, and that got him going on the subject of J.D. Powers'
customer satisfaction surveys, the generally accepted measure of
quality (at least in the press). ``We have permitted Powers to
define quality as the absence of negatives,'' Lutz said. ``That is
like defining food quality as the absence of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cars today have bulletproof reliablility,'' Lutz said. But
customers may be madly desirous of some cars even though the defect
rate is not at the top of the Powers chart. Dodge Viper illustrates
the point, Lutz offered, an outrageously powered (400 horspeower,
V-10 engine) sports car with no roof, no door handles, and no side
windows when it came out, yet it took the world by storm,
completely sold out, and gave Chrysler an image as an innovative
car company. Viper was a product of the right brain _ the
left-brained side of the company counseled against building it.
</P>
<P>
   Teamwork isn't always a good thing, another Lutz-ism counsels.
Business has ``become enamored of teams as a solution to
everything,'' Lutz says, but it's often just a ``copout of
management avoiding a decision. Spending time seeking consensus is
not the same as doing work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership to Lutz is about common sense, and common sense
dictates that we hold each other accountable _ we need to be
outraged, he advises. If we accept mediocrity or shoddy goods and
services without complaint, then we encourage them, Lutz says.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz really does believe in cooperation and teamwork, though, as
long as it's OK to make waves in pursuit of excellence. He has
instituted a whole new kind of teamwork at Chrysler, the platform
teams responsible for car development. He is a maverick who has
risen to power and achievment in the corporate world where
mavericks traditionally are outcasts. Lutz leaves it to F. Scott
Fitzgerald to explain his paradoxical nature: ``The test of
intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas and still
function.'' That would make Lutz a genius, in Fitzgerald's terms.
</P>
<P>
   He's a maverick in anybody's terms, a man who convinced Iacocca
to build Viper, brought it in under budget and ahead of schedule;
who would drive a new Jeep through a plate glass window at
Detroit's Cobo Hall or drop a new Dodge Ram from the ceiling _ the
focus groups, by the way, were turned off by the Ram, but Lutz got
it built anyway. And there's Prowler, plus a whole slew of
eye-grabbing concept cars.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we didn't hear from Lutz: ``brand management,'' the
current buzzword among the Chrysler competition. Chrysler has been
there, done that, abandoned it. It works for soap, not cars, Lutz
wrote in his book. Chrysler is in the car business.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the Lutz Laws and a good lesson in creative
business philosophy, you can buy and read the book. Lutz doesn't
need the dough, but it would be a good thing if he sold a lot of
copies _ to General Motors. They could use his expertise over
there. If this were the movies, the GM board would offer him the
helm. Now that would make a great book.

FOR MIDWESTERN REPUBLICANS, TIMES ARE GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ind., Mo., Ohio, Ill., Wis., Iowa, Mich.)  (Also moving in ``p'' news file) 
(mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ These are flush times for Republicans in the
Midwest and Mike Johanns is not being shy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are within days of recapturing the governor's office,''
Johanns, the Republican candidate for governor in Nebraska, crowed
to a luncheon of the Benson Women's Republican Club in a church
basement on the north side of Omaha. As for the other state and
federal offices, he asserted, ``If we do our job right, we'll have
a clean sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   If the polls are any gauge, he is probably right. In the latest
poll, Johanns leads his opponent, Bill Hoppner, by 20 percentage
points in their race to replace Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat who is
barred by law from seeking a third term. Republicans are expected
to easily retain all three of the state's congressional seats; in
fact, there is no Democrat running in the 3rd Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   In state races, the Democrats are running no candidates for two
seats on the Nebraska Public Service Commission, which regulates
phone service, and the Democratic candidate for state attorney
general was chosen by the party only after no candidate made the
filing deadline and a write-in candidate declined to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the governor's office, it's up and down the
line,'' said Dr. Robert Sittig, a political science professor at
the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. ``The Democrats _ they're
really going to get hosed this time in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seen better days in much of the Midwest. Only
Nebraska, Indiana and Missouri have Democratic governors. And
Republicans are considered likely winners in at least seven of the
nine governors' races in November.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control 14 of the 23 legislative chambers in the
12 states. (Nebraska's unicameral Legislature is nonpartisan.)
Democratic Senate seats in Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin are
considered vulnerable and Democrats are in tough races to retain
congressional seats in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwestern Republicans have done much better in the 1990s
than they did in the 1980s,'' said John Green, director of the
Bliss Institute, a nonpartisan political research institute at the
University of Akron. ``These folks have been able to take their
program down to the state legislatures. Even when they don't win,
they're kind of the dominant force politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, especially since Republicans took control
of Congress in 1994, the party's influence has grown stronger and
deeper in nearly every Midwestern state, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   They say Midwestern Republicans have crafted a different strain
of elected official. Drawing on the plain-spoken, no-nonsense
Midwest ethos _ and realizing that to win they have to play to
urban centers like Cleveland and Detroit _ these politicians are
seen as pragmatic and moderate, focusing more on fiscal and
administrative issues and less on ideological ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwestern Republican parties are much more moderate than
the party at large and than the South,'' Green said. ``They tend to
stay away from issues that you can't compromise on: abortion, gun
control, gay rights. Some of these Midwestern Republicans are kind
of uninspiring people. They are really managers rather than
ideologues. You ask them where are the big policy changes and they
just give you a blank look _ `This is the big policy change. We're
running the government well.'''
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans are not only interested in running government
efficiently, but in using the government to implement policy,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin has been the nation's most
aggressive governor on welfare reform, an issue that has also been
seized by Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Gov. George Voinovich of
Ohio. And Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois and Gov. Terry Branstad of
Iowa have tried to convince more conservative Republican
legislators to increase education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't conservatives who don't want to do anything,''
said John Bibby, a political science professor at the University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee. ``They want to solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican candidates for statewide office in the Midwest
seem to fit the more moderate mold. In the Kansas gubernatorial
primary, Gov. Bill Graves defeated a candidate backed by the
conservative Christian right. Johanns, the mayor of Lincoln, Neb.,
who describes himself as a ``pragmatic conservative,'' defeated two
more conservative opponents in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican state senator
who is ahead in the polls against Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.
Experts believe his conservative views would make victory difficult
if it weren't for a series of political and personal missteps made
by Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Democrats say Republican efforts to embrace more
moderate constituencies, and their ability to preside over the
recent booming economy, have made it difficult for Democratic
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough difference between me and Bill Graves to
motivate moderate Republicans to vote for me,'' said Jim Slattery,
a former Democratic congressman from Kansas who ran unsuccessfully
for governor in 1994 against Graves. ``That's the problem that
Democrats are running into. If you drift to the right or the left,
there isn't much room in there before you drift into the danger
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it seems no accident that in Indiana, Evan
Bayh, the Democratic former governor who is given a solid chance of
winning the race for Senate, uses the word ``conservative'' several
times in his advertising and does not mention the word
``Democrat.'' In Illinois, the Democratic nominee for governor,
Rep. Glenn Poshard, with his opposition to abortion rights and some
gay rights issues, as well as his past votes against gun control,
has been accused of being more conservative than the Republican
candidate, Secretary of State George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   James Reichley, a professor of political science at Georgetown
University, said that with the decline in Midwest Democratic
machine politics and as cities sprawl further into the suburbs,
Democrats ``can't rely on those bases like they used to, in cities
like Detroit and Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   An extreme example of a weakened Democratic Party, he said, is
playing out in Michigan, where Geoffrey Feiger, the iconoclastic
and abrasive lawyer for Jack Kevorkian, won the Democratic primary
for governor even though party leaders did not endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, the Republican ascendancy did not happen overnight.
Registered Republicans in the state have long outnumbered
Democrats, but Sittig said there has been such a strong Republican
surge in the past few years that there are now about 125,000 more
registered Republicans than Democrats. Republicans have even pulled
ahead in Douglas County, which includes Omaha and has been the most
reliable source of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And registered Republicans now seem more likely to vote
Republican. Over the years, Nebraska, proud of its
independent-minded voters, has elected many Democratic governors
and senators. But in 1996, Chuck Hagel, a Republican businessman
and political newcomer, won a race for the U.S. Senate against Gov.
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason we've seemed to always elect Democrats,''
said Kerry Winterer, chairman of the Douglas County Republican
Party. ``Historically we've always had this populist streak and
frankly, I think that's what changed. Republicans have done a
better job of trying to get people to identify with parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob Kerrey and former Sen. Jim
Exon, said he was confident, polls notwithstanding, that Nebraskans
would continue voting for Democratic governors. ``There's more and
more Nebraskans that understand what my background is and what I'm
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Boyle, chairman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said
it has been difficult for Democrats to raise enough money to
campaign across a large rural state. She also believes, she said,
that Republicans have managed to win the votes of anti-abortion
Democrats. Ms. Boyle said she was trying to re-energize the party
and noted that Democrats have historically been able to unseat
Republican governors after just one term.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, there is even talk about whether Nelson,
considered a conservative Democrat, will switch parties. Nelson,
who is believed to be toying with another run for the Senate in
2000, says he did not start the speculation. But he is not
discouraging it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very careful not to rule anything in or rule
anything out,'' Nelson said.

POLLARD'S CONVICTION FOR SPYING REMAINS A DIVISIVE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Second take is expected to move by 9:30 p.m. ET.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For 13 years, the case against the convicted spy Jonathan Jay
Pollard has symbolized darker aspects of the normally warm
relationship between the United States and Israel while exposing
fissures long dividing American and Israeli Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the Pollard case has emerged from the diplomatic
wings and crept toward center stage whenever U.S. and Israeli
leaders have sat down to talk. Rarely, though, has it been the
dominant force that it suddenly became on Friday, when it looked
for a while as though it might unsettle the latest peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite strong emotions produced by Pollard's life sentence
in prison, in both Israel and this country, the exact nature of his
crimes has never been fully clear.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters demanding his release from a federal prison in North
Carolina say he has served more than enough time, arguing that he
handed Israel strategic information that in their view the United
States should have been sharing with an ally from the start.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are officials in U.S. security agencies and
the Justice Department who say it is impossible to overstate the
damage that Pollard's espionage inflicted on U.S.
intelligence-gathering in the Middle East and possibly also in the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But they have never elaborated or opened government files laying
out precisely what he had done, except to say it was serious _ a
view that thus far has been sustained by three U.S. presidents:
Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton. The fact that Pollard
acted in behalf of a friendly nation is irrelevant, the chief
prosecutor in the Pollard case, Joseph diGenova, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't have two standards for spying,''
said diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
``It's all bad.''

FIRSTUSE.COM OFFERS PROTECTION   FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Copy it right.
</P>
<P>
   Have a screenplay you'd like to protect (and writing your own
screenplay seems to be almost a residency requirement in L.A.)? Or
for that matter, a song, novel, multimedia clip or other
intellectual property, even a will or deal memo, whose date of
creation needs to be certified?
</P>
<P>
   You could mail yourself a sealed envelope containing your work,
or go to a notary public. But those tactics might not withstand a
court challenge. Instead, you might want to check out Firstuse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Using a small program run off the company's Web site (at
www.firstuse.com), it will create a unique, time-stamped ``digital
fingerprint'' of your work and store that record.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, the program creates a ``hash number,''
which is a string of numbers the program generates based on that
exact document, said Firstuse marketing vice president Cliff
Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you don't change your registered work (backup,
backup, backup, but you should be doing that anyway with any
document you care about), the site can then certify you created
that work years before some Hollywood sleazeball ripped it off for
a major motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said the digital fingerprinting approach beats older
methods, most of which have been successfully challenged in courts
over their veracity, and none of which has been updated for the
digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works in any computer language, on audio, video, text
written in any human language,'' Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are reasonable, but not cheap, with costs ranging from
$4.50 to $15 per registration, depending on how many you buy at a
time. Sure beats those frantic trips to the post office. &UR;  &QL;

IMACS BEING SNAPPED UP
</P>
<P>
   By just about any standard, the new iMac from Apple Computer has
been a success: The company reports selling a whopping 278,000 of
the inexpensive, powerful all-in-one machines in the first six
weeks of the product's launch.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it the best-selling debut of any Apple product ever.
It punctuated the company's first profitable year since 1995,
announced by company CEO/co-founder Steve Jobs even as he unveiled
the latest version of the Macintosh operating system, Mac OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   And even more interesting have been the details about who's
buying the sleek, distinctive blue-and-white machines and what that
could mean for the future of the formerly struggling computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of iMac buyers are first-time computer users,
and another 14 percent or so had been using Windows-based
computers, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing trade papers are reporting that some businesses are
buying iMacs, rather than a Windows-based machine, to handle all
their routine office work.
</P>
<P>
   The iMacs are designed for networking, with built-in Ethernet
and high-speed modems, but no floppy drive. As such, they're
perfect for college students hooking up to the campus network in
their dorm room, or for small businesses trying to create or expand
a small, easily maintained network of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac's success is a key to Apple's still-precarious future,
because it's the company's best chance to expand its market share
and keep companies developing software that will run on the highly
regarded Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some fruit of the strategy is about to be harvested.
Gaming giant Electronic Arts is considering creating Mac games for
the first time because of the iMac's success, said spokeswoman
Patty Redlin.
</P>
<P>
   FutureCop: LAPD, one of EA's first-ever ventures into Mac
gaming, debuts this winter as a hybrid title that will run on
either Macs or PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Calabasas-based THQ Inc. just released its own hybrid title,
Redjack: Revenge of the Brethren, about a month ago, though company
spokesman Mark Ellermeyer said that was somewhat unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Redjack was already well along when THQ signed a publishing deal
with its developer. But more Mac titles could happen in the future,
Ellermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company line is that we'll do games for the popular
platforms, so the more there are of a certain platform, the more
likely we are to create games for them,'' Ellermeyer said. ``If the
iMac takes off like they're predicting, we'll certainly look at
producing more games for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Macs have long been an excellent platform for games
because of their superior graphics and audio abilities, hard-core
players have gravitated to the PC side because its greater market
share meant the hottest new games and gaming peripherals debuted
there first.
</P>
<P>
   Mac-oriented game companies, such as MacSoft, have carved out a
niche converting some of the hottest PC titles to the Mac, but both
Apple and its customers would benefit by having more companies
creating either hybrid titles or, with a bigger slice of the
market, even Mac-first or -only games.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 8.5, by the way, is getting good advance word within the
ardent Macintosh community. Jobs unveiled the operating system's
new version at the same event at which he announced Apple's
financial results and the iMac's sales.
</P>
<P>
   System 8.5 is the first to run only on Macs with PowerPC chips,
meaning older Macs are being left behind. That's somewhat bad news
for owners of older, non-Power Mac machines, but good news for
everyone else because it allows a faster, more efficient operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   System 8.5 knits the machine ever tighter with the Internet,
especially with its V-Twin technology that indexes and synopsizes
information in remarkable ways, allowing for incredibly
sophisticated searches of huge volumes of data.
</P>
<P>
   The new version also offers more interface customization and
many other improvements, with relatively few software
incompatibilities reported so far, according to Adam Engst, the
editor of TidBits, the long-running Mac-oriented online
newsletter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A GAME BOY BY ANY OTHER COLOR
</P>
<P>
   After selling a whopping 65 million Game Boys of various sorts
over the past decade or so, Nintendo finally decided to add color
screens, showing up to 59 colors, to the best-selling game platform
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The result isn't earth-shaking, but it does add to game play and
gives developers a new capability that no doubt will be exploited
heavily in coming titles.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of color titles _ Tetris DX, Pocket Bomberman,
Quest and a game collection including Donkey Kong _ are available
now, but it almost doesn't matter because engineers figured out a
way to get even older games to display six colors when you play
them on the new machines. Now !ital!that's!off! amazing. &QL;

`CELEBRATION' A SLEEK, STYLISH FOSSE TRIBUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Nobody wants to upstage the guest of honor at his
own career retrospective. Especially when the VIP deserves the
red-carpet treatment as much as the late director-choreographer Bob
Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   So it's appropriate that the strongest personality to step
forward from ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance'' is that of
its namesake, an elegant ruffian who died in 1987 at the
far-too-early age of 60.
</P>
<P>
   In this 2{-hour ``greatest hits'' tribute, which opened
Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre, the richly diverse ensemble of
37 singer-dancers never treads on the long, stylish shadow cast by
the man whose oversize image appears only once, in a monochromatic
projection.
</P>
<P>
   That's as it should be. But it also accounts for a certain
remoteness and anonymity in this otherwise loving, meticulously
crafted Broadway-bound homage. Despite strong individual
contributions from Valarie Pettiford and Jane Lanier, who worked
first-hand with Fosse, and wonderful young dancers like Desmond
Richardson, Sergio Trujillo and Elizabeth Parkinson, most
performers' personalities stay discreetly hidden under tipped
bowler hats and slouched fedoras, until a boffo finale set to Benny
Goodman's ``Sing, Sing, Sing'' lets them really strut loose. This
creates a conceptual grayness that takes some luster off the show's
chic finish.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``Fosse'' has enough sparkling moments to supply a
splendid testimonial to a true American original.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by longtime Fosse collaborators Richard Maltby Jr.,
Chet Walker and Ann Reinking, with artistic input from Fosse's
third wife and premiere interpreter, Gwen Verdon, ``Fosse'' unfolds
on a stripped-down stage-within-a-stage. Outfitted by designer
Santo Loquasto with fake proscenium arches and dramatically layered
curtains, and surreally lit by Andrew Bridge, it has an
otherworldly feel, as if we'd been transported to some haunted
Broadway hall where Fosse's proteges have gathered for one final,
ghostly fling.
</P>
<P>
   Dance numbers have been grouped thematically and stylistically,
rather than chronologically, into three acts punctuated by two
short intermissions. This approach, abetted by Gordon Lowry
Harrell's thoughtful musical arrangements, emphasizes that as
America kept changing its tune from '50s mock tangoes and
soft-shoes to the funky bass line-driven '70s and the percussive
'80s, Fosse changed with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Act 1 ``prologue'' establishes the show's brisk pace, as
Pettiford's muscular rendition of ``Life Is Just a Bowl of
Cherries'' (from Fosse's last musical, ``Big Deal'') segues into a
montage of signature gestures from ``Damn Yankees,'' ``Red Head,''
``Cabaret,'' ``Chicago,'' ``Sweet Charity'' and other works,
performed by the full company looking like a small army of Charlie
Chaplins.
</P>
<P>
   The show amply illustrates Fosse's belief that dancers
impersonating baseball players, garment workers or underworld
felons could express themselves with their bodies as sublimely as
Kirov swans. He developed an angular vernacular of swiveling heads
and thrust-back shoulders, of wiggling fingers and well-toned
derrieres jiggling in ways that simultaneously spoofed and exalted
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Raunchier and more naturalistic than his classically trained
colleague Jerome Robbins, he brought an all-American brashness to
the Broadway dance lexicon. Drawing on native forms derived from
vaudeville and burlesque, as well as the work of such predecessors
as Agnes de Mille and Jack Cole, he invested even the most low-rent
raw material with grace, humor and silky sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' honors that spirit by sequing straight from the droll
cynicism of ``Big Spender'' _ laconically performed here by 10
female dancers posing as robotic street walkers _ to the poetic
hopefulness of ``Crunchy Granola Suite,'' from a previous Fosse
tribute, the 1978 ``Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' treats us not only to these highlights of his Broadway
career and his 1979 quasi-autobiographical Faustian feature film
``All That Jazz,'' but also to small, reconstructed gems such as a
45-second bit from the movie of ``Kiss Me Kate'' and the ``Cool
Hand Luke'' number from a Bob Hope TV special.
</P>
<P>
   In aiming for comprehensiveness, however, the show inevitably
winds up repeating itself. Take for instance ``Steam Heat,'' the
incendiary number from ``Pajama Game,'' superbly executed here by
Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex Sanchez, popping and thrusting
like air-blasted pistons. It's a tough act to follow, which may be
why the similar ``Dancin' Dan (Me and My Shadow)'' feels
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Act 3, which showcases Fosse's darker side, also needs
recontextualizing. The ``Manson Trio'' number from ``Pippin,'' with
its spooky voiceover of death tolls from various world wars, makes
a bumpy lead-in to Pettiford's ice-cool rendition of ``Mein Herr.''
</P>
<P>
   Weimar decadence is supposed to be equated with '70s free love
in the subsequent ``Take Off With Us'' routine. But this number, so
cracklingly erotic in ``All That Jazz,'' is here reduced to three
same-sex and mixed-sex couples performing semi-suggestive pas de
deux. You can see hotter stuff any night of the week on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Today's tabooless pop culture also has affected our perception
of Fosse's rough-housing baseball players from ``Damn Yankees,''
who now look a bit dandyish and quaint compared to the
boot-crunching denizens of ``Tap Dogs,'' ``STOMP!'' and ``Bring in
'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Fosse's work hasn't lost a single step is in its deft,
minimalist evocation of character. When Pettiford and Lanier close
out Act 2 with ``The Hot Honey Rag'' from ``Chicago,'' we're
reminded anew what a great dancer can do with a cane, a black body
stocking and an attitude. Fosse could do it all. When will we see
his like again?

 U.S. MOVES TO HELP MEDICARE PATIENTS DROPPED BY HMOs  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved Friday to clarify
the rights of hundreds of thousands of elderly Medicare
beneficiaries being dropped from health maintenance organizations,
and it threatened to impose fines on insurance companies that
refuse to sell them coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But under pressure from insurance companies, the administration
backed away from an earlier interpretation of federal law that
would have granted similar protections to people under age 65 who
qualify for Medicare because of disabilities. Some insurers had
threatened to sue the government if it pressed this reading of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives welcomed the administration's statement on
the rights of people with disabilities, but consumer advocates
denounced it as too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs in 30 states have notified the government that they are
pulling out of Medicare or reducing their service areas Jan. 1, in
part because their costs have risen faster than expected. The
actions have caused confusion and alarm for more than 444,000
beneficiaries who, in the words of the government, are being
``involuntarily terminated from Medicare managed care plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries have two basic options. They can enroll in another
HMO, if they can find one. Or they can enroll in the original
Medicare program. Most people in the original program buy private
insurance to fill gaps in Medicare. Such Medigap insurance helps
pay Medicare deductibles and other costs, and some policies also
cover prescription drugs, one of the biggest medical expenses for
people who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But Medigap policies often cost much more than what people were
paying for similar coverage in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials initially indicated that there was no reason
for concern. But on Oct. 8, after government offices were deluged
with complaints, President Clinton said Medicare officials must
help ``seniors who have been so shaken'' by the decisions of HMOs
to withdraw from the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a bulletin sent Friday to all state insurance commissioners,
the Clinton administration said, ``We are committed to trying to
guard beneficiaries from undue concern and unnecessary hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the federal Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said that
beneficiaries dropped from HMOs had a right to buy four of the 10
standard Medigap insurance policies. The policies that must be made
available provide basic benefits, but do not cover prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that flout this obligation face a fine of $5,000 for
each violation.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. DeParle said insurers did not have to start selling
Medigap policies to disabled people if they had not done so in the
past. Insurers usually avoid selling Medigap policies to disabled
people under 65.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Burns, director of consumer education at California's
statewide insurance counseling program, said it was a ``tragic
error'' for the government to conclude that disabled people did not
have the same rights to Medigap policies as older people had.
People with AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries and
other disabilities ``have a very tough time finding any company to
sell them a Medigap policy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Kahn, chief operating officer of the Health
Insurance Association of America, said, ``We are glad the
administration reconsidered its position and now has the same
interpretation of the law that we do.'' He said Congress had never
intended to guarantee the issue of Medigap policies to people with
disabilities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 18 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
have adopted state laws that guarantee some degree of access to
Medigap insurance for disabled people under 65.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center,
a consumer group based in New York City, said the administration's
latest interpretation of the federal law was ``much narrower'' than
its earlier interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 standard Medigap policies are designated ``A'' through
``J.'' In a notice posted on the Internet this month, the
administration said that disabled people dropped from HMOs, like
the elderly, were ``guaranteed the right to buy from any Medigap
insurer any Medigap plan designated `A,' `B,' `C' or `F.'''
Moreover, ``Medigap insurers have the same responsibility to sell
you a Medigap policy'' if you are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Archer, whose organization counsels Medicare beneficiaries
in the New York area, said: ``The Balanced Budget Act of 1997
protects people with disabilities whose HMOs are pulling out of
Medicare. It guarantees them the right to buy Medigap insurance.
But the government's narrow reading of the law undermines this
right and may leave people with disabilities without adequate
health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to state officials, Ms. DeParle said that federal
law prohibited Medigap insurers from discriminating against elderly
beneficiaries because of pre-existing medical problems. In other
words, she said, companies ``cannot consider the health status of
individual applicants in determining eligibility or premium
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   While the 1997 law does not require Medigap insurers to start
selling policies to disabled people under 65, Ms. DeParle said,
``we encourage states to find ways to help these beneficiaries'' _
for example, ``by urging plans to extend coverage voluntarily.''

RONALD BURKLE: CHAIRMAN OF FRED MEYER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the recent wave of supermarket mergers, Ronald Burkle has
proved to be the master deal maker. As chairman and largest
shareholder of Fred Meyer, he engineered its planned $8 billion
sale to Kroger last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week he guided Dominick's Supermarkets, of which he
was also chairman and major shareholder, into the arms of Safeway
for $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These are just the latest deals for Burkle, 45, who parlayed the
buying and selling of supermarkets into a fortune estimated by
Forbes at $1 billion before the latest transactions. Son of a
supermarket executive in Southern California, he began his career
bagging groceries in junior high school. In 1986 he formed the
Yucaipa Com., a Los Angeles buyout firm. Yucaipa consolidated
various supermarket chains in Southern California that were sold
last year to Fred Meyer, of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Burkle, a major donor to politicians of both parties, was so
busy wrapping up the sale of Fred Meyer that he missed a
long-planned luncheon at his Beverly Hills mansion last Monday for
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and some U.S. Representatives.
He took time later in the week to talk about the forces causing
supermarket chains to merge, a trend he sees tapering off.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What was the genesis of the two recent mergers,
particularly the Kroger acquisition of Fred Meyer? Was it to stave
off an acquisition of Kroger by Safeway?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I've actually been a believer and committed to the
consolidation of the grocery business for a long time. Purchasing
power has become more and more of an issue, and systems have
allowed the business to be run in different ways and have raised
the ante. Not many small companies can afford $200 million for
systems. Two or three billion a year in sales used to be considered
the middle of the pack; it's now hard to operate at that size.
</P>
<P>
   As you look at consolidation, every time somebody does
something, there are fewer players left. So if you want the best
partner, you have to be at the front end of it. I've had a toy
Kroger truck and Kroger car in my office for about a year, and it
was just a question of when was the right time to do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see the consolidation continuing, or are we
nearing an end?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the number of really high-quality players out there
is diminishing. It will continue, but there aren't a lot more
things that can happen. Many of the remaining companies are family
owned, and whether they sell often depends on considerations other
than the price of the stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You don't see the existing giants combining into
fewer chains?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You couldn't see Safeway and Fred Meyer-Kroger go together,
because there are too many overlaps. You couldn't see Safeway and
American Stores go together. You would have a lot of FTC and
antitrust issues that would be difficult or impossible to resolve
legally or financially. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What's in this trend for consumers? There have been
concerns that consolidation will lead to higher prices, fewer and
less conveniently located stores, and reduced selection as regional
and ethnic food suppliers have trouble getting shelf space.(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Anyone who forgets to look out for the customer will be out
of business. New systems allow you to do that much more. You can
keep better track of what you sell store by store. In the past, a
tremendous number of decisions had to be made at the division
level. Now you can do that centrally with technology. But it
actually means you know more about what customers want. There's
plenty of competition. I don't think anyone's ever accused
Albertson's and Safeway of being easy to operate against. If the
chains aren't serving part of the market, new competitors open up.
If anything, having everyone well capitalized and buying at the
lowest possible price is good for the consumer, whereas in the past
maybe everyone wasn't buying at the lowest possible price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)With these mergers, you seem to have worked yourself
out of a day job. What is next for you? Is the grocery business
going to be a big part of your future?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It could be. I'm fairly opportunistic. I love to do trading,
and I love to do real estate, and I have other companies today.
I'll be the largest individual shareholder of Kroger, but I'll be
watching them as chairman of the executive committee rather than as
chairman of the board. But I wasn't an active chairman of the board
anyway.

 &HT;    New guidelines make estates more affordable
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home buyers in metro Atlanta should be able to
purchase more expensive houses with FHA mortgages under new
guidelines that went into effect this week.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the limits, the Federal Housing Authority, a
governmental agency that insures home loans, acknowledges housing
prices have risen.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the FHA will insure mortgages in low-cost areas for
up to $109,032, a nearly $23,000 increase from the old limit of
$86,317.(cq) For a house in a high-cost area, the new limit is
$197,621, up from $170,362.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20-county Atlanta area, the new limit is $145,350, up
from $123,400, for would-be FHA buyers in the following counties:
Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb,
Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton,
Paulding, Pickens, Rockdale, Spalding and Walton (cq).
</P>
<P>
   Under an FHA loan, the agency will insure a borrower's mortgage
amount up to its limit. If the loan amount is higher than the
limit, the home buyer would have to come up with more money for a
down payment. A lender still can require a down payment regardless
of the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
   How it works
</P>
<P>
   For example, a would-be home buyer has made an agreement to
purchase a house in metro Atlanta for $150,000 and the lender is
willing to make a loan with zero down payment. With an FHA loan,
the buyer would have to come up with a $4,650(cq) down payment to
be within the limit. Under the old limits, the buyer would have had
to make a $26,600 down payment.
</P>
<P>
   If he or she could not make the required down payment, the
lender would insist on a conventional loan.
</P>
<P>
   FHA-insured loans are designed for low-income and first-time
buyers and require the borrower to pay a premium for the life of
the loan, said real estate broker, investor and author John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The loan criteria are more flexible for FHA loans than for
conventional loans, for which lenders can require more extensive
tax and financial records and more stringent credit checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a common complaint that the old $86,000 limit just
did not let you buy a house whose cost was more,'' said Stanley M.
Goldsboro Jr., vice president of real estate lending at First Union
National Bank of Georgia. ``And what can you buy for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Although lenders generally regarded the new law positively,
Goldsboro expressed concern about the amount of new construction
business it might generate in some counties where there are moves
to slow down development until better infrastructure and services
can be installed. In some counties, environmental and housing
density issues could slow growth as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high rate of development in a lot of these counties
with moratoria of one kind or another, this could possibly put the
stop on production until they come up with growth management
plans,'' he said.

 &HT;    Action-focused consensus-builder confirmed as U.S. comptroller
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David M. Walker of Atlanta, the newly confirmed
seventh Comptroller General of the United States, seems to combine
comfortably a field marshal's approach to business with a
down-to-earth manner and a concern for people.
</P>
<P>
   His firm is known as the Marine Corps of the accounting
profession, an assessment that suits Walker just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that's me _ military,'' said Walker, 47. He had
appointments to the U.S. Naval and Air Force academies but could
not attend because of a hearing loss in one ear. His son Andrew,
21, is on a Marine Corps scholarship at Villanova University. His
son-in-law is with military intelligence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as the director of his firm's global human
resources unit, Walker has preached to his corporate clients the
need for enlightened personnel policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real winners in the 21st century,'' Walker told the New
York Times, ``will have to put a higher priority on their employees
and invest more in human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Walker will be the auditor in chief of the
federal government. The appointment is for 15 years, meaning that
the Comptroller General operates with relative freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The most important of the Comptroller General's jobs is to serve
as chief executive officer of the General Accounting Office, the
watchdog for Congress, Walker said. The work of the GAO ``isn't
just about accounting, it's about accountability,'' he told a
Senate hearing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave has a bias for action, and he's excellent at building a
consensus. He will be extremely effective in the world of
government politics,'' said Stephen H. Rogers, Arthur Andersen's
Atlanta managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1995, Walker was one of two public trustees of
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and made regular
reports to Congress about the health of these programs. That
background, along with his expertise at revivifying pension funds,
makes him well-suited to address the Social Security and Medicare
problems that loom ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And Walker knows about government, having worked in senior jobs
at the U.S. Department of Labor and the Pension Guaranty Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave worked with Mayor Campbell on his budget review force
when (Campbell) was first elected,'' Rogers said. Walker ``helped
the city focus on certain aspects of its pension plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Walker has served as world wide managing partner of
human capital services. Under his direction, the Arthur Andersen
unit has increased its revenue from $10 million to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will manage a GAO that's ``had a 55 percent budget cut
(to $363 million per year) since 1995 and a one-third'' cut in
personnel, to 3,300, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not hesitate to ask Congress for more resources
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will leave Arthur Andersen, located in the Georgia
Pacific building, in a few weeks. The firm employs about 1,000 in
Atlanta and about 65,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has an interest in the personal finance, having become a
registered investment adviser and having written a guide to
``Retirement Security'' published by John Wiley &AMP; Sons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His top tip on retirement planning: Many people base their
decision about reducing their stock holdings in favor of more
conservative fixed income investments ``on the time that they
retire. That's a mistake. They should look at their life
expectancy'' before decreasing their equity exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, Walker has done some financial planning of his own.
His new job pays $136, 700 per year, less than one-sixth what he
has been making in Atlanta.

 &HT;    Rappers come to town to discuss lucrative business
 &HT;    By Ernie Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rap music, one of the most consistent moneymakers in
the record business, will see many of its luminaries in town next
week for a three-day forum, with the theme: ``A Unified Hip-Hop
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rap, an industry approaching its 20th anniversary, is an
odd-shaped moneymaking machine, according to Darryl James,
organizer of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   James, publisher and editor of Los Angeles-based Rap Sheet, an
industry paper specializing in rap music, says rap and country &AMP;
western music are the two most consistent growth segments of the
music market.
</P>
<P>
   And though rap music is performed mostly by African-American
males in their early 20s, more than half the records are bought by
white males, said James. In fact, 85 percent of all rap sales are
to male customers. That popularity among the white audience, in
evidence since 1989, has been a powerful engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Platinum records were unknown until the market took that
turn,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry figures for the last full year, rap sold
10.1 percent of the $12.2 billion in domestic record sales in 1997.
And at midyear, the record industry was running 12 percent ahead of
the last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty good growth in an industry that dates from the
release of the Sugar Hill Gang in 1979, and whose demise is
predicted now and then by its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has matured,'' said James, and growth will be on
the minds of most of the performers, producers and fans who will
converge on the Atlanta Renaissance Hotel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   What are the signs of the maturity?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the violence frequently associated with rap has
subsided, James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why artists are now appearing more readily
at public concerts, the kind of outings that once caused concern
over possible crowd violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, contrary to the self-absorbed ``gangsta'' image
many of the groups cultivate, many are involved in community
projects and spend time with youngsters encouraging them to succeed
in school and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master P (one of the most successful rap producers) spends a
lot of time around the country doing unpublicized things to help
communities,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if rap is really genuine, if the performers are really
from the rocky backgrounds portrayed in much of their music, James,
with a smile, said ``that's all relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Said he, ``In my position, I try to avoid value judgments. I
just report and let readers decide. But I can say there are several
categories in the maturing business. They include the gangsta
style, with groups like NWA, and then there are the street
reporters like Ice Cube, and also the message bringers like Public
Enemy and Brand Nubian.''
</P>
<P>
   Another segment, including performers like Wil Smith (cq) and LL
Cool J (cq), are rappers who have become personalities that
outshine their successful music, leading to lucrative acting,
commercial advertising and other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Luke (cq), formerly associated with notorious 2Live Crew (cq),
will appear to talk about censorship and other issues, but James
said censorship per se has not been rap's central problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem mostly is how to get to the next levels, how to
take care of financial business, and that will occupy much of our
time in workshops,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   James, a Chicagoan who graduated with a degree in communications
in 1988 from Cal State Northridge, is a musician in his own right,
playing concert clarinet and other woodwinds.
</P>
<P>
   James said his publication, Rap Sheet, which he says is the most
prominent black-owned news organ, focuses on new groups before they
gain national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that by relying on regional stringers, reporters on the
ground in various localities, to write about the action they know
best.''
</P>
<P>
   And who is Rap Sheet covering, and who is likely to burst onto
the national scene?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for Three 6 Mafia (cq) out of Memphis, and, out of
Chicago, Twista (cq) and Sneed Knot Mobstaz (cq),'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   That's word from Darryl James, whose paper, Rap Sheet, covers
what he calls the ``bleeding edge'' of the business.

 &HT;    High-tech Atlanta lagging behind in teleworking
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Richard Skinner logged onto his computer one recent
morning and called an emergency meeting of a metro Atlanta group
pulling together an upcoming conference on teleworking. Response to
the Oct. 23 program was disappointing, the Clayton College &AMP; State
University president told the group via e-mail. Less than 100
people had signed up. The group, known as the Metro Atlanta
Telecommuting Advisory Council, or MATAC, had hoped to draw several
hundred people from around the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The members then voted online to postpone the event until next
year, possibly the spring when the city begins its second ozone
action season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more on people's radar screens when there's problems with
the ozone,'' MATAC spokesman John Shiffert reasoned. ``You just
can't run something like this (conference) with just a couple of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiffert paused, adding ``You know, it's an identity problem.
Business just doesn't seem to quite get it yet. What does this say
about Atlanta broadly? That's the sort of question we're scratching
our heads over at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of sight. Out of mind. Out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   In a town that promotes itself as one of the technology beacons
of the Southeast, Atlanta employers may be behind the high tech
curve when it comes to embracing the idea of letting workers work
outside the office with the help of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, Atlantans still believe that a worker has to
be sitting in a cubicle or behind an office door to be working,''
said Cory VanGundy, a teleworker who works for
PricewaterhouseCoopers helping clients learn how to make technology
work for them through teleworking, remote access and salesforce
automation. ``Until management by objective truly catches on, this
is going to be a tough push.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Atlantans) just got compared to Los Angeles not too long
ago in terms of traffic problems. I'm hoping we'll start to model
that city in the solutions they provide. There's quite a few
teleworkers out West.''
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of metro Atlantans do some sort of
teleworking from time to time, only about 30 or 40 of metro
Atlanta's largest employers _ BellSouth, Nortel Networks, Georgia
Power and PriceWaterhouseCoopers (CQ) _ have formal teleworking
policies, according to Atlanta teleworking experts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact there seems to be very limited use of teleworking in the
Southeast, according to the International Telework Association &AMP;
Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few places like Atlanta, which took a
giant step forward in teleworking during the Olympics, and Austin,
Texas, which is making a big push into technology, the South is
relatively slow in adapting teleworking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been embraced at the small to midsized companies in
the Southeast or in state and local governments,'' said Gail
Martin, executive director of ITAC, which is hosting a three-day
teleworking conference that begins Sunday (OCT. 25) at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Snellville-based teleworking expert Michael Dziak said when he
started promoting the idea of teleworking and telecommuting in
1991, ``I fully underestimated the resistance from management to
recognizing the benefits of telecommuting. After eight years, it's
kind of frustrating sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But among companies whose employees can work from home, the idea
is a popular one.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Power, one of Georgia's teleworking pioneers, about
140 employees are teleworkers. Most are able to telework with the
use of laptop computers keeping the cost fairly minimal,
spokesperson Michele Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The company adapted teleworking about five years ago ``to ease
some of the crowdiness in the downtown offices'' and to find
alternatives to ease the city's traffic problems. Once improvements
are added to the computer system next year, plans are to allow more
people to telework, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some (managers) who are comfortable with it and
others who aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Teleworkers, such as Georgia Power employee Linda Leathers, like
the flexibility. She works a couple of days a week from her Duluth
home, avoiding a 90-minute commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found I could be more productive. I generally work more
hours, probably 9 or 10 (hours a day),'' said Leathers, a mother of
two who has been telecommuting for about 18 months. ``But I'm not
nearly as tired and I feel so much better about the work I've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   As assistant to vice president and corporate secretary Judy
Anderson, Leathers said she has `` plenty of work that lends itself
well to working from the home environment.'' She helps her boss
oversee the operations of the company's various buildings and how
they are used, and works on the company's charitable and community
projects.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, however, ground rules have to be set.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, VanGundy (CQ) works in the basement of his
Dunwoody home and if his wife _ who stays at home to care for their
two small children _ needs to reach him, she has to call him on the
phone just as if he were in a traditional office setting.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, VanGundy pointed out, including, it can be
lonely and isolating. And, experts admit, it is not for everyone.
If you're not a self-starter, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dziak said, many companies have tabled the issue
because they're concerned with other matters such as sagging stock
prices, workers' compensation issues and worker shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discovered that an organization won't make a decision to
establish a telework program until they're pushed into it _ because
they've run out of office space or have a recruiting problem or
can't find people.'' In the next couple of years, however, Atlanta
will be ``turning the corner'' on the idea, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the region is choking on its own success: foul air and
traffic foul-ups (metro Atlantans drive more miles per day than
people in other major metropolitan area) will force more metro
Atlanta companies to consider it. Atlanta's failure to meet the
federal government's clean air standards has essentially blocked
the region from being able to use federal road funds to build more
roads, according to Marlin Gottschalk, program manager with the
Environmental Protection Division's air protection branch in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a comprehensive public transportation system we
only have two bus systems covering three counties in a 20-county
metropolitan area,'' Gottschalk said. ``Teleworking is one option.
It's a very important one. There's nothing like teleworking to take
the cars off the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also say teleworking is good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a business case for it,'' said Richard Skinner,
one of the area's leading proponents of teleworking.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics left Atlanta with a high-tech legacy and more fiber
optic wiring than most places, experts said. That high-tech
advantage, along with scored of telecommunications companies, make
teleworking a natural for the are's technology initiatives, they
said.Teleworking could also help recruiting efforts by companies,
in addition to helping relieve traffic congestion and improving air
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any short-term quick fixes, except for
teleworking,'' Skinner said. ``We've done it well (during the
Olympics) and we have one of the best telecommunications
infrastructures in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEWORKING AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   DEFINITION: A person who works outside their company's main
office or corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY: The phrase was coined 25 years ago by Jack Nilles, a
NASA physicist who was battling Los Angeles traffic.
</P>
<P>
   NUMBERS: About 11.1 million, up from 4 million in 1990. By the
year 2000, there are projected to be 14 million teleworkers.
</P>
<P>
   COST: Generally, less than $5,000 to outfit a worker.

MISFORTUNE OF HEDGE FUNDS IS CONVERTED INTO BARGAINS 
</HEADLINE>

(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25)

<P>
   The fallout from the recent hedge-fund eruptions continues to
waft into the nooks and crannies of the financial markets. One
asset class caught in the downdraft is convertible bonds, which
according to the First Boston Convertible Bond Index have fallen
21.5 percent since April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Converts, as they are known, initially fell for the same reasons
that stocks did: the meltdown in emerging markets and fears of
recession. But the slide in their prices _ and the corresponding
increase in their yields, which move in the opposite direction _
was worsened by widespread selling among hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Patel, manager of the Third Avenue High-Yield fund,
which holds some convertibles, says leveraged players, including a
very large number of hedge funds, felt compelled to sell their
positions in convertible bonds to raise needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hedge funds control 40 percent to 50 percent of the
$120 billion market in convertible bonds, according to Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Converts are corporate bonds with a feature that allows the
holder to convert the fixed-income securities into a set number of
common shares of the issuing corporation. Converting such bonds can
be a lucrative transaction in a rising market, making the
securities popular among many investors because of the close
relationship between the price of the bonds and the underlying
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For hedge funds, however, a common tactic is to short the common
stock of a company, betting that it will fall, and to buy its
convertible bonds as a hedge against the possibility that the stock
will rise.
</P>
<P>
   To short a stock, an investor borrows shares and then sells
them, expecting to replace them after the price declines and pocket
the difference. If the stock rises, however, the hedge fund is
somewhat protected because the price of the convertible, which is
also paying interest, is likely to rise, too, helping to offset the
loss from the short transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually swift fall in converts in the third quarter caught
many hedge funds off guard, forcing them to liquidate positions,
which in turn put more pressure on the market. At the same time,
hedge funds' bets in other markets were going awry, and many were
forced to unwind convertible positions to raise cash, said John P.
Calamos, president of Calamos Asset Management in Naperville, Ill.,
and manager of the Calamos Convertible Hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   A result is a table-thumping buy opportunity, money managers
say. ``This is the kind of opportunity we only see a couple of
times each decade,'' said Charles Pohl, manager of the Putnam
Convertible Income-Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, investors can benefit from resulting anomalous
situation. Many converts have higher yields than those of the
comparable nonconvertible bonds issued by the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia/HCA Healthcare, for example, has a nonconvertible bond,
rated triple-B, with a 7 percent coupon due in 2007 that is trading
at 92.25 percent of its face value, with a yield of 8.26 percent.
The same company has a convertible bond that is rated slightly
lower _ triple-B-minus _ and has a coupon of 6.75 percent due in
2006.
</P>
<P>
   It is trading at 80.25 percent of par, with a yield of 10.47
percent. So buyers of the convertible now get a security with a
higher yield and retain the possibility of converting their
investment into common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The best course for individuals, however, may be investing in a
convertible mutual fund. Buying individual bonds is costly _ one
typically needs at least $10,000 to buy one bond _ and analyzing
the securities can be complicated, because it requires an
understanding of the underlying stock as well as the bond.

COMMENTARY: LOVING HIM TO DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
8  nypt 9   (  ATTN11: N.C.,   Wyo12.)  
(js 13 ) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know Matthew Shepard in death. Now there's at least a
fleeting image of him in life. Distraught about the murder in
Wyoming, Tim Kirkman &UR; 14 &LR; , a young gay film maker, spent frantic
days searching his files, convinced that Matthew was among the
interviewees &UR; 15 &LR;  who didn't make it into the final version of his
documentary about Jesse Helms, ``Dear Jesse,'' which Cinemax &UR; 16 &LR;  is
showing in its ``Reel Life'' series in January. ``I was sick of
seeing this split-rail fence everywhere,'' said Kirkman &UR; 14 &LR;  this
week, as he described his ultimately successful effort to unearth
his 1996 video of an unbrutalized &UR; 17 &LR;  Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkman &UR; 14 &LR;  let me view the tape _ which will now be used in a
new epilogue to his film and should air on a TV news magazine soon.
It's very brief. But it's easy to understand why the director
starts to cry when talking about it. Matthew, at the time studying
acting at Catawba &UR; 18 &LR;  College in Salisbury &UR; 19 &LR; , N.C., is just
another slight, soft-spoken underclassman on campus, politely
stopping to answer a stranger's questions about Sen &UR; 20 &LR; . Helms and
politics. But he's standing beside another student, who identifies
himself as Matthew's boyfriend and hugs him as he does so. Matthew
exudes an open American sweetness too. Asked by Kirkman &UR; 14 &LR;  if he
thinks Jesse Helms' homophobia &UR; 21 &LR;  ``represents what most of North
Carolinians &UR; 22 &LR;  feel,'' Matthew answers instantly and generously:
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   He is surely right. Most Americans, in North Carolina or Wyoming
or anywhere else, don't hate gay people. The countless vigils for
this murdered student in nearly every corner of the nation,
bringing people of all ages, political parties, sexual orientations
and religious affiliations together in genuine grief, speak for
themselves. But the fact remains that there are political
organizations in this country, led by moneyed, hard-nosed
tacticians posing as theologians, that are recklessly dedicated to
fomenting fear of gay people to scare up angry voters in an
election year like this one. Should you call them on their game,
they wrap themselves in the mantle of ``love'' _ they ``love the
sinner,'' you see _ and attack their critics as
Christian-bashers &UR; 23 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote last week about the latest efforts of these groups
to stigmatize gay people, the response was true to form. Gary
Bauer, the aspiring Republican presidential candidate from the
Family Research Council, took to the pages of a weekly Focus on the
Family newsletter to assail me for trying to ``silence''
Christians, and to vow that he would continue his ``Truth in Love''
campaign to convert homosexuals to the path of heterosexual truth.
He wrote a similar letter to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the spin. Go to the Family Research Council's Web
site and you will find ``homosexual activity'' described _
lovingly, no doubt _ as ``lethal and immoral behavior'' unworthy of
civil rights protection. Or turn to the October issue of Focus on
the Family's slick magazine, Citizen _ these organizations have
publishing empires to rival Conde Nast _ and its article
proselytizing for the ``ex-gay'' movement. It tells the story of a
father, Glen Hysom &UR; 24 &LR; , who learns that his son, Tim, is gay.
Recalling his anger at this revelation, Hysom &UR; 24 &LR;  is quoted as
saying that he considered blowing his brains out and blowing his
son's brains out. He goes on: ``But I knew that would hurt all of
us, too. So, `I'll just go blow that guy's brains out that got
[Tim) into the homosexual lifestyle &UR; 25 &LR; . That'd &UR; 26 &LR;  solve it all.'
Well, then I'd go to prison. So I couldn't do any of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``happy'' ending immediately follows _ Tim is said to have
been healed by an ex-gay ministry, his brain purportedly intact _
but the subtext is clear. The only reason presented for not blowing
out the brains of ``that guy'' who allegedly enlisted Tim into
homosexuality is that you'd ``go to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Want some more love? The Rev. D. James Kennedy's Coral Ridge
Ministries, another sponsor of the ex-gay campaign, is on record
saying ``Adult sex with children has been a crucial component of
the homosexual movement all along.'' And then there's my mail of
the past week. ``Here comes Rich galloping to the rescue of
fags &UR; 27 &LR;  again,'' wrote one of my many loving correspondents.
``This Matthew guy had the devil beat out of him and now his soul
is free for redemption, if possible.'' I guess I should be grateful
to this prayerful reader for showing me the light.

SUNSET'S GARDEN CHANGES WITH THE TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time was when a well-equipped back yard included a
rickety barbecue grill and a cluster of equally rickety lawn chairs
on a slab of concrete perched on the edge of a wide expanse of
lawn, with bowls of onion dip at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. Southern Californians may still devour chips and
dip, but today they want more convenience than they did decades
ago, more comfort, more permanence from whatever land surrounds
their homes. And at the same time, they want to be kinder to the
environment, more respectful of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why venerable Sunset magazine, which in the 1950s
defined what outdoor Western living was all about, has done a
complete overhaul of its 42-year-old, 1.5-acre Demonstration Garden
at the 127-acre Arboretum of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed since the '50s,'' said Sunset's senior
garden editor, Kathleen N. Brenzel. ``And this garden really
reflects how we live in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   The original garden _ closed a year ago to begin reconstruction
_ had lots of decks, patios and other structures separated by wide
swaths of lawn and plants that required lots of water and lots of
tending. The new garden, which reopens Nov. 2, relies more heavily
on plants and trees than on man-made features. It also reflects
modern concerns about water conservation, recycling and the use of
drought-tolerant and native plants.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT WORLDS
</P>
<P>
   Included are eight new planting areas designed by seven local
landscapers who won an extensive competition conducted by Sunset.
Water features _ all using recirculating water _ range from a
formal garden with a lily pond to a water garden to a deck garden
with two fountains. There's even a water feature with no water: a
dry creek bed reminiscent of the mountains near Big Bear.
(Actually, an underground system of pipes serves as a drain so the
garden won't be inundated during a heavy rainstorm.)
</P>
<P>
   Everything is touchable, open to close-up inspection and
exploration via paths and stepping stones. Or visitors can just
perch on a bench or a rock and enjoy the scenery in the shade of
tall sycamore or pine trees left over from the original garden.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike every-blade-of-grass-is-perfect expanses of
gardener-tended greenery, nothing is beyond the means of the
average Southern California gardener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an achievable garden you can get ideas from,'' Brenzel
said. ``We hope people will come in with cameras and note pads and
start finding things they can use. We want people to look at this
and say, `I can do this! I can do this this weekend!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Williams of Tarzana, who designed both the entertainment
garden and the formal courtyard garden, said he wanted to make the
areas easy for people to live with as well as pleasant to look at.
</P>
<P>
   READY TO GRILL
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment garden centers around a built-in gas barbecue,
sink, tiny refrigerator, storage area and a separate,
Southwestern-style fireplace. A backdrop of distressed wood beams
was built with materials saved from a house once owned by the late
movie director John Huston. The built-in components actually appear
hewn from rock, nestled among ``boulders'' made from polystyrene
pellets and concrete. Plantings are succulents and native plants,
some popping through chinks in the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, a wall of man-made ``stone'' encloses a serene
garden, punctuated by a towering fireplace and centered by an oval,
above-ground pool filled with water lilies, reeds and other plants.
In the center of the pool, an eternal flame burns _ just to add
extra interest, said the designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be off a dining room, or in the center of a
house,'' Williams said. ``You're able to enjoy the garden whether
you're in it or just looking at it through a window or a set of
French doors. And the fireplace makes it so you can stay outside
later in the evening, even if it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   One section of the garden uses bark, rock and native plants to
show the best way to garden beneath Southern California's
ubiquitous oak trees. Another shows how a new recycled plastic
material called Trex can substitute undetectably for wood in a
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Another garden is most like the one Midwestern transplants are
familiar with: a tiny swath of lawn ringed with rose bushes and
perennials.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER THE TREES
</P>
<P>
   Still another re-creates a mountain woodland, with a dry creek
bed, a half-dozen fledgling redwoods and a rough stone bench that
looks like it was cobbled together by park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Armstrong of Monrovia, who with partner Richard Walker
designed and executed the mountain woodland garden, said they
designed a haven much like mountain clearings they've visited while
hiking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it's kind of relaxing and meditative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration garden is in its final days of construction,
but by opening day it will also include a water garden with shady
seating area, a native plants garden, pergolas (arbors covered with
trailing plants) and an educational center where visitors can pick
up gardening information or see planting demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the grand opening is staged, sometime next spring,
the plants will be well-rooted and the flowers blooming, drawing
visitors eager for a sight of color, said Arboretum superintendent
John Provine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many people come to the Arboretum just to
see the Sunset garden, but we know it's popular,'' he said. ``And
when they finish, it'll be terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of sprinkler systems, drainage, paving and other
permanent features of the new garden was shared by Sunset magazine
and the Arboretum, while the designers and gardeners donated plants
and labor.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a labor of love. Armstrong said designers will continue
to help with each garden's upkeep, replacing plants as they die and
celebrating those that grow lush and luxuriant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it'll be here for years and years and that people will
enjoy it for a long time,'' she said. ``This isn't like some design
house, where you yank everything out and take it home after a
weekend. This is so exciting because it's permanent.''

SIERRA CLUB PLAYS HARDBALL POLITICS VIA ISSUE-ADVOCACY ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., N.Y., Nev., Calif., Wis., Mo., Hawaii, Ill., Wash.,
Colo.)  (Also moved in ``a'' news file) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last spring and summer, officials at the Sierra Club gathered
for a series of confidential meetings to plot how to make the
environment an issue in elections around the United States. But
their deliberations often had little to do with such matters as
polluted streams or global warming. Instead, they focused on
political tactics _ which candidates to help and which to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who has often been denounced by
environmentalists, would be a target; his own hog farm was said to
be a big polluter. Another Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., appeared less vulnerable. ``The problem with D'Amato is he
doesn't do a lot of dumb things,'' the group's media consultant
said. They decided to help Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. _ until he
crossed them by voting the wrong way on an environmental bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club officials insist that they do not play politics.
Their advertising, they say, simply seeks to educate voters about
issues. In the last two years, however, the Sierra Club has spent
more than $6 million to make itself heard in 15 House and 8 Senate
contests. And it is just one of dozens of interest groups spending
millions on advertisements that dodge campaign finance laws and
prohibitions on political activity by being labeled ``issue
advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the AFL-CIO to the Republican and Democratic parties, from
the health care industry to groups of religious conservatives, the
advertising has proliferated to the degree that some candidates
complain that they have lost control of their own messages. This
year, independent groups are spending at least $260 million to
press their issues in television advertisements, twice the amount
they spent in 1996, according to a study by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   While the din of the Clinton scandal in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation has led some groups to spend relatively less on
television this year and more on get-out-the-vote campaigns, the
commercials are more prevalent than ever; in many cities they have
dominated the airwaves over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club made possible a case study of this important new
phenomenon by allowing a reporter to attend its strategy meetings
and to examine its internal memorandums over several months. The
result shows that even groups like the Sierra Club, known to many
people for its scenic calendars and nature books, can play politics
as ferociously as any other interest group.
</P>
<P>
   With 550,000 dues-paying members, the Sierra Club is the
nation's oldest and largest grass-roots environmental organization.
Of its annual budget of $42 million, $12 million is devoted to
lobbying and policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   In strategy meetings week after week, Sierra Club officials made
no secret of their goal: helping to elect Democrats with solid
records on the environment _ it is backing only two Republicans,
both moderates _ and to defeat their foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be even more focused in choosing places where we
want to attempt to unseat anti-environmental opponents, and spend
significant resources per race to do so,'' the club's political
director, Daniel Weiss, wrote in a memorandum to his bosses on
Sept. 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The club has a political action committee, which spends some
money on direct political advertising in about a half dozen races.
But its efforts overwhelmingly involve the more subtle ``issue
ads,'' which escape federal election regulations and spending
limits by not expressly endorsing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is so concerned that it not be perceived as
exploiting election laws that it periodically issues staff
memorandums on what constitutes a legitimate issue ad. One advised
what to tell reporters who ask, ``Are you trying to influence this
political race?'' The recommended answer: the club's objective is
``to educate the public about the votes of our elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups are prohibited from contacting campaigns about
issue advertisements on their behalf. But the Sierra Club's
strategy is clearly to complement campaigns' own efforts. In
California, the club broadcast ads in May promoting the record of
Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, before her campaign began
advertising, allowing her to conserve her resources.
</P>
<P>
   Besides commercials, the Sierra Club has begun issuing 1 million
voter guides promoting candidates in pivotal races around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is really to roil the waters,'' the Sierra Club's
outside media consultant, Kim Haddow, said after one strategy
meeting. ``There's a big shrug out there. But we believe because
we're out there in their faces, the saliency of this issue will
rise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's decisions on where to channel its money are
far more complicated than simple questions about which candidates
most support its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this year, officials at the club's headquarters in
San Francisco spoke on conference calls with their political staff
members in Washington, often debating practical considerations:
which candidates needed their help and had a reasonable chance of
winning; which contests offered opportunities to have an impact,
which regions had strong Sierra Club field operations.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, for example, officials agreed that Faircloth should
be aa target because of his hog farm. The club's associate
political director, Chris Norman, said: ``All the pundits here say
Faircloth looks vulnerable. He has a huge pig farm and he has a
deplorable rating'' on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``The only problem is the local chapter is not as
sophisticated as we'd like.'' The club decided to produce an
advertisement anyway, focusing on river pollution in North Carolina
and mentioning Faircloth's farm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senator's general counsel in Washington, Sean Callinicos,
said the Sierra Club had overblown a minor incident on the farm
when ``cattle feed spilled into a creek as a result of vandalism
from a disgruntled employee.'' The ad was no surprise, he said,
because ``the Sierra Club is simply part and parcel of the D.C.
Democratic establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Weiss, the political director, and Ms. Haddow, the outside
media consultant, usually had the most to say about the broad
political landscape, the club's top officials often deferred to
staff members in the field to tell them how races looked.
</P>
<P>
   One who got his way was the Midwest field director, Carl
Zichella, who in midsummer sent an e-mail to several officials to
head off the Washington staff, which wanted to pull back from
aiding Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., opposed by Rep. Mark Neumann,
a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early soft polling has lulled some folks into a sense of
complacency about the Neumann-Feingold race,'' he wrote. ``THIS IS
VERY DANGEROUS. I believe that Senator Feingold is threatened by
low turnout and easy access to campaign resources from right-wing
contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing fresh polls that showed the race tightening, the
group relented, agreeing to finance two more weeks of ads to help
Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Sierra Club acts purely out of concern _ or
distress _ about a candidate's votes. In July, Ms. Haddow urged her
colleagues to cut back plans to help Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., in a
tough re-election fight. He had just voted for a bill that could
make it easier for developers to evade local planning regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said, ``I would rather spend the money on someone who is
with us other than Harry Reid.'' The officials, saying it was the
latest of several disappointing votes by Reid, then canceled three
weeks of radio advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club tries to stay flexible enough to make
last-minute adjustments. Early in the year it had high hopes in
Missouri for Attorney General Jay Nixon, a Democrat running for the
Senate against Republican incumbent Christopher Bond. But in
midsummer the group shelved $17,260 from the race _ a week's worth
of radio ads _ after concluding that Nixon was waging a lackluster
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond seems like a no-brainer,'' Ms. Haddow said of the
decision to not help Nixon. She added that the incumbent's record
on the environment had improved ``because we've been whacking on
him'' in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Nixon, Allen Mattison, acknowledged that the
campaign had had problems. ``It's a very different race now than it
was five months ago,'' he said. Asked if he was disappointed that
the Sierra Club had decided to be less active, he said, ``The
Sierra Club members that I've seen have been very active here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials regularly looked for races where they could trim
budgets to conserve resources for tighter contests later in the
season. While Representative Neil Abercrombie was ``in big
trouble'' in Hawaii, Weiss and Ms. Haddow wrote, there was ``little
marginal utility'' in buying a fourth week of radio advertising.
The savings: $9,750.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the conversations were courteous. But at one session
Bruce Hamilton, the club's conservation director, complained
bitterly that his staff members seemed too quick to rejigger
spending priorities to conform to the latest polls or conventional
wisdom about a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very demoralizing to put the money out and to be
constantly changing signals,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   At a strategy meeting this summer, Weiss excitedly told his
colleagues about an idea for a ad to help Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill.,
who is being challenged by a Republican, Mark Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local organizer has actually found someone who's gotten
sick from drinking water contaminated by a hog farm,'' Weiss said.
``This person's story sounds fabulous! It would be great to get
this girl on camera because we'd have a human victim instead of a
dead fish, which is already in the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl could be used to personalize the danger that large hog
farms pose to public water supplies, Weiss said _ and to make the
point that Evans has worked to clean up his district's waters.
</P>
<P>
   It was too good to be true. The girl, it turned out, did not
live in Evans' district. And, Weiss said, ``We decided that didn't
want to seem like we were exploiting a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club has hardly been timid about spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars to attack its opponents. Last
December the organization commissioned focus groups in five states
to help develop messages for its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   One of its biggest targets is Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., who is
aggressively challenging Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to hold Linda Smith accountable on water and
salmon,'' the director of the Northwest regional office in Seattle,
Bill Arthur, announced at a meeting in July. ``She is consistently
wrong on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club decided to focus on Ms. Smith's support for a
bill it says was intended to remove the ability of local
governments to protect salmon and limit suburban sprawl. To avoid
being accused of being political, the group likes to refer to
pending legislation in issue ads; in this case, a vote was pending
in Congress on budget bills that included money for enforcing clean
water laws.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Haddow and Weiss, back in Washington, D.C., entered
an editing studio to assemble the 30-second advertisement, they
spent much of their time looking for evocative pictures of salmon
and polluted water _ and scouring an illustrated field guide to
salmon to make sure they had the right fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people saying, `You guys don't know what you're
talking about,''' Weiss said, looking through the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haddow also said that to be most potent, the ad should give
viewers ``a sense of place.'' So she rejected a video clip of coho
salmon because the guide said Coho are not generally found in
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   They found footage of other salmon, but were not certain of the
type. ``They look like sockeye,'' Ms. Haddow said, comparing the
salmon on an editing screen with the field guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're pink enough for sockeye,'' Weiss
replied.
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to another fish in the salmon family. ``Are you
sure that's not a tuna?'' Weiss asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's a chinook,'' Ms. Haddow insisted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they settled on footage of king salmon teeming
upstream, juxtaposed against shots of bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator says: ``The Columbia ... the Columbia Gorge ...
Puget Sound ... king salmon _ all are threatened by development.
But instead of helping our communities rein in the sprawl and
pollution that's threatening our water quality and wild salmon,
congresswoman Linda Smith voted to make it easier for developers to
bypass local land-use decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new approach, the Sierra Club ran the advertisement just
before Labor Day. Usually, the most effective advertising is in the
weeks before an election. But rates are much cheaper in the summer
and there are fewer competing ads, so Sierra Club officials figured
they could get more attention and afford more ads by going early.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Troyer, a spokesman for the Smith campaign, said the
advertisement obscures the fact that Ms. Smith has ``a tremendous
record of balancing environmental votes and property rights
votes,'' and added: ``These attack ads are based upon partisan
politics. They selected competitive races where they can have an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible downside of the early advertising in Washington is
that the Senate race has not become as close as Sierra Club
officials expected. But the club maintains that its early ads
helped Senator Murray solidify her support among people who care
deeply about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sierra Club's advertising is over, but in Boulder,
Colo., the club has been broadcasting an ad over the past two weeks
with the goal of influencing one of the most competitive races in
the country, for the open seat in Colorado's 2nd Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to advertise in Boulder followed an unexpected
opportunity: the Republican candidate, Robert Greenlee, a wealthy
businessman and City Council member, was scheduled to vote in the
City Council on an environmental measure. That pending legislative
action enabled the Sierra Club to run an issue ad attacking
Greenlee's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of helping us protect our quality of life,'' the
announcer says as images of traffic jams and exhaust fill the
screen, ``City Councilman Bob Greenlee has voted against plans that
would have reduced traffic congestion, eased air pollution and
protected our open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of about $50,000, the effort was not as large as some
in other states, and does not appear to have significantly shifted
the campaign to environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democratic candidate, Mark Udall, a state legislator
and avid mountain climber who is being outspent by Greenlee, said
he was thrilled to learn of the Sierra Club's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate their help,'' said Udall, the son of Morris
Udall, a longtime Arizona congressman who sought the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1976. ``I like the fact that they point
out how strong I am on the environment _ I need to get that message
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlee angrily accused the Sierra Club of twisting his record
and masquerading its efforts to damage his campaign behind the
label of ``issue advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me, to everyone, that the Sierra Club has
gone beyond the boundary of a nonprofit group,'' Greenlee said in
his office in Boulder as he brandished a Sierra Club flyer that
compared his record with Udall's. ``They're trying to push an
agenda and a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from the objective comparison of records that is required by
law, Greenlee said, the flyer was ``clearly a campaign piece.''
</P>
<P>
   It is often difficult to determine just what impact a Sierra
Club campaign, or that of many advocacy groups, has in an election.
The groups' efforts rarely can be credited with shifting the
dynamic of a race. But the club's efforts can help put its
opponents on the defensive and, at the least, draw publicity in the
local news media.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss cites anecdotal evidence, like the fact that Matt Fong,
Boxer's Republican opponent in California, took a river rafting
trip after the Sierra Club ran an ad to help Ms. Boxer. He also
took credit for D'Amato's recent testimony at a hearing on acid
rain, saying he was spurred on because ``we've been beating on
D'Amato since April'' in ads.
</P>
<P>
   In the Colorado race, Greenlee said he feared that the Sierra
Club's campaign could cost him votes among swing voters that are
crucial in this election. ``It may have an impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than run advertisements countering the Sierra Club,
Greenlee said he planned to ignore it unless he appeared to be
losing significant support because of the effort. ``It's probably
better not to play into it,'' he said. ``You'd have to have the IQ
of a houseplant to do that.''

FOR MIDWESTERN REPUBLICANS, TIMES ARE GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ind., Mo., Ohio, Ill., Wis., Iowa, Mich.)  (Also moving in ``a'' news file) 
(mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ These are flush times for Republicans in the
Midwest and Mike Johanns is not being shy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are within days of recapturing the governor's office,''
Johanns, the Republican candidate for governor in Nebraska, crowed
to a luncheon of the Benson Women's Republican Club in a church
basement on the north side of Omaha. As for the other state and
federal offices, he asserted, ``If we do our job right, we'll have
a clean sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   If the polls are any gauge, he is probably right. In the latest
poll, Johanns leads his opponent, Bill Hoppner, by 20 percentage
points in their race to replace Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat who is
barred by law from seeking a third term. Republicans are expected
to easily retain all three of the state's congressional seats; in
fact, there is no Democrat running in the 3rd Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   In state races, the Democrats are running no candidates for two
seats on the Nebraska Public Service Commission, which regulates
phone service, and the Democratic candidate for state attorney
general was chosen by the party only after no candidate made the
filing deadline and a write-in candidate declined to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the governor's office, it's up and down the
line,'' said Dr. Robert Sittig, a political science professor at
the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. ``The Democrats _ they're
really going to get hosed this time in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seen better days in much of the Midwest. Only
Nebraska, Indiana and Missouri have Democratic governors. And
Republicans are considered likely winners in at least seven of the
nine governors' races in November.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control 14 of the 23 legislative chambers in the
12 states. (Nebraska's unicameral Legislature is nonpartisan.)
Democratic Senate seats in Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin are
considered vulnerable and Democrats are in tough races to retain
congressional seats in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwestern Republicans have done much better in the 1990s
than they did in the 1980s,'' said John Green, director of the
Bliss Institute, a nonpartisan political research institute at the
University of Akron. ``These folks have been able to take their
program down to the state legislatures. Even when they don't win,
they're kind of the dominant force politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, especially since Republicans took control
of Congress in 1994, the party's influence has grown stronger and
deeper in nearly every Midwestern state, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   They say Midwestern Republicans have crafted a different strain
of elected official. Drawing on the plain-spoken, no-nonsense
Midwest ethos _ and realizing that to win they have to play to
urban centers like Cleveland and Detroit _ these politicians are
seen as pragmatic and moderate, focusing more on fiscal and
administrative issues and less on ideological ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwestern Republican parties are much more moderate than
the party at large and than the South,'' Green said. ``They tend to
stay away from issues that you can't compromise on: abortion, gun
control, gay rights. Some of these Midwestern Republicans are kind
of uninspiring people. They are really managers rather than
ideologues. You ask them where are the big policy changes and they
just give you a blank look _ `This is the big policy change. We're
running the government well.'''
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans are not only interested in running government
efficiently, but in using the government to implement policy,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin has been the nation's most
aggressive governor on welfare reform, an issue that has also been
seized by Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Gov. George Voinovich of
Ohio. And Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois and Gov. Terry Branstad of
Iowa have tried to convince more conservative Republican
legislators to increase education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't conservatives who don't want to do anything,''
said John Bibby, a political science professor at the University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee. ``They want to solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican candidates for statewide office in the Midwest
seem to fit the more moderate mold. In the Kansas gubernatorial
primary, Gov. Bill Graves defeated a candidate backed by the
conservative Christian right. Johanns, the mayor of Lincoln, Neb.,
who describes himself as a ``pragmatic conservative,'' defeated two
more conservative opponents in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican state senator
who is ahead in the polls against Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.
Experts believe his conservative views would make victory difficult
if it weren't for a series of political and personal missteps made
by Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Democrats say Republican efforts to embrace more
moderate constituencies, and their ability to preside over the
recent booming economy, have made it difficult for Democratic
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough difference between me and Bill Graves to
motivate moderate Republicans to vote for me,'' said Jim Slattery,
a former Democratic congressman from Kansas who ran unsuccessfully
for governor in 1994 against Graves. ``That's the problem that
Democrats are running into. If you drift to the right or the left,
there isn't much room in there before you drift into the danger
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it seems no accident that in Indiana, Evan
Bayh, the Democratic former governor who is given a solid chance of
winning the race for Senate, uses the word ``conservative'' several
times in his advertising and does not mention the word
``Democrat.'' In Illinois, the Democratic nominee for governor,
Rep. Glenn Poshard, with his opposition to abortion rights and some
gay rights issues, as well as his past votes against gun control,
has been accused of being more conservative than the Republican
candidate, Secretary of State George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   James Reichley, a professor of political science at Georgetown
University, said that with the decline in Midwest Democratic
machine politics and as cities sprawl further into the suburbs,
Democrats ``can't rely on those bases like they used to, in cities
like Detroit and Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   An extreme example of a weakened Democratic Party, he said, is
playing out in Michigan, where Geoffrey Feiger, the iconoclastic
and abrasive lawyer for Jack Kevorkian, won the Democratic primary
for governor even though party leaders did not endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, the Republican ascendancy did not happen overnight.
Registered Republicans in the state have long outnumbered
Democrats, but Sittig said there has been such a strong Republican
surge in the past few years that there are now about 125,000 more
registered Republicans than Democrats. Republicans have even pulled
ahead in Douglas County, which includes Omaha and has been the most
reliable source of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And registered Republicans now seem more likely to vote
Republican. Over the years, Nebraska, proud of its
independent-minded voters, has elected many Democratic governors
and senators. But in 1996, Chuck Hagel, a Republican businessman
and political newcomer, won a race for the U.S. Senate against Gov.
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason we've seemed to always elect Democrats,''
said Kerry Winterer, chairman of the Douglas County Republican
Party. ``Historically we've always had this populist streak and
frankly, I think that's what changed. Republicans have done a
better job of trying to get people to identify with parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob Kerrey and former Sen. Jim
Exon, said he was confident, polls notwithstanding, that Nebraskans
would continue voting for Democratic governors. ``There's more and
more Nebraskans that understand what my background is and what I'm
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Boyle, chairman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said
it has been difficult for Democrats to raise enough money to
campaign across a large rural state. She also believes, she said,
that Republicans have managed to win the votes of anti-abortion
Democrats. Ms. Boyle said she was trying to re-energize the party
and noted that Democrats have historically been able to unseat
Republican governors after just one term.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, there is even talk about whether Nelson,
considered a conservative Democrat, will switch parties. Nelson,
who is believed to be toying with another run for the Senate in
2000, says he did not start the speculation. But he is not
discouraging it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very careful not to rule anything in or rule
anything out,'' Nelson said.

   WASHINGTON _ He was drawn and pale, left bald by repeated
courses of chemotherapy. He had no substantive inducements to offer
the Israelis or the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all the parties to the negotiations said, King
Hussein of Jordan, the longest-serving leader in the Middle East,
played a critical role in bringing the two sides together. It was
the latest and perhaps one of the final chapters in his long
history of coaxing the Arab world and Israel to accommodation if
not peace, and it cast him as conscience to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The king's ``courage, commitment, wisdom and frankly, stern
instruction at appropriate times were at the heart of this
success,'' President Clinton said at the signing ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded us of what rises above the facts, the arguments,
the legitimate interests, even the painful sacrifices involved,''
Clinton said of the Jordanian leader, who joined the talks after
finishing a round of cancer treatments at the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota last weekend. ``He was the living embodiment of the best
of our past and the brightest of our hopes for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The king, who is 62 and has ruled Jordan since 1952, had
delivered an emotional plea to the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations on Thursday evening, and repeated the same message
publicly Friday at the White House as Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, prepared to
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The king joked about the loss of his hair and eyebrows to
chemotherapy, and said that although many people have written him
off because of his illness, his morale is the best it has ever
been. He has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and just completed the fourth
of six scheduled rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to
be there and to help in any way I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quarrel, we agree, we are friendly, we are not friendly,
but we have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or
narrow-mindedness the future of our children or their children's
children,'' the king said, turning to face Netanyahu and Arafat.
``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste,
and it's time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our
peoples, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of
the children of Abraham _ Palestinians and Israelis coming
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who witnessed the 1951 assassination of his
grandfather, King Abdullah, by a Palestinian who feared that Jordan
was about to make a separate peace with Israel, said Friday's
agreement would not bring an end to violence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that such a step as is concluded Friday will
inevitably trigger those who want to destroy life, destroy hope,
create fear in the hearts and minds of people, trigger in them
their worst instincts,'' the king said. ``Let's hope that the
overwhelming majority of us, those who are committed to the future,
those who know what responsibilities they hold now, will be able,
through steady progress and a determined joint combined effort, be
able to thwart their aims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has long played a critical role in efforts to bring
peace to the region, and was involved in each of the last several
breakthroughs. But he came to his role as peacemaker after fighting
Israel, violently expelling the Palestine Liberation Organization
from Jordan in 1970 and opposing the United States in the Persian
Gulf war. And he has had a tense relationship with Netanyahu, whom
he said two years ago seemed intent on scuttling the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left the Mayo Clinic, the king received a visit
last Friday from Ariel Sharon, the hard-line Israeli foreign
minister. Then, as negotiations bogged down earlier this week, the
king joined the talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland at several
points, both in person and by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the king stood alongside Clinton at the White House, the
two of them flanked by Netanyahu and Arafat. And even Netanyahu
paid tribute to Hussein, saying the Jordanian leader's two
appearances at the Wye Plantation negotiations ``gave us an
unforgettable and inspiring example of courage and humanity, and it
moved me deeply.''

FLOODWATERS CREST, BEGIN SLOW DESCENT, AS HUNDREDS REMAIN

   WHARTON, Texas _ After cresting earlier than expected, the
Colorado River began a slow descent Friday, leaving many residents
thankful that the impact of the rain-swollen stream was far less
than had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hundreds of people remained displaced from their homes in
Wharton's west end, which took the brunt of the floodwaters that
had rolled downstream after heavy rains deluged Central Texas last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the city, about 55 miles southwest of Houston,
street flooding was the biggest problem. Officials said they knew
of no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing regret over the damage to an estimated 800
homes, Mayor Joel Williams said his city ``probably dodged a bigger
bullet'' with the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been worse, but we were helped by the fact that
that it wasn't necessary for anyone to release water upstream from
us and by the fact that our ditches and sloughs and creeks were
bone dry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, one part of our town has been devastated and
we're concerned for our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said those displaced by the flood would be housed in
the Wharton High School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Houston area, concerns began to ease as other
rivers and creeks reached their peaks or, like the Colorado, began
to slowly recede.
</P>
<P>
   The storms and floods have claimed at least 29 lives statewide
and left and thousands homeless. A Lockhart couple who left Galena
Park late Saturday never arrived home and still have not been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary damage estimates reached nearly $500 million in the
estimated 60 counties that have experienced flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Five more counties, all in southeast Texas, are being added to
the 20 already declared federal disaster areas, Federal Emergency
Management Agency Director James Lee Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   While many in Wharton found reason to be relieved Friday, there
also were many, such as Sandrea Holmes, who suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in my house has been flooded, and those are the
things I worked 21 years for,'' she said. ``I can replace my TV,
but I couldn't move my china cabinet or my bedroom set in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Colorado River Authority and the National Weather
Service at first believed the river would crest Thursday morning at
49 feet, 6 inches, but the time and peak level were continually
revised as the floodwaters moved downstream. The crest actually
came about 5 a.m. Friday at a foot lower.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that level easily broke the previous record of 46.1 feet,
set in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the river's level had dropped a fraction of an inch _
not much, but a welcome sight for folks who had watched it go up
for days. Officials predicted that the river will return to its
banks by 6 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although most public buildings were spared by the flooding,
Dawson Elementary School on the city's west end took on water, said
sheriff's Lt. Danny Marek. The extent of damage had not been
determined because the water had not receded late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton schools have been closed since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At least two major roads were closed in the Wharton area by high
water Friday: FM 961 from U.S. 59 to FM 960 and FM 442 at the Fort
Bend County line.
</P>
<P>
   Humans aren't the only ones suffering from the deluge and at
least eight dogs were rescued Friday from the city's west end.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just waited until the last minute to leave and they had
to scramble to save their things,'' said Animal Control Officer
Jackie Jurasek. ``Animals were just turned loose to fend for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurasek carried an undernourished dog through the high water and
fed her before placing her in a cage. ``She had a litter of pups,
but I didn't see them and I don't know what happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   One pooch literally leaped into the arms of an approaching
National Guard soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Mangum was among the residents who were surprised by the
depth of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been flooded twice, but I've never seen it this deep,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mangum, like another two dozen residents who parked outside
police barricades encircling the flooded area, was upset that he
could not go back and check on his home or his possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were strictly enforcing a 24-hour curfew within the
flooded area and denied entry to all but law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday afternoon, at least 244 people were in an El
Campo evacuation center, although officials hoped to relocate them
to a center closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Houston, it appeared Friday that most Brazoria County
and Fort Bend County residents would be spared any new heavy
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Valley Lodge subdivision have moved back into
their homes after keeping a close eye on the Brazos River. Simonton
Mayor Jim Gammill _ a resident of the riverside subdivision _ said
no homes took in water from the raging Brazos.
</P>
<P>
   Internal drainage work as well as volunteers who cleaned out
gutters and culverts helped stem the usual backup in the rural
subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river's gone down two or three feet,'' he said. ``The sun
is shining, and it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Where and when the Brazos crested in Fort Bend County is
difficult to say for sure, because gauges malfunctioned during the
week, officials said. While the river was not expected to crest in
Richmond until Friday, County Judge Mike Rozell said it apparently
crested at 46.9 feet Thursday night. Flood stage in Richmond is 48
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Still of concern were homes in the Oyster Creek Farms
subdivision in Missouri City. Flat Bank Creek had backed up and
invaded three houses.
</P>
<P>
   On the county's west side in the Tierra Grande subdivision
outside Needville, the San Bernard was returning to its banks and
the community was drying out Friday, Rozell said.
</P>
<P>
   People in Brazoria County also were optimistic that they would
be spared the record floods and damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really looking good,'' Rick Perry, assistant county
emergency management coordinator, said Friday afternoon. ``We're
starting to see daylight. We had some flooding, but nothing like
they had up north.''
</P>
<P>
   Information from the National Weather Service indicated that the
San Bernard would begin slowly dropping today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will stay above the flood stage until sometime next week,
but right now, we think it's peaked out and crested and everything
is pretty good,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the Brazos to stay high through the weekend
but to start a slow fall early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said low tides along the coast allowed rainwater to drain
off before the floodwaters from the north got downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water's getting out of here faster,'' he said. ``And I'm
just not sure there's as much water as we were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if you're one of the people who got flooded, you
might disagree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said flooding of buildings was limited to an area along
the San Bernard River near Sweeny in western Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Brazos, back up toward West Columbia, we had a few
county roads under, but they're nothing serious,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County officials by Friday afternoon did not expect
significant flooding along Oyster Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Like Perry, Texas prison officials were breathing easier Friday
as it became apparent that flooding would not force evacuations of
four prison units in Brazoria County. Inmates placed sandbags at
various spots around the prisons on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no threat to us at all right now,'' Ramsey III Unit
warden Jackie Edwards said at midafternoon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramsey I, Ramsey II and Ramsey III units are near Rosharon,
south of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said it appeared the Retrieve Unit near Lake
Jackson also would avoid flooding.

<P>
   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo
waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named
Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows
scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once children hid their adoption from friends, if they
even knew of it, adopted children today can belong to play groups
made up entirely of adopted children. They can buy storybooks about
being adopted, go to summer camps for children adopted from
particular foreign countries, and if they face emotional
difficulties, get treated by a therapist who specializes in
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, like New York, San Francisco and Boston,
playgrounds are peppered with parents of various races and
nationalities chasing children of other races. Many of those
families are headed by single people, people in their '40s or older
and gay people, men and women who, in years past, would have been
rejected as unsuitable adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas
highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls
abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's
one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children
orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by
their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal
state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, it became a kind of social phenomenon to adopt a
child from abroad. Last summer, Vanity Fair magazine quipped that a
Chinese baby was the season's hot accessory in the Hamptons. The
experience, however, is not limited to wealthy neighborhoods.
Suburban American and rural towns are also home to children adopted
from Shanghai, Murmansk, Guatemala City, Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rules on Privacy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Led to Secrecy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most profound change in the process of adoption is
the growth of the kind of open adoption that brought Nicholas to
his parents, the Weilackers.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War I, it was common for friends and relatives to
raise the child of someone they knew and for the biological parents
to be in touch with their children. But as the century progressed,
adoptive parents were paired with babies, mainly by doctors,
lawyers and social workers, most of whom sought a match of physical
traits that would allow parents and children to pass as a ``real
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The institutionalization, and the secrecy and the stigma, of
adoption were deepened after World War II by state laws requiring
that records to the event be sealed and new birth certificates
issued, listing the adoptive parents in place of the biological
ones. E. Wayne Carp, a professor at Pacific Lutheran University,
writes in his book ``Family Matters: Secrecy and Disclosure in the
History of Adoption,'' that initially, such confidentiality was
intended to protect those involved in an adoption from outside
scrutiny, but it later evolved into a way to keep all parties to an
adoption from one another.
</P>
<P>
   That change dovetailed with a postwar emphasis on the nuclear
family. In the 1950s, motherhood was glorified. For those unable to
conceive on their own, adoption was a blessing, one often kept
secret to mimic the wished-for idyll.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, social workers seized on a postwar embrace of
psychoanalytic theories _ which tended to view unmarried mothers as
disturbed, adoptees seeking information about their roots as
neurotic, and infertile people as unstable _ as a rationale for
keeping adoptive families and biological families apart.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, nobody imagined that adopting parents would
ever live with the expectant family in the final days of the
pregnancy, waiting for the contractions that would signal the
beginning of their new families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going through together blows me away,'' Mrs.
Weilacker said, soon after she arrived in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wait dragged on, drawn out by a doctor's inaccurate
calculating of Ms. Elniskey's due date, both women grew tense.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker, a court stenographer, was also anxious about
transcripts she needed to finish. Reluctantly, she returned to
California until the birth seemed more imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel a little lonely,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``I thought
we'd stick this out together and now Yvette gets to get away for a
while and I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, there seemed no relief. ``It's all I think
about,'' Mrs. Weilacker said. ``I love Kim and Jorge and their
kids. It was just all getting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A New Approach: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Easing the Curiosity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And Guilt in Adoption &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to rear their child, get to know them and then
stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to occasional
phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and emotionally
the other family's child. But people in the field say the trend of
open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was a logical time to try to coax adoption out of the
shadows. By the late 1970s, with the rise of the sexual revolution
and the women's rights movement, many in society were rejecting a
range of paternalistic institutions. Although in many places a
child born to unwed parents would still face scorn, in many places
he would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Traverse City social workers devised a plan in which they
asked prospective adoptive parents to put together a letter about
themselves with a picture and other information to be shown to
pregnant women, who would choose among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gritter and his colleagues have since taken the concept one step
further. In nearly all cases, the children handled by their agency
are born of parents in the region and adopted by parents in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same to be pen pals as it is to be part of a
clan,'' Gritter said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that open adoption is always a good option,
particularly workers at agencies whose birth mothers come from
cultures that still regard out-of-wedlock births with shame. In
addition, many parents who have adopted internationally say that
one reason they chose that route was to avoid being involved with a
birth family.
</P>
<P>
   Because the practice is still so new, researchers are only now
studying how these open relationships are working: Will a child be
hurt if a birth parent starts out involved but then withdraws? How
will a child feel if the woman who bore him has another child but
decides she can raise this one? And what if there is a falling out
between the birth parents and the adoptive parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people pressured into openness that
might not be in their best interest,'' said Beth Parsons, executive
director of El Paso Adoption Services. The agency places about 25
children a year, roughly 70 percent of them children of Hispanic
mothers, many of whom conceal their pregnancies from relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to birth mothers about what their options are, but
many do not feel emotionally ready for an open adoption,'' Ms.
Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the pregnant women choose parents themselves
from among the agency's files, most people who adopt through the El
Paso agency do not learn that they have a child until
relinquishment papers are signed, which cannot be done in Texas
until at least 48 hours after the birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the mothers to make their decisions without the
pressure of an adoptive family waiting outside the delivery room
door,'' Ms. Parsons said. She said she also wanted to protect
adopting parents from becoming attached to a woman and her unborn
baby in case the mother changes her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Parsons said, the move toward openness is positive
and she urges all birth mothers to give photographs, letters or
some memento to their child, a change from when the agency first
opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest shifts in adoption in recent years is this
emergence of birth mothers from the shroud of shame and dependence
that kept them from having any role in shaping their children's
futures. In fact, most parents who adopt domestically today _
whether in totally open adoptions or more closed ones _ engage in a
kind of courtship of birth mothers, preparing often elaborate
albums and letters aimed at persuading pregnant women to entrust
their unborn children to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see things through the eyes of this child,'' the
Weilackers wrote in their ``Dear Birth Mother'' letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother; I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to have his own life with them,'' Ms. Elniskey
said. ``I don't want to be in their way. But I want to know what's
going on. When he's old enough, he can come to me and ask what he
wants. But I want him to never have to wonder why I made this plan
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never will,'' Mrs. Weilacker assured.

<P>
   &UR; Hurtful Words, Even &LR;
</P>

<P>
   Despite these radically changed attitudes toward adoption,
parents and adoption professionals said that Nicholas can expect to
be asked by his friends and others why his ``real'' mother ``gave
him away.'' Even in the most cosmopolitan and adoption-saturated
cities, like New York, people still say callous things to adoptive
families.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a girl adopted from Korea said that the first week
she strolled with her daughter in Central Park, strangers
approached her and said: ``Oh, she'll be great at math!''
``Couldn't you have one of your own?'' ``Does she speak Chinese?''
</P>
<P>
   Ronny Diamond, director of post-adoption services at the
Spence-Chapin adoption agency in Manhattan, said that attitudes
toward adoption were similar in some ways to racial prejudice. ``If
you ask people if they are prejudiced, they would say, `No,''' Ms.
Diamond said. ``But if you put forth a scenario, the bias emerges.
For example, a teacher gets a class list and sees that three boys
are adopted. Often, they'll say, `This is trouble. This will be a
tough year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spence-Chapin offers advice to help teachers and administrators
focus on how they talk about adoption, the language they use and
the assignments they make.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent workshop, teachers were surprised at how clumsy they
had been in dealing with the issue and how easy it was to readjust.
Administrators at the school agreed to have a reporter present on
condition that the school not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diamond began by handing out a glossary showing the common
ways people talk about adoption and the more positive alternatives.
For example, instead of saying that a birth parent ``gave a child
away,'' it is better to say she ``made an adoption plan,''
reflecting the thought that goes into such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important shifts in language is to say that a
child ``was'' adopted, rather than ``is'' adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being adopted is an action that happens once and then you are
someone's child,'' Ms. Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   She also cautioned teachers against trying to comfort adopted
children by telling them that they were ``chosen.'' ``Think about
it,'' Ms. Diamond suggested. ``What is the opposite of chosen?
Rejected. To be chosen, a child might think he had to have been
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she went on, most adopted children are not chosen.
Implying that they are makes it seem like their parents walked down
a row of children in a pediatric supermarket and selected the
choicest offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption is not better,'' Ms. Diamond told the teachers.
``It's just not worse.''

   Diana Galligan, nearly 7, knows what adoption means. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the
new American family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a
family,'' said Galligan, 39, who works for the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several
years ago, Galligan, said, although he had no partner at the time,
he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Many states let single people adopt without their sexual
orientation being an issue. Some states allow one gay person to
adopt, then later and separately the other partner. But about half
the states do not allow a second parent of the same sex to adopt a
child, even at a later time. And in Florida and New Hampshire, it
is nearly impossible for homosexuals to adopt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Koonce and Galligan said that they thought such resistance to
adoptions by gay people would eventually wither.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is on the edge of creating a lot of new models for
work, family and community,'' said Koonce, 44, who owns his own
career counseling business. ``I look at myself. I have a
nontraditional model of work that's a far cry from what my father
did, working for the big company. I have what many people would
consider a nontraditional family, although we see ourselves as very
conservative and mainstream. I walk Diana to school; John picks her
up. On Teacher Appreciation Day, there I was with all the moms,
bringing a tossed salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Kathryn Creedy is stitching badges on a Brownie
sash or searching under a couch for a magic marker cap, she pauses
and reminds herself that, as real as being a mother feels to her, a
generation ago, she and her daughters _ Alexis, who is 8, and
Brooks, 5 _ would also likely not have become a family. Ms. Creedy
is a single woman.
</P>
<P>
   As the American family has assumed new forms, adoption agencies
have begun to look beyond stereotypes to find parents. Some
countries, it turned out, actually favored older parents and single
parents, reasoning that children would have such parents' full
focus. Single parents were also more willing to adopt older
children or children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ms. Creedy, a media specialist for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Washington, decided that, then 39 and unmarried,
the biggest regret in her life was that she was not a mother.
Initially, she tried to adopt a child out of foster care, but she
was turned down because she was single.
</P>
<P>
   She signed up with a private adoption agency near her home in
Alexandria, Va. While preparing to adopt a child from Guatemala,
news reports coming out of Eastern Europe pushed her to fly to
Rumania. After seven grueling weeks of scouring the bureaucracies
there, she returned home at last with a feisty 14-month-old girl
with laughing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's birth mother was desperate for her child to climb out
of the poverty engulfing the family. ``She would take Alexis and
point to me and say, `Mama, America,''' Ms. Creedy recalled. ``It
was so profound. We didn't speak the same language, but it was
clear she was saying to me, `You are the one I trust to be my
child's mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Ms. Creedy flew to Bolivia to adopt a
5-month-old girl, whose onyx hair and tawny skin set her apart from
her golden-haired, fair-skinned sister, and from her mother, who
describes herself as having ``turkey white skin.'' And yet,
together they are a family in every way: loving, argumentative,
affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' roots are a vibrant part of their identities. Each
year, each girl celebrates her ``Gotcha Day,'' the day she became a
part of the family. The day begins with the reading of ``life
books'' that Ms. Creedy prepared for each, with pictures, maps and
the tale of how their family came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis' book, which she now proudly reads herself, begins,
``Once upon a time there was a woman, who dreamed of having a baby
girl of her own to give her all the love she had stored up over her
lifetime. Her name was Mommy.''

<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, when she hears people talking about how
irresponsible birth parents are, she cannot help revealing herself.
``Usually, I really surprise them, because, to meet me, I'm the
girl next door,'' said Ms. Nicholson, who married last year and
hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible
decision. It's not easier, it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Saidman, who has a warm and open relationship with Linda
Dooley, the birth mother of her daughter, Sasha, said that
prejudices in society lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this image in the popular consciousness that
birth parents are these selfish, uncaring people who don't even
think twice about giving up their kids and yet, paradoxically, that
they are these evil people lurking in the shadows who are going to
come and snatch these children back,'' said Mrs. Saidman, 49, a
writer and management consultant. ``But it's just fear and
ignorance speaking. Linda is part of our lives, part of our family.
But I am Sasha's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Sasha's 6th birthday this August, Mrs. Saidman and
her husband, Perry, a 52-year-old design patent lawyer, invited Ms.
Dooley and her 22-year-old daughter, Keira, to drive up from their
home in Florida and stay with the family in their house in Wheaton,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time the extended clan had gotten together
since Sasha's birth. In between, there were e-mail exchanges,
letters, phone calls and a vacation in the Bahamas that Keira, a
college student, took with the Saidmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me is that Sasha is a great kid,
she has wonderful parents and she will never have to have any
self-doubts because any questions she has, she can ask me or she
can ask Susan,'' said Ms. Dooley, 42. ``The hardest part has been
when people who barely know me belittle me and my decision.'' &UR;

<P>
   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up air after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

<P>
   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo
waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named
Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows
scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to raise their child, get to know them and
then stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to
occasional phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and
emotionally the other family's child. But people in the field say
the trend of open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is no mystery for Diana Galligan, nearly 7. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the
new American family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a
family,'' said Galligan, 39, who works for the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several
years ago, Galligan, said, although he had no partner at the time,
he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, when she hears people talking about how
irresponsible birth parents are, she cannot help revealing herself.
``Usually, I really surprise them, because, to meet me, I'm the
girl next door,'' said Ms. Nicholson, who married last year and
hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible
decision. It's not easier, it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.
</P>

   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother, I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up gas after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

<P>
   MONTEREY, Tenn. _ In rural, rugged middle Tennessee, the race
for a state Senate seat has been altered by a single bullet, and
the surviving candidate in District 15 will watch the outcome from
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Burks, the popular incumbent Democrat who was expected to
win easily, is dead and buried. Burks, 58, was shot in the forehead
Monday at his 1,000-acre hog farm outside the little town of
Monterey, not far from his pumpkin patch.
</P>
<P>
   The crime left just one name on the ballot in the Nov. 3
election, that of the Republican challenger, Byron (Low Tax)
Looper, who was arrested Friday morning and charged with Burks'
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Because state law does not allow a dead person to appear on the
ballot, but does allow to a person charged but not convicted of a
felony to appear on it, only Looper's name will confront shaken
citizens when they enter the voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, negative television ads, name-calling and mud-slinging
do not seem so bad, people here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe,'' said Putnam County Executive Doug
McBroom, a Democrat who, like others in his party and an
embarrassed Republican Party, said they would support the write-in
candidacy of Charlotte Burks, the incumbent's widow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be a system of the people, for the
people,'' McBroom said. ``Something this bad, it strikes at the
heart of that system.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did it, they should string him up,'' said Patricia
Hassler, who owns an antique shop in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Looper, 34, who had his middle name legally changed from Anthony
to Low Tax to reflect his political philosophy, was in the
Cumberland County Jail Friday, awaiting an arraignment, as people
wondered whether simple politics was enough to motivate a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel real comfortable we've got the right person,'' said
Cumberland County Sheriff Butch Burgess, although he and other
investigators would not say what evidence they had linking Looper
to the crime, or what motive _ beyond political gain _ he might
have had.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one has an explanation, But people here said that
Looper's political career, though still new, had seemed
self-destructive from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Looper, the controversial Putnam County tax assessor who is
under indictment on charges of theft and misuse of office and is
the defendant in a paternity suit, was arrested about 1:15 a.m.
Friday by a deputy sheriff who had ben assigned to stake out his
home in Cookeville.
</P>
<P>
   Looper had last been seen Sunday night, the night before Burks'
body was found in the cab of his pickup truck, a small bullet hole
in his forehead. As late as Thursday night, investigators had
refused to call Looper a suspect, saying they only wanted him for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But around this part of the upper Cumberland, where Burks made
many friends and allies during three decades in politics, people
soon became suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   A dark blue car like the Chevrolet that Looper drives was seen
at the farm that morning, as Burks prepared his farm for a field
trip by a local elementary school. The children were coming to see
the pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   It was Looper's absence, more than anything, that made people
suspicious. Four days passed without a word from him. If he had
nothing to do with the crime, then why was he in hiding, people
here said they wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' said Monterey Mayor Jack Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure doesn't,'' said Clinton Wright, who was visiting with
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, like others here, wondered why Looper never called the
Burks family to offer sympathy. It was, people here said, bad
manners at the very least. Looper's lawyer, Lionel Barrett of
Nashville, was apparently the only person who spoke with him during
his absence. Barrett said he spoke with his client again Friday but
offered no insight into where he had been or why he had been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats _ and some Republicans who said they
disapproved of Looper's behavior in office _ drafted Mrs. Burks to
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write-in campaigns are hard,'' said Phillips, ``but I think
she can win.'' He, and others who know District 15 politics, say
they doubt Looper can be elected. Phillips has donated his mayoral
salary, all $500 of it for this year, he said with a smile, to Mrs.
Burks' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All over Putnam County, people wave placards at the roadside to
urge support for the write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Until the murder, it had not been shaping up as much of a race.
Looper's campaign attracted little attention, and there seemed no
bad blood between the candidates, people here said.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of there was the gray-haired Burks, who people here
say they cannot remember ever seeing in a suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd see him in his rubber work boots, after slopping his
hogs,'' Mrs. Hassler said. ``He was one of us. He was a good man,
probably the only honest one we had.''
</P>
<P>
   His politics, in the state House and Senate, sometimes put him
at odds with his own party, and sometimes aligned him with
Republicans. He fought against abortion and gambling, and for
victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   He made his most controversial stand two years ago when he
sponsored a bill that would have required the firing of teachers
who taught evolution as fact. The bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his district, he was far from controversial. Most
people thought as he did, Mrs. Hassler said. He voted their will,
she said.

 MONTEREY, Tenn.: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the other side was Looper, a candidate who, even before the
events of this week, seemed in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tennessee, he was a student at West Point until a knee
injury forced him to take an honorable discharge in 1985, the
Associated Press reported. He moved to Georgia, where he ran
unsuccessfully for the state Legislature at 23. He was a
legislative aide, then reportedly lived for a while in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   He won his job as tax assessor in what many people here
described as a a negative campaign two years ago, promising to
fight for lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But quickly his career was marked by accusations of scandal,
including charges that he had offered tax breaks to land developers
in return for political contributions. The accusations led to
Looper's indictment in March on charges of theft and misuse of
office _ charges he denied. He is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   When one developer turned down his offer, the indictment said,
he increased a tax assessment on the developer's parents.
</P>
<P>
   He is also being sued by a former girlfriend who said he
fathered her baby and once tried to transfer ownership of her home
to himself by faking a deed.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release after the woman filed suit, Looper said she
``left me with heart palpitations, a small box of memorabilia and a
red G-string.''
</P>
<P>
   His manner bothered many here. ``His attitude was that we're all
dumb, and he was here to save us,'' McBroom said. He talked down to
Democrats, and promised favors to his Republican constituents,
people here said.
</P>
<P>
   He fired employees and insulted co-workers, courthouse workers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was the smart one, but he kept getting caught,''
McBroom said.
</P>
<P>
   Looper said he was being persecuted because he was a Republican,
in a county dominated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Finding people to speak up for him is hard. One woman in
Cookeville acknowledged voting for him, but begged not to have her
name used in connection with him.
</P>
<P>
   His race for the state Senate seemed to make no sense. He ran
unopposed in the primary, because state Republican Party officials
did not believe anyone could unseat Burks. The party did not
endorse Looper because of his history, state party leaders said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, but unlikely, that he could win.
</P>
<P>
   Write-in candidates almost always fail, but voters said this is
an unusual case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she will win,'' said Phillips of Mrs. Burks, who has
had little to say publicly about her campaign. The voters, Phillips
and others here said, will vote their broken hearts, and their
outrage.

 &HT;    3 Atlanta jewelers honored
 &HT;    By Tim Pallesen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Atlanta jewelers who helped Palm Beach police crack their
biggest jewel heist will get the applause _ if not the promised
reward money.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Jones, Jeff Meyer and Shawn Slep matched jewels stolen
from heiress Kathleen Ford and pictured on the Internet by Palm
Beach police with jewels that the Ford thief's fence was trying to
sell in Atlanta. Ford's attorney had offered a $1 million reward
for their return.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, the county's Crime Prevention Officers Association
will honor the jewelers with an award for their alertness. The
jewelers did not get a reward, however, and have filed a lawsuit
against Ford for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard about this, we wondered if Mrs. Ford would be
flying her jet up to bring us the $1 million,'' Jones joked. She
won't. The jewelers will pay their own airfare to the award
ceremony, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford lost jewels valued at $12 million to $15 million in the
January 1997 burglary. Police recovered more than $8 million after
the Atlanta jewelers led them to Barry Marshall, who confessed to
receiving the jewels from burglar Alfaro Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez and Marshall were charged last month with stealing $25
million in jewels from Ford and 70 other wealthy South Florida
residents over four years. The pair were convicted on federal
charges in the Ford case earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Burglary victims continue to visit Palm Beach to view jewels
that police recovered from Valdez and Marshall.
</P>

 &HT;    No-cut policy strategized for national forests
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXEDO, N.C. _ Claiming that public opinion is on their side,
members of a controversial campaign to end all commercial logging
of America's national forests are meeting here this weekend to
discuss strategies for the South.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included calls to continue a campaign of suing the
Forest Service over specific timbering projects, as well as direct
lobbying of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at a mountain summer camp near here attracted more
than 100 activists, from white-haired grandfathers to pony-tailed
college students. It is being hosted by the Southern Appalachian
Biodiversity Project, one of several groups focusing on 4.5 million
acres of national forests in the Southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Begun a decade ago by splinter environmental groups frustrated
with the slow pace of change with the U.S. Forest Service, the
National Zero Cut Campaign in recent years has won the endorsement
of more mainstream organizations like the Sierra Club, as well as
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us for years have tried to make (timbering on
national forests) work, but the Forest Service keeps cutting old
growth, keeps going into roadless areas, keeps violating the law,''
Brownie Newman, director of the Western Carolina Alliance, told the
conference Friday. ``As long as there is money and politics
involved, as long as money can be made from logging our national
forests, our national forests will not be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But zero cut is not universally endorsed by conservationists,
many of whom say it is too radical for most Americans. The issue
threatens to divide environmentalists in their 20-year-old effort
to get the government to preserve more wilderness areas within 155
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we waste our precious time and energy on something
that ain't ever going to happen?'' said Brent Martin, director of
Georgia ForestWatch, who did not attend the conference. ``I say
let's concentrate on what we can achieve. Zero cut just will not
fly in the communities up here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South there are 30 federal forests, covering almost 13
million acres, or half the region's public lands. Almost two-thirds
are open to logging, with only 6 percent protected as wilderness. A
bill that would end the long-standing practice of government
selling timber to private companies was introduced by U.S. Rep.
Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) and Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) this past
session but did not make it out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey sponsored by zero-cut advocates earlier this
year reported that 69 percent of Americans oppose ``continuing to
allow timber companies to log our national forests.'' A similar
statewide poll conducted by Georgia State University found that 72
percent of Georgians oppose timbering of the Chattahoochee and
Oconee forests.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is becoming an autumn habit, New Yorkers
turned out Friday at their rapturous loudest and paid obeisance to
the conquering New York Yankees in a rollicking ticker-tape parade
up the Canyon of Heroes along lower Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Retracing a path shimmering with the ghosts of Ruth and Mantle
and Gehrig, the pinstriped World Series champions, astride blue and
white floats, were coated with a paper snowstorm by thick crowds of
euphoric fans as they crept along a one-mile route from Battery
Park to Chambers Street.
</P>
<P>
   The late-morning ride of concentrated affection was just as much
a testament to a primordial pastime that has reclaimed its spot in
the soul and hearts of fans. By producing a transcendent season of
superhuman feats _ the electrifying home-run chase, Cal Ripken's
conclusion of his seemingly endless iron man streak and the
Yankees' primrose march to a stupefying 125 victories _ baseball
mattered again. This year, at least, the animosity precipitated by
the players' strike and the ransomlike salaries commanded by
capricious athletes was all but erased by a luminous reaffiliation
with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of autumn brilliance, a day itself well suited for
baseball, if the Yankees had not cut short the season with their
quick World Series victory. Hundreds of thousands of clamorous fans
choked the sidewalks and mounted street lamps and traffic light
poles to see and salute a group of ballplayers who had not only won
a title but also performed on the field perhaps as no other team
ever has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees deserve this parade and more,'' said Fred Pilla,
21, an elevator mechanic from Stony Point, N.Y., who was basking in
the glow of his heroes. ``They gave New York the best season that
we will ever see. And God, do we thank them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilla, his face painted in Yankee pinstripes, was unperturbed by
the fragile state of his own employment. ``I called in sick to be
here, and I'm out of sick days,'' he said. ``I called in sick last
week when I was really sick and that was my last day. But I had to
be here. This was a date with history.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the special treats of the event was the emotional
appearance of Darryl Strawberry, whose encounter with colon cancer
had added a surge of inspiration to already inspired teammates. The
outfielder, sitting in a red Cadillac convertible, wore a ski hat,
sunglasses and his broad, magnetic grin. The cheers were long and
loud for the Yankee slugger, whose resolute confrontation with
adversity meshed well with the city's personality.
</P>
<P>
   By completing a dominating four-game sweep of the San Diego
Padres to claim their 24th World Series title in 75 years, the
Yankee players found themselves being honored with confetti (along
with printer sheets, shredded phone books and toilet paper) for the
second time in three years. In 1996, the championship came as a
marvelous surprise, after an unspeakably long interlude of 18
seasons and after an underdog Yankee team clawed its way back after
losing the first two games to overtake the intimidating Atlanta
Braves in six.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Yankees were the intimidators. Fans have been
anticipating this triumph practically from the day spring training
began. They've been all but lining up along the parade route since
July, when it was already obvious that their superior team, leaving
carnage in every city that it visited, would be still playing ball,
and winning, in October. There was the feeling this year that a
temporarily disrupted Darwinian order had been restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``After '96, I didn't think it could get any better,'' Joe
Torre, the team's manager, said at a City Hall reception that
followed the parade. ``But this is dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd estimates by city officials reached the usual dreamlike
proportions. Police said the crowd was in excess of 3.5 million,
the same figure arrived at by unknown mathematics after the 1996
parade. All that could be said with any exactitude was that there
were an awful lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children took an unscheduled holiday and forwent
school to watch the confetti ride. After all, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's own son, Andrew, was there, and the mayor himself made
it clear that he had no problem with low school attendance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Friday's choreographed pageantry, many fans expressed the
conviction that they now had empirical evidence that a dynasty
might well be in place, just like the Yankee teams of yesteryear,
just like the Chicago Bulls in basketball. There was the sense that
an October Yankee parade was going to become as regular as Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No one but the president of the United States, even
if burdened with other immense problems, could have kept Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat talking for nine days and eight nights
until they reached an agreement on land, law and security.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident, not because Vice President Gore said so, in an
introduction that could have passed for a campaign commercial. It
was true in spite of that.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate survivor of the Middle East peace process, King
Hussein of Jordan, put it most authoritatively when he said that he
had known every president since Dwight Eisenhower, ``but I have
never, with all due respect and all the affection that I held for
your predecessors, have known someone with your dedication,
clearheadedness, focus and determination to help resolve this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment probably came seven days into the talks, on
Wednesday when Clinton neither panicked nor raged when the Israelis
threatened to walk out. He did not rush out to the Wye complex from
the White House that night. Palestinians said that showed that
Netanyahu could not push him around. And Netanyahu may have had the
same moments in mind when he said Friday at the White House that
Clinton ``has this ability to maintain a tireless pace and to nudge
and prod and suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly
explore the possibilities of both sides, and never just on one
side.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a tradition, of course, that presidents do not inject
themselves into international negotiations until they are sure of
success. (That may be an impossible condition for the Middle East,
and it is one that Jimmy Carter ignored 20 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   The rationale has been that they dare not risk failure and lay
their prestige hostage to the calculations and passions of foreign
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. president runs a small risk compared to the threat of
death faced by leaders in Arafat's and Netanyahu's part of the
world. As recently as 1995 and as long ago as 1951, assassinations
aimed at thwarting peace killed an Israeli prime minister and a
king of Jordan, Hussein's grandfather. And even in political terms,
failure would have been seen as a result of the intractability of
the parties, not the ineptitude of their host.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River talks allowed Clinton to look presidential for
more than a week, while mostly remaining out of sight. All that
Americans saw of the president were television pictures of him
stepping into his helicopter to fly to the conference site and
official White House photographs of meetings with the visiting
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For seven of the nine days, though, Clinton acted as the
ultimate troubleshooter, summoned to take aside one or another
leader and use his presence as pressure for compromise. He
successfully persuaded Netanyahu, for example, to free more
Palestinian prisoners by explaining that this was as symbolic to
Arafat as the removal of the Palestinian commitment to destroy
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to exaggerate the accomplishments at Wye.
Basically, the Israelis and the Palestinians agreed on Friday to do
what they had promised to be finished with nearly 19 months ago _
taking interim steps toward ultimate, even more difficult agreement
on the final status of the region _ and of its capital, Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to anticipate short-term political gains
for any of the parties involved. Arafat and Netanyahu will face
hostility and even calls for their ouster from their right flanks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton skipped opportunities to do the only thing he seems able
to do for his party these days, to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The president's political aides were gnashing their teeth all
week while Clinton was out of sight. They said there was little
political profit from the president's immersion in the Mideast
peace process instead of capitalizing on his budget victory over
the Republicans. They would much rather he had been on the campaign
trail beating up on Republicans over taxes, schools, health care
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were undeniable opportunity costs from having him do
this rather than being out there campaigning,'' one senior White
House official said. ``I don't buy the theory that it's some big
catastrophe if it fails or there's any big bounce if it succeeds.
That's not why he's doing it. He's doing it because he wants to.
He's the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such comments are more than an occasion to sound noble.
</P>
<P>
   They reflect how little foreign policy, short of war, usually
affects U.S. politics. ``There is not much public interest one way
or another,'' said John Mueller, a political scientist at the
University of Rochester who has studied the effect of foreign
crises on U.S. public opinion. ``For most people, it's been going
on for centuries and will go on for centuries more.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the very short-term boost Carter got from the far more
remarkable Camp David success, Mueller said that Clinton would
likely see little effect on his domestic popularity from the Wye
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Like most second-term presidents with an eye toward a historical
legacy, Clinton has concentrated increasingly on foreign affairs.
The public lack of interest gives him more freedom, and in this
sphere he gets credit across party lines, from China to Ireland to
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And just as last week's budget deal proved to U.S. politicians
that a president wounded by the Lewinsky scandal could still
dominate domestic politics, this week's diplomatic success will
underscore the different way the rest of the world looks at him and
his problems with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To them, it matters far more that the president of the United
States can work with the Israelis and the Palestinians than that he
had an affair with an intern, covered it up and lied under oath.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Justice Department filed suit Friday to
block Northwest Airlines from buying a controlling stake in
Continental Airlines, arguing the plan would mean higher prices and
reduced air service in markets throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction involving Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest
carrier, and No. 5 Houston-based Continental would especially
hamper competition between seven ``hub'' cities where the two
carriers already dominate, Justice officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable, quality air transportation is critical to
consumers both in their personal lives and their businesses,'' Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust
Division, said in a written statement. ``This acquisition would
lead to higher ticket prices and worse service for the over 4
million passengers traveling on the routes dominated by the two
airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 3.6 million passengers travel between the seven cities
each year, spending $375 million on air fares. Continental and
Northwest, for instance, operate all of the non-stop flights
between Houston and Detroit; Houston and Minneapolis; and Houston
and Memphis, Tenn., Justice officials said in the suit filed in
U.S. District Court in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also is already the only carrier providing non-stop
flights between Memphis and Cleveland and Memphis and Newark, and
Continental is the most likely candidate to challenge that monopoly
position, Justice officials said. Add those cities, and even more
passengers are harmed, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Steenland, Northwest's executive vice president and
general counsel, said it had already agreed to a series of steps to
alleviate Justice Department objections. He said he was mystified
by what the Justice Department filed.
</P>
<P>
   Both carriers promised to fight the suit, saying that their
alliance will benefit consumers. Continental said travelers would
have more destinations and flights to choose from and receive
better service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that Justice has a very weak legal case, a very
weak factual case and a very week economic case,'' said Jeff
Smisek, Continental's executive vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Linking up, Northwest and Continental said, will promote
competition in the industry, as together they can better take on
the nation's Big 3 airlines: Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and
American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The three airlines are each about twice the size of Northwest or
Continental, Steenland said, adding that the alliance creates a
network of equal size.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northwest and Continental stressed that each would remain
separate and be competitors. Steenland said each would make its own
decisions about where to fly, capacity, schedules, new aircraft and
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to thwart a deal announced in January
for the Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest to buy the Class A voting
stock of Continental owned by Fort Worth-based Air Partners for
$300 million in cash and 4.1 million shares of Northwest stock. The
stock Northwest would buy represents 14 percent of the
Continental's ownership but carries 51 percent of its voting
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also said they would link their route systems and
plan a series of steps such as code-sharing, which is when one
carrier sells seats on another's flights under its name. They would
also make their frequent flier programs reciprocal, coordinate
ticket offices and allow corporate clients to negotiate deals with
them individually or together.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Justice Department filed suit against the
airlines over the equity transfer. The department also has
competitive concerns about the alliance aside from the stock deal
and continues its review. It didn't detail the concerns and the
airlines declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, did not seek a restraining order or a
permanent injunction to stop the equity transaction from moving
forward.
</P>
<P>
   So the airlines said they will go ahead with the stock sale and
other parts of the alliance, such as the code-sharing and frequent
flier plans. They expect the sale to be closed and the alliance put
into motion within weeks, if not days.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, said Smisek, could drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials said if the airlines finish the transaction
and then lose in court, the government would force Northwest to
sell its stake in Continental. In more typical merger cases in
which it objects, the government seeks an injunction to block
further action, since it is difficult to undo once companies
consolidate operations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the initial deal, Northwest was to place its
Continental stock in neutral voting trust for six years. After
that, Northwest would have faced no restrictions on how it voted
its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said to satisfy the Justice Department's concerns, it
agreed to a series of steps. Among them, Northwest said, is no
code-sharing on hub-to-hub markets. Also, for an additional four
years Northwest would only be able to vote its Continental shares
in very limited instances, including if Continental wanted to
liquidate itself or another company planned a merger with
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers said the Justice Department was acting now on the
concern that in a decade Northwest could gain control of
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice, if anything, is 10 years
premature,'' Steenland said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials remained skeptical, however, that the two
carriers could act as distinct, competing airlines under such an
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would they (Continental officials) make the same kinds of
decisions if they were owned by Northwest than if they were
independent of Northwest,'' asked John Nannes, deputy assistant
attorney general in an interview. ``There are lots of different
ways those distinctions could manifest themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As the carriers carry out the stock deal and the alliance, they
will follow the additional restrictions they offered to Justice
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Steenland said the Justice Department was effectively looking
for the 14 percent of the stock Northwest gets to be worth 14
percent of the voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's challenge to the Continental-Northwest
deal may not just affect these two carriers, nor may it be aimed
solely at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may herald the end of consolidation among the major
airlines,'' noted John Gardner, vice president of the Schwab
Washington Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are likely watching this case closely. After the
Northwest-Continental announcement, other carriers reacted with
plans to link-up, though in much less far-reaching ways.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Delta and United made their frequent flier
programs reciprocal, but shelved plans to code-share when the Delta
pilots blocked the agreement after being denied a voting seat on
Delta's board. American and US Airways also have combined their
frequent flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is ``just going to cut everyone off at the kneecaps''
and save the effort of dealing with what the bigger carriers could
later try do, said Barbara Beyer, president of the Va.,-based
AVMARK, an aviation consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Beyer said also believes the Northwest-Continental alliance is
pro-competitive as it allows them to compete with the Big 3
``rather than gnawing at the heel of the elephant.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine days and nights of tortuous
negotiations, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday signed a modest
agreement that restores life to the Middle East peace process and
opens the way for talks on a final resolution of the 50-year-old
fight over whether the Palestinians will have a state.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony at the White House was hosted by a proud,
relieved President Clinton and a visibly ailing King Hussein of
Jordan, suffering from cancer, who spoke movingly of his life's
work for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets a detailed timetable for the Israelis to
withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases
over 12 weeks starting as soon as the agreement is ratified, in
return for specific steps by the Palestinians to fight terrorism
and formally amend their charter to expunge clauses calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the agreement an effort ``to rebuild trust and
renew hope for peace.'' But he urged the leaders to ``carry out
their commitments'' and to have the courage to withstand the
inevitable attacks from ``the enemies of peace'' from both
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Netanyahu, who make no attempt to disguise their
personal dislike, spoke words of peace and determination to
continue down the difficult and wearying road they have begun.
</P>
<P>
   To applause, Arafat acknowledged the difficulties of getting
this accord but vowed: ``We will never leave the peace process and
we will never go back to violence and confrontation.'' Netanyahu
declared: ``Today is a day when Israel and our entire region are
more secure. Now this has required sacrifice from both sides, and
reaching into what Lincoln called the better nature of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   This final tableau of hope and self-congratulation was delayed
and slightly soured, officials said, by an extraordinary,
last-minute demand by Netanyahu _ at 7 a.m. Friday morning, after
the final substance of the Middle East accord had been settled
during a sleepless night _ that the United States release an
American convicted of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the demand to release Jonathan Jay Pollard,
imprisoned since 1985, but promised at the White House ceremony
``to review this matter seriously.'' In return for this public
promise, which may help Netanyahu with his angry right wing at
home, officials said, Netanyahu agreed to sign this agreement and
not renege on his promise to release 750 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement is designed to implement long-delayed Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank called for under the 1993 and 1995
Oslo accords. Netanyahu campaigned for office as an opponent of
those accords, by which Israel and the Palestinians recognize each
other's right to live in peace and commit themselves to
negotiations on a final settlement between them.
</P>
<P>
   These withdrawals were supposed to take place as interim steps,
to build up confidence, but instead they created a mounting crisis
of mistrust and anger, as Netanyahu insisted that the Palestinians
keep specific commitments to fight terrorism and restrain the
number of weapons in areas they control in return for land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous American efforts, it has taken 19 months _ and
then these nine long days and nearly 90 hours of Clinton's own time
_ to seal even this interim deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This interim agreement is ``a big step that came too late,''
Clinton himself admitted. ``It is true that whatever we achieved is
only temporary and that it has been late, but our agreement
underscores that the peace process is going ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the risks and costs of failure, these talks were
an enormous success.
</P>
<P>
   However difficult the sessions at the Wye River Conference
Centers on Maryland's eastern shore, and however modest the
specifics of this deal, an inability to reach agreement here would
have had serious consequences for the Middle East and American
stature in the region, especially among Washington's moderate Arab
allies.
</P>
<P>
   With another crisis brewing with Iraq, and the deadline for the
entire Oslo process running out next May, senior American officials
say, they understood that American strategic interests required
progress here and a quick start on trying to resolve the most
difficult questions of Palestine's borders, whether it will be a
state or not, and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this accord, intensive negotiations are to begin
immediately on a final peace settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians, but given the delay and the onset of the Jewish
Sabbath, when the Israeli government does not work, those talks
could not get started Friday, as American officials had hoped.
Instead, those talks will open after this agreement is ratified,
and Clinton may invite these leaders back for another summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days before the Nov. 3 elections, the accord was also an
important diplomatic triumph for Clinton, who could bask in the
heartfelt praise of the participants for his intensive and
imaginative efforts, though similar praise from his vice president
and secretary of state ``made some of us wince,'' said one career
foreign-service officer involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in particular, was effusive in his praise for
Clinton, calling him a tireless and boundlessly optimistic man with
``a precious and unique gift,'' the ability ``to nudge and prod and
suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore the
possibilities of both sides, and never just on one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, one American official said, helped ameliorate the
``sour mood'' created when Netanyahu ``created a needless crisis
Friday morning in a clumsy attempt to get something he could not
have,'' the release of Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Clinton praised Netanyahu for his strength, will and
grasp of detail. ``He showed himself willing to take political
risks for peace, but not to risk the security of his people,''
Clinton said. ``As a result, this agreement embodies an enormous
increase in the security of the people of Israel.'' Clinton's words
also reflect an American judgment, officials said, that Netanyahu
is politically strong in Israel, despite his willingness to anger
his own right wing, and is likely to win reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu even thanked Arafat for his cooperation and his wishes
for a happy 49th birthday on the very day, Wednesday, that
Netanyahu threatened to leave the talks before backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat spoke of Netanyahu as a ``copartner'' in peace like his
favorite Israeli, the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   And Hussein, who intervened at key moments in the talks, as the
Americans asked him to, with emotional appeals for peace and stern
admonishments for narrow politics, said Israel and the Palestinians
were moving in the right direction. Bald from his chemotherapy and
clearly weak, the king appealed to the better instincts of everyone
in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste,'' the king said. ``And it's time that together we occupy a
place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them and of
their sons, the descendants of the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders then signed the accords on a walnut conference table
bought by President Grant in 1869 and last used in 1994 for the
peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed by Rabin and
Hussein.

CIA TO ACQUIRE ROLE IN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN SECURITY

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Middle East peace agreement gives the CIA a new
and potentially risky role in safeguarding security for Israel and
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The pact empowers intelligence operatives to referee disputes
involving the handling of suspected terrorists, to monitor who is
arrested and jailed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to
help establish sophisticated and reliable border checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   While the CIA has quietly been performing many of these tasks
for the last three years, Friday's accord brings those covert
activities in from the cold and thrusts the CIA into the center of
the Middle East peace effort, making the CIA responsible for
monitoring and verifying the toughest provisions of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's ability to win the confidence of both sides by
monitoring West Bank security issues in recent years was credited
with helping to open the door to the broader agreement, a point
that President Clinton acknowledged Friday when he noted that
George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, ``had an
unusual, almost unprecedented role to play because of the security
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   While broadening the agency's mission and influence in the
Middle East, the public role of the CIA in the region carries
significant new opportunities and risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely appropriate to use our intelligence assets to
promote stability and peace in the world,'' said David Boren, a
former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ``We're going
to see a lot more use of the CIA to get the cooperation of other
nations in multilateral actions to preserve peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But some intelligence officials fear the heightened visibility
of CIA operatives could compromise their sources and methods, and
perhaps even their safety. The agency could also get bogged down in
political crossfire that it has been able to dodge by working in
the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, who was Clinton's first director of Central
Intelligence, said Friday, ``I feel far more positively about the
substance of what the agency is doing than the fact it's becoming
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Some policy-makers might be more tempted to meddle with the
agency's primary responsibility to collect intelligence and provide
unbiased assessments, Woolsey said. And there is a danger, some
officials say, of the CIA's associating too closely with the
Palestinian intelligence service, whose agents are not in the habit
of extracting information without extracting fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enmeshing the CIA in this is a serious, serious mistake,''
said Dov Zakheim, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan
administration. ``The CIA is essentially getting involved as an
umpire. If anything goes wrong in the Middle East, guess who gets
blamed? The umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said this week that Tenet has been trying
to deepen the CIA's role in building trust between the Shin Bet,
the Israeli internal security service and the Palestinian security
service.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the CIA's station chief in Israel has
been acting as a go-between and sharing U.S. intelligence with the
Israelis and the Palestinians. The station chief's last assignment
was as the CIA's liaison to Congress, a good training ground for
impossible confrontational situations.
</P>
<P>
   Boren, whose staff director for the intelligence committee was
Tenet, said the benefits of the CIA's new role outweighed the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradeoff in giving up some protection of our
intelligence source, methods and technical means, but I think it's
worth it to obtain the greater good,'' said Boren. ``Those who are
opposed are locked into a Cold War mode of thinking.''

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS REACH INTERIM ACCORD THAT TRADES LAND FOR
SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a critical breakthrough for peace in the Middle
East, Israelis and Palestinians reached an interim accord Friday
that trades land for security and may bring both parties closer to
a lasting treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, reached at dawn after a marathon negotiating session,
gives the Palestinians control over about 40 percent of the West
Bank and offers them new economic opportunities in exchange for
pledges to co-operate with tough measures to fight terrorism in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, sitting at a historic walnut
table in the East Room of the White House where peace treaties have
been signed for 100 years, placed their names on the agreement with
Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein signing as observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around the world should be heartened by this
achievement today,'' Clinton said. ``The Israeli and Palestinian
peoples, whose better rivalry in this century has brought so much
suffering to both sides, have moved yet another step closer toward
fulfilling the promise of the Oslo accords.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will implement the interim steps outlined in the
1993 accords and will require the Israelis and Palestinians to
begin the so-called final status talks that will determine even
more delicate issues such as the creation of a Palestinian state
and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's a day when Israel and our entire region are more
secure. Now this has required sacrifice from both sides and
reaching into what (President) Lincoln called the better nature of
mankind. This is an important moment to give a secure and peaceful
future for our children and the children of our neighbors, the
Palestinians. We have seized this moment,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Arafat, ``We will never leave the peace process, and we
will never go back to violence and confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., Israeli and Palestinian delegations had been secluded
at the Wye River Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore for
nine days in an effort to resolve talks that had been stalled for
19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived at the conference center around 9 a.m.
Thursday for the final push, kept the delegations haggling
throughout the night to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Memorandum calls for Israel to withdraw its troops
from 13 percent of the occupied West Bank in return for a detailed
security plan that includes arrests of suspected terrorists and
seizure of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also agreed to provide two routes of safe passage between
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for Palestinians who must cross
Israeli territory as well as a Palestinian airport in Gaza and a
seaport access.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians agreed to alter provisions in their charter
that call for the destruction of Israel and Clinton pledged to
personally address the Palestinian National Council to urge the
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement nearly unraveled before it could be announced when
Netanyahu pressed President Clinton to release an American jailed
for spying for Israel. The dispute over the fate of Jonathan
Pollard caused heated exchanges between the two leaders but they
eventually reached a compromise that set the issue aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis won a concession reducing the number of Palestinian
prisoners to be released from jails in Israel from 750 to 400 and
Clinton agreed to review the Pollard case, but would not offer any
guarantees to his release.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu brought up the Pollard matter after he and Arafat
already had agreed to the main provisions in the accord. The
Israelis wanted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence and is
considered a hero by some Israelis, released so he could return on
Netanyahu's airplane this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The interim peace pact also marked a deepening role by the
United States in the Middle East as the Central Intelligence
Agency, a key participant in the Wye River talks, will play a role
to insure the security guarantees are carried out. Clinton pledged
to seek funding from Congress to help Israel offset security costs
and to help the Palestinians with economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. president, who spent nearly 80 hours at the Wye River
sessions, invested enormous amounts of his prestige in the
negotiations. Netanyahu, who often publicly jousts with the
president, called him a ``warrior for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   All sides also pointed to King Hussein, ailing with cancer and
frail from chemotherapy, for playing a key role in the talks.
Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 war. It did not
officially make peace with Israel until 1994, but Hussein has
played a moderating influence in the region for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste,
and it's time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our
peoples, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendents of
the children of Abraham _ Palestinians and Israelis coming
together,'' Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, however, was immediately condemned by hard-liners
in both the Israeli and Palestinian camps. Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
leader of the extremist group Hamas, called the pact a sellout and
warned that the CIA ``cannot erase Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli hard-liners threatened to bring down Netanyahu's
conservative government and Jewish settlers in the occupied
territories warned of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, as peace gains momentum, forces of hate, no matter
how isolated and desperate, will once again lash out,'' Clinton
warned. ``They know this, the leaders, and they are prepared to
face it. Staying on the path of peace under these circumstances
will demand even greater leadership and courage.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Man seen with victim wanted for questioning in hotel slaying
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Police want to question a man caught on a
hotel surveillance tape with one of the victims of last Sunday's
triple homicide at the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is shown getting on the elevator with Phillip Dover
at 2:10 a.m., is a possible witness in the case, Atlanta police
said Friday. The stranger is dressed in a khaki jumper or possibly
uniform, with a black or dark cap. He is walking slightly behind
Dover as the two appear to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they could not release the tape earlier because it
has taken detectives all week to sift through several frames of
tape that were clear enough to release to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dover, 31, of Gainesville, Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte
Springs, Fla., and Ronald Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla., were
found by a maid on Sunday morning, shot execution-style in room
2414 of the Hilton. They had come to Atlanta to see the Atlanta
Falcons-New Orleans Saints football game.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have speculated that the three victims may also
have been involved with prostitutes, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly
Harvard on Friday refused to allow her officers to discuss
prostitution trends in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, who was at a convention in Salt Lake City when news of
the slayings broke Sunday, has not commented on the investigation
and refused to comment on the incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Atlanta homicide investigators are comparing
notes with College Park police to determine whether a
robbery-homicide that occurred at a Days Inn three days before the
Hilton killings are related. Investigators have said shell casings
found at both scenes come from the same caliber handgun. They would
not release any information on the gun or guns, such as the
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   College Park Detective David O'Neal said earlier this week that
the cases have similarities. Ladaris Hawkins, 19, was shot in the
face at the Days Inn after, police believe, someone stepped into
his room and awakened him. As in the Atlanta case, no one forced
their way into Hawkins' room before shooting him around 10:30 p.m.
on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, like the three Atlanta victims, was found in his
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police Maj. Mickey Lloyd would not comment on either the
Atlanta or the College Park case on Friday, except to say that
police are interested in finding the man seen on the surveillance
tape. ``We are seeking the man that was seen with Dover,'' Lloyd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels around Atlanta have raised about $30,000 as a reward in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide investigators are asking anyone with information to
call 404-817-6700 or 404-853-4235.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 7 a.m., after a long night of bargaining ended
with handshakes and, it seemed, a peace agreement, the Israeli
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, met alone with President
Clinton and made one last demand: As part of the deal, the United
States had to free Jonathan Pollard, the American serving life in
prison for spying for Israel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several hours at the Wye River Conference Center,
American officials scrambled to hold together an agreement that had
taken nine days to negotiate. Netanyahu said he would refuse to
sign the accord without Pollard's release, officials said, even as
Israeli television and radio stations reported his freedom had
already been won, infuriating the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought it was over,'' a senior administration
official said, describing the frantic negotiations that followed
the early-morning handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides sharply disputed the reasons for the snag, with
the Americans accusing Netanyahu of throwing up last-minute
demands, while the Israelis said he was simply trying to nail down
something they believed Clinton had promised earlier in the talks:
a pardon for Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged that the fate of Pollard, a Navy intelligence analyst,
had been discussed at Wye but not, they insisted, as part of the
agreement announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But even the discussion of Pollard's release caught officials at
the Pentagon and within the nation's intelligence community by
surprise, reviving the deep anger still felt in those quarters
about Pollard's espionage and raising concern that a process has
now been set in motion that, for political reasons, will result in
freedom for an admitted spy.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Pollard, whose cause has been championed by many
Jews in Israel and the United States, could well help Netanyahu
with his own right wing as he sells a new peace agreement
negotiated with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And one administration official, speaking on the condition that
he not be identified, suggested that Pollard could be released at a
later date to promote the peace process. But the official suggested
that any possible release of Pollard would be announced in a way
that appeared separate from Friday's agreement, comparable to how
the United States quietly withdrew its nuclear missiles from Turkey
shortly after the Soviet Union withdrew its nuclear missiles from
Cuba during the missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the president refused Netanyahu's demand to release
Pollard. But before Netanyahu agreed Friday afternoon to proceed
with the accord, he wrung a public statement from Clinton that he
would reconsider Pollard's longstanding pleas for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to Pollard, I have agreed to review this matter
seriously, at the prime minister's request,'' Clinton said at the
ceremony in the East Room of the White House, where the agreement
was signed. ``I have made no commitment as to the outcome of the
review.''

DOWN MARKET WEIGHS ON DONATIONS, TOO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Minn., N.Y., Tenn., Pa.)   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since June, gifts of cash to the United Jewish Appeal-Federation
of Jewish Philanthropies of New York are running several million
dollars below last year.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Community Trust received 13 gifts of stock in the
last two weeks of August 1997. But when the stock market was
falling in the equivalent period this year, not one gift of stock
came in.
</P>
<P>
   And at the San Francisco Opera, two board members have asked to
defer or delay their pledges, as have several donors to the Boston
Lyric Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, many charities say that with the stock
market's summer swoon, the wild swings in share prices that have
followed and the recent drop in interest rates, they have observed
a sudden drop in donations _ and, in what may be a more ominous
sign, a decline in inquiries from donors about future gifts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many charities say they have seen no signs that
donations are slowing. Leaders of charities in Silicon Valley and
Minneapolis said that giving was growing. But in New York and a
half-dozen other cities, charity officials say market volatility
has created apprehension about the future value of assets.
</P>
<P>
   If those worries translate into a slowdown in giving after two
years of robust growth, it would take some of the polish off what
has been widely hailed as a golden age of philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Biggs, chief executive of the TIAA-CREF pension system
and volunteer chairman of the United Way of New York City, said the
drop in the value of his portfolio had affected his own thoughts
about giving to a host of charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes you think, `Maybe a little less,''' he said last week at
the kickoff for the current United Way campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is widespread. ``The volatility in the market is
causing a general mood of conservatism among all donors,'' said
Karen Brooks Hopkins, development director for the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rose, whose family members are prominent supporters of
performing arts and low-income housing charities in New York, said
the concern about gifts was highest among those with modest new
wealth from stocks and mutual funds. ``People who were giving
surpluses now are concerned about having any surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Americans gave $109.3 billion in 1997, the American
Association of Fund-Raising Council Trust for Philanthropy
estimated. Giving rose almost 7 percent in both 1997 and 1996, more
than three times the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But as charities approach the closing weeks of the year, when
many collect half of their annual donations, there is concern that
instead of a torrent of gifts there may be only scattered showers.
</P>
<P>
   Many charities say that for the year, their donations are
running ahead of 1997, but that the growth was all in the first six
months of 1998, before the Dow Jones industrial average peaked at
9,337.97 on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the United
Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York,
which raised a quarter-billion dollars last year, said that gifts
of appreciated property remained strong even as cash gifts dropped,
but that the start of layoffs on Wall Street was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never helps when the financial industry is going through
this kind of turmoil, and we are alert to potential implications,''
he said. ``The last six weeks of the year will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Community Trust also said overall giving was up
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins, the Brooklyn Academy of Music development director,
said: ``Right now we are in the contemplative-hysterical stage.
People are saying, `I lost 40 percent of my portfolio, I have to
think this through,' when asked about another gift. No one has said
out and out, `We are not giving.' And if the market drop just turns
into a correction, all it will mean is that we will have to work a
little harder. But there is a lot of concern about the value of the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of job layoffs caused by turmoil in the financial
markets and depressed oil prices is also raising concerns about how
well annual fund-raising campaigns will fare in New York, Houston,
New Orleans and some other cities.
</P>
<P>
   A recession could actually benefit many charities, said Robert
F. Sharpe, a planned-giving consultant in Memphis who has written
extensively about giving patterns in this century. Giving, he has
found, typically rises during hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the wealth effect takes about two years before
it breaks the charitable giving cycle, so it will be 2001 before we
really know what is going on,'' Sharpe said. ``People cancel
vacations before they cancel their pledges to their church or
synagogue or college.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent wild swings in stock prices have prompted some donors to
time their gifts, either in the hope of new market highs or to get
the maximum tax benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clients who are waiting to fund charitable trusts as
far into the year as they can,'' said W. Christopher Singleton,
director of trust and nonprofit services for the Merrill Lynch
Trust Co. ``They want the opportunity of a rebound in individual
securities they plan to transfer into the trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Heisman, president of the National Philanthropic Trust in
Jenkintown, Pa., said she was running on a boardwalk in Cape May,
N.J., the morning after the Dow plummeted 512 points on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about a major donor who was waiting for the
stock market to reach a certain threshold before making a gift, and
when I saw the headlines on the newspaper racks, I shouted `Oh,
no!' so loudly a guy running by stopped to see what was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the prospective donor ``has never called back.''

TENSIONS HEIGHTENED IN CHILE OVER PINOCHET'S ARREST
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chilean leftist politicians who have applauded
the arrest in London of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator,
say they are receiving anonymous death threats. A rightist
political party that supports the general canceled a news
conference because of a bomb threat. And an unidentified protester
threw a gasoline bomb at a police car.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents over the last 48 hours have heightened tensions
here, spurring more aggressive demonstrations and inflaming debates
on talk radio about Pinochet's 17-year rule and the efforts of a
Spanish judge to have him extradited to Spain to stand trial for
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In a television address on Thursday night, President Eduardo
Frei warned that there were people trying ``to introduce the germ
of violence.'' He added, ``I condemn them with all my energy and
when we need to, we will apply the full force of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week that has followed Pinochet's arrest in a London
clinic, where he has been recovering from back surgery, the daily
demonstrations here supporting and opposing him have been marked by
scattered rock and egg throwing, a few fights, and police use of
water cannon to disperse crowds. About 100 people have been
arrested, although only a few people have been held more than a few
hours, and no one has been seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesting has been peaceful. Municipal officials
have refused to pick up garbage at the British and Spanish
embassies, but diplomats have been saved any inconvenience by
Chilean critics of Pinochet who have volunteered to cart away the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his arrest has highlighted divisions that have
endured since he gave up the presidency in 1990. When police
officers broke up a small, peaceful anti-Pinochet demonstration in
front of the Moneda Presidential Palace on Thursday, they appeared
to needlessly rough up several youths and journalists even while
they dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   And several conservative politicians have begun to assert that
Socialist members of the governing coalition are behind the Spanish
extradition efforts, an accusation that Socialist Party officials
and their Christian Democratic partners deny.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of political leaders and analysts are
expressing fears that a prolonged international legal struggle over
Pinochet will expose the country to renewed splintering and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most delicate moment we have experienced in the
democratic transition,'' said Andres Zaldivar, president of the
Senate and a Christian Democratic candidate for president. ``I'm
not afraid of a coup or an interruption of democracy, but I see the
possibility of the country entering into a period of serious
tensions, polarization and constant demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is stepping up diplomatic efforts seeking
Pinochet's release, saying that foreigners are interfering in
Chile's domestic affairs and jeopardizing the emerging democracy
here.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean officials say that as a ``Senator for Life,'' Pinochet
carried a diplomatic passport and should have been immune from
arrest. But British authorities have rejected the claim, saying he
was in London for health reasons, not diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean diplomats are now pressing another argument. They say
that at age 82, Pinochet is in poor health and may not be able to
survive the pressures of an extradition and trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean press is reporting that Pinochet, who is a diabetic
and has a history of circulatory problems, is recovering very
slowly from an operation two weeks ago on a herniated disk due to
multiple infections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pinochet's arrest may influence next year's presidential
election. The two right-wing parties, one of which had been
distancing itself from the Pinochet legacy to broaden its appeal,
have found new unity in support of the retired dictator. And
tensions are emerging in the left-of-center governing coalition,
with most Christian Democrats supporting the president's strong
defense of Pinochet and most Socialists quietly applauding the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Israel, chairman of the political science department at
the University of Chile, said the long-term impact of the Pinochet
arrest is bound to be profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is resolved rapidly, it could be a blessing as we
finally learn that we need to face up to human rights abuses of the
past,'' Israel said. ``But if Pinochet dies in custody, many
Chileans will look for someone to blame and you could see
uncontrolled waves of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The British interior minister, Jack Straw, is expected to decide
within days how his government will rule on a Spanish extradition
request. In a note to the House of Commons on Thursday, Straw
suggested that as one of several options open to him, he could deny
extradition on humanitarian grounds.

WORTHWHILE SPECIAL ABOUT BLACKS AND THE PITTSBURGH POLICE FORCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKS AND BLUE
</P>
<P>
   Hosted and reported by: Geraldo Rivera
</P>
<P>
   Produced by: Keith Brown
</P>
<P>
   Date: 10-25/ Sunday, 7-8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks and Blue,'' a worthwhile special about race and the
Pittsburgh police force, has two objectives. One is to explore the
relations between minority communities and city cops. The other,
hidden one, is a further attempt by host-reporter Geraldo Rivera to
re-angle himself from tabloid-TV trash mouth to a more upright
position in the electronic news business. ``Blacks and Blue'' is
the first of several reports by Rivera that the network has agreed,
some say reluctantly, to broadcast on NBC proper. Rivera is a
valued ratings-grabber mostly confined to CNBC, the company's cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute program, airing Sunday at 7 p.m. on Channel 7,
does both jobs well enough, if not with distinction. Rivera has
always seemed like a Mike Wallace knockoff, his aggressiveness
baldly contrived with the help of a second-tier drama coach. But
here, anyway, it's in the service of a serious subject to which
Rivera brings light as well as his familiar blazing-eyed and
moustachioed heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks and Blue'' traces recent events in Pittsburgh that led
to widespread citizen complaints about allegedly racist police
behavior, an ACLU lawsuit, and unprecedented federal monitoring of
a police department judged to have ``a history of misconduct.''
Never mind just how much of the generally solid reporting Rivera is
responsible for _ there's no way to know. But he elucidates the
prickly issues through strong narration and straightforward,
emotive interviews that reveal explosive mutual mistrust,
especially between black citizens and what appears to be an
overwhelmingly white police force.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the program never indicates the exact size of the
department or the number of minority officers it employs, which
would be especially relevant, as would more information about the
city's demographics and something about its history of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, ``Blacks and Blue'' is strongest on
anecdote and emotion. It features harrowing, discouraging, and very
credible first-person accounts of brutality against black citizens,
and the sharp rebuttals of resentful beat cops Rivera seems
comfortable interrogating, sometimes in their patrol cars en route
to tense crime scenes. It also features enlightening interviews
with federal and city officials, and Pittsburgh's NAACP president.
</P>
<P>
   The report is fair but consistent with Rivera's opinionated,
advocacy style of journalism, which he tempers somewhat for this
network presentation. He doesn't conceal that he's troubled by
America's history of injustice, and seems unconvinced that police
hostile to the controls eventually imposed on them have a
legitimate beef.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll taken for the special indicates, unsurprisingly,
how differently law enforcement is perceived by blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera dons a variety of outfits in the program _ jeans and
jacket here, fashionable suit there, shirt sans jacket or tie
elsewhere _ almost as if drawing attention to his search for a new
news guy identity.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in the self-congratulatory sparkle of the East
Room of the White House, the words of caution rang loud and clear.
If it took 19 months of blood and insult and nine days of
extraordinary round-the-clock wrangling just to do things that were
supposed to have been done months ago, what superhuman intervention
would be required to surmount the truly formidable issues of
refugees, Jerusalem, water?
</P>
<P>
   Yet among the exhausted Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
participants, there was a distinct sense that, however technical or
tentative the actual arrangements they had made, however certain
the knowledge that they would be disputed and violated, both
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat had crossed a painful and fateful political
threshhold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This peace agreement represents not just the drawing of a new
territorial map, but the reconfiguring of the political map for
both sides,'' said David Makovsky, the veteran political reporter
for Haaretz. ``It is almost certain to mark a confrontation between
each leader and the hard-line elements in his camp.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important shift was in the Israeli camp.
Netanyahu arrived in Wye a man whose true colors had never been
revealed. For all the endless recriminations, crises and debates
that accompanied his first 29 months in office, no one in Israel
was really sure whether he was at heart an ideologue intent on
destroying the Oslo agreements, or a conservative pragmatist who
would ultimately recognize that there was no alternative to trading
land for peace, and would do so after ratcheting up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   When he left, the prime minister was firmly in the moderate
camp. Even if the ``Wye Memorandum'' suffers in coming weeks, he
had finally declared himself. And he was certain of a brutal war
with right-wing extremists, for whom he was now a traitor as bitter
as Yitzhak Rabin, the late prime minister who signed the Oslo
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Even through the enforced stillness of the Sabbath in Israel
there came the hum of speculation about new elections, new
political alignments, new dangers from the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Though less dramatic, Arafat's shift was no less momentous. In
the four years since he had returned triumphant to Gaza, the
promise of the Oslo agreements had turned to sour disappointment
among Palestinians under the weight of corruption, poverty,
violence, and stagnation in the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   A chilling poll taken just before the Wye conference showed that
for the first time since Oslo was signed in 1993, a majority of
Palestinians again supported terror as a weapon. But already long
before that, the adulation for Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Islamic founder
of the virulently anti-Oslo movement Hamas, demonstrated that the
Palestinian Authority was on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat repeatedly tried to waffle _ arresting a few leaders of
Hamas now and then, then reaching out a hand of friendship. He
spoke of peace in English, and of ``holy war'' in Arabic. He
condemned suicide killings but spoke of fallen terrorists as
martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   So when he finally agreed at Wye to a concrete war on terror,
one to be monitored by the U.S. CIA, he effectively declared war on
Hamas. Until now, the Islamic movement had tried not to publicly
challenge Arafat and to mount terror operations from Israeli-held
territory so the Palestinian Authority would not be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is every chance that Arafat will have to protect
himself and his lieutenants from Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   The result, curiously, was a triumph for the very Oslo process
that both men had accused the other of undermining. The underlying
theory of the agreement, which devised a staged process of
reconciliation leading slowly to a final settlement, was to allow
Jews and Arabs time to change their mutual perceptions, to cease
seeing the other as an existential threat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the architects of the treaty were optimistic in their
estimate of the time it would take, and the past 19 months will be
viewed as the time it took for Israelis to step back and take a
deeper breath and for Palestinians to adjust their expectations.
History may also judge that the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by
an extreme nationalist exposed so yawning an ideological divide
among the Jews that a whole new approach was required, with a
conservative at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Wye conference represented a gamble by
President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that
both sides were ripe for a change. The fact that a difficult
election loomed close obviously contributed to the calculation,
though it also raised the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   After trying virtually every other negotiating approach, Clinton
went for the pressure cooker, summoning the principals and all
their top aides to an isolated farm, and devoting scores of his own
hours and sleepless nights to cajoling, mediating, nudging and
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Given the huge political risk to each leader, , both Netanyahu
and Arafat struggled mightily for the concessions that would
demonstrate to their people that their political shift carried
tangible benefits. The Israelis demanded concrete, guaranteed steps
against specific terrorists; they insisted on a public renunciation
of the vows to eradicate Israel in the old Palestinian Charter.
Arafat battled for a Palestinian airport, seaport, for safe passage
between Gaza and the West Bank, for the release of Palestinian
prisoners, for assurances that Israel would cede more land.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the last concession on which success hinged was
asked not of Netanyahu, not of Arafat, but of Clinton. With the
package almost tied up, Netanyahu required one more achievement he
could bring home to his right wing, and late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon came up with the key _ the United States
would release Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy whose release has
long been demanded by Israel and who had taken Israeli citizenship
in prison. Arafat liked it, too: if Pollard were released, Arafat
would not be compelled to jail or extradite a Palestinian wanted by
Israel who now serves in the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently the U.S. intelligence agencies balked, adding
another several hours to the ninth day and leading Clinton to
insist at the ceremony that he had agreed only to review Pollard's
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The need by both Netanyahu and Arafat to assuage their critics
was clear in their comments. ``Today is a day when Israel and the
entire region are more secure,'' declared Netanyahu, while Arafat
went through the entire list of what he had gained, from the
airport to the prisoners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But to many who watched the ceremony, the more telling message
was not in the words, but in some of the images. Most striking was
the picture of the two Arab veterans, King Hussein of Jordan and
Arafat, both small, feeble and obviously ailing after lives spent
in struggle. Hussein, undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, was thin
and hairless, while Arafat's lower lip trembled uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the tall and hale president and Israeli, they hardly
looked like the existential threat to Israel they were supposed to
be. Netanyahu, for his part, seemed to struggle to keep his eyes
open after a sleepless night. After 29 months of bluster,
maneuvering and political struggle, he seemed tired and subdued.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was not any concrete concession or agreement, but
the cancer-ravaged king who was singled out by all sides as the
force that broke the deadlock. Though his words on Thursday night
were not made known, they seemed to render both Clinton and
Netanyahu misty-eyed when they recalled it. A man who obviously had
no agenda of his own left, and who had known this fray from the
beginning, the king added just the right dash of human and
historical perspective to an exercise that until then was purely
political and technical.

   EPERNAY, France _ Champagne is to New Year's as cotton candy is
to carnivals. So, with the millennium approaching, and with it the
biggest New Year's Eve party in a while, sparkling wine makers
throughout Europe are happy to talk about how well they are doing
these days.
</P>
<P>
   In this quaint city at the heart of the Champagne district in
northeastern France, as elsewhere in the country and in Spain and
other countries, sparkling wine makers are busily taking orders for
the celebration. Some wineries will release special millennium
champagnes, others have increased the amounts they produce, and
there will be emphasis on distinctive packaging, with bigger
bottles and memorable labels.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of champagne _ who are expected to deliver 280
million bottles worldwide this year _ expect to top 300 million for
the first time in 1999; The makers of cava, the sparkling wine from
northeastern Spain, expect to sell 215 million bottles in 1998, 20
percent more than last year, and are forecasting similar growth in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of bubbles is booming,'' said Daniel Lorson, a
spokesman for the organization here that represents the champagne
producers.
</P>
<P>
   But among those bubbles is at least one cloudy enough to cause
analysts and wine makers to worry.
</P>
<P>
   As the economic malaise in Asia threatens to put a damper on
sales in a region that no longer has much to celebrate and to
infect the rising middle class in other emerging markets that have
proven lucrative to European sparkling wine makers, the industry is
banking increasingly on the turning of the millennium to maintain
the momentum of its recovery from a severe battering in the early
1990s. Indeed, wine makers are so optimistic that some experts are
increasingly apprehensive about a possible post-2000 hangover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two years will be very positive for champagne,'' said
Jean-Marie L'Home, an analyst with Banque Nationale de Paris.
``After that, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, the industry's overall export business is
coming up roses. This year, producers of cava will export 105
million bottles, double the amount five years ago; in France,
exports of champagne will rise to 110 million bottles, up from 73
million in 1992. ``They have very, very good income,'' said Michel
Bettane, editor of Revue du Vin de France, a French trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, champagne sales qualify as one of the few bright spots
for luxury goods conglomerates like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton, the French group that makes not only Louis Vuitton bags
and Hennessy brandy but also owns several of the most prestigious
champagne brands, including Moet &AMP; Chandon.
</P>
<P>
   Flagging sales in Asia, where LVMH generates roughly half its
revenue, have pushed its share price down to about 950 French
francs, or $158, from 1,600 last year. But of all LVMH's
businesses, champagne ``is getting more profitable, and is the only
one improving,'' said Joseline Gaudino, who follows the group at
Societe Generale in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Production of French champagne, in the region that invented
sparkling wine in the 17th century, represents just 4 percent of
total French wine production. But in 1997, champagne generated
roughly 33 percent of France's $4 billion in earnings from wine
exports.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady years of the 1980s, sales of sparkling wines like
champagne and Spanish cava, borne aloft by the decade's conspicuous
consumption, grew rapidly. By 1989 champagne makers delivered 249
million bottles to consumers, compared with 35 million bottles in
the 1950s. In Spain, cava's triumph was equally spectacular. In
1989, sales reached 142 million bottles, up from 81 million a
decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But as corks popped around the globe, prices for sparkling wine
soared, as did the cost of the grapes used to make it. In 1992, as
recession engulfed Europe, the bubble burst. That year, champagne
sales plummeted to 214 million bottles; by the following year,
sales of cava had slumped to 128 million bottles.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, one of the biggest markets, consumption of
sparkling wines peaked in 1985 at 18 million 9-liter cases (216
million bottles) but then hit the skids and declined to about 12
million cases (144 million bottles) last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until two years ago, one of every two companies in the
Champagne region was losing money,'' said Jean-Marie Laborde, chief
executive of Moet &AMP; Chandon, which has made champagne since 1724.
</P>
<P>
   When the market collapsed, prices did too. In France, champagne
prices dropped by as much as 65 percent, and those who rarely drank
champagne before could not resist picking at the bargains.
</P>
<P>
   That, paradoxically, started a market recovery. Faced with the
dilution of champagne's image by excessive sales, big houses like
Moet &AMP; Chandon introduced new and fancier products to revive
champagne's cachet, and poured millions of dollars into promoting
their qualities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bollinger, for example, a family owned producer, focused on
educating the consumer. ``The way people drank champagne in the
'80s, like a bottle of beer in the wine bars, was wrong,'' said Guy
Bizot, director of marketing at Bollinger, which countered the
trend by publishing a ``charter of ethics and quality,'' and
spruced up its labels to improve their products' image and explain
them to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Wine makers poured on the marketing, though, to counter the
biggest obstacle to a comeback _ fresh competitors from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, giants like Southcorp, one of the world's largest
producers of premium wines, began delivering to Europe and Japan.
In the United States, E.&AMP; J. Gallo Winery, with sparkling wines
that were drinkable yet cost as little as $3.99 a bottle, did
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to the wall, European sparkling wine makers realized
they had to respond or be marginalized in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where 80 percent of the world's sparkling wines are
consumed, they spent lavishly to plant the idea that sparkling wine
is essential to a comfortable style of life. Companies with grand
old names like Veuve Clicquot and Piper-Heidsieck emphasized the
inherent difficulty of producing champagne and the cachet that its
relative scarcity affords.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sex appeal to champagne, almost a physical
attraction,'' said Michel Bourqui, of the Office International de
la Vigne et du Vin, a Paris trade organization that helped devise
the strategies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spanish cava makers used aggressive marketing,
with film stars like Sharon Stone and Paul Newman, and more
affordable prices to expand their market share.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have clearly paid off as the wine companies _ each
with markedly differing strategies _ appeal to different groups of
customers. And all of them, keeping in mind that possible sales
hangover, are getting ready to pull out the stops for the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Moet &AMP; Chandon, which dominates the French business, will put a
special double-sized magnum on sale in January for $60 to $70 a
bottle with a silk ribbon, the date 2000 and a red wax seal. As a
promotion, it is donating Jeroboams (double magnums, and thus the
equivalent of four bottles) of its premier Dom Perignon champagne
to charities in the United States for fund raising. The first of
the big bottles, which were auctioned last year, fetched $2,500 to
$4,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   But the real growth at Moet has come from a proliferation of
champagne varieties, many sold under its lower-priced Mercier
label, the No. 1 brand in France. ``We decided to open to the
consumer more choices,'' Laborde, the Moet &AMP; Chandon executive,
said. ``We used to be like Ford: any color, as long as it's
black.'' Yet Moet's growth next year will be ``lower than the
champagne industry,'' he said, so that ``if there is a hangover
afterward, it will be less so for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollinger, which dates from 1829, is also preparing a millenium
bottle, but Bizot called it ``nothing out of the ordinary, for
Bollinger.'' With thinly veiled swipes at big corporate competitors
like LVMH and Seagram, which owns Mumm and Perrier Jouet, Bizot
said scarcity was a valuable marketing device to maintain
champagne's exclusive image. ``You cannot take advantage of a
situation to jeopardize our future,'' he said. ``I think a lot of
companies are doing that.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among Spanish cava makers, estimates of next year's sales vary.
</P>
<P>
   At the Freixenet wineries in the village of San Sadurniu, south
of Barcelona, the director of domestic sales, Jose Maria Ferrer,
who until last year directed operations in the United States,
ventured that ``sales in 1999 will be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Freixenet's rival, Codurniu, the forecast is more
cautious. ``The trade is definitely going to load in next year,''
said Clay Philipp Daum, export director at Codurniu, a market
leader. ``How much consumers will consume, no one will know till
January of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although robust sales are certainly expected, no one
knows exactly how much more champagne will be consumed in the
holiday season next year than in ordinary years. Moreover, since
champagne must be aged, the sparkling wines that will be used to
toast in the new millennium have already been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me as a wine maker, the year 2000 is already in the
cellar,'' said Richard Geoffroy, chief taster at Dom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   Could supplies run out, and bottles of champagne be available
only at outrageous prices, or through shady black market channels?
Or might the whole thing fizzle?
</P>
<P>
   Perish the thought. If the industry succeeds in making steady
customers of merely 5 percent to 10 percent of those consumers who
on New Year's Eve 1999 will taste sparkling wine for the first
time, Ferrer says, it can celebrate itself and weather any headache
the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Laborde of Moet &AMP; Chandon said he believed the best
antidote to a slump may yet prove to be Asia. ``The next three
years will not be what we expected two years ago,'' he
acknowledged. But a recovery in Southeast Asia, led by a revival of
the Japanese economy, might just coincide with the early years of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in those markets,'' he said. ``They have 30 million
to 50 million people with occidental buying power.''

U.S. SUES TO BAR NORTHWEST AIR FROM KEY STAKE IN CONTINENTAL

<P>
   The Justice Department filed suit Friday to prevent Northwest
Airlines from buying a controlling stake in Continental Airlines,
saying the deal would stymie airline competition and lead to higher
ticket prices for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the first time that the government has tried to
block a deal between two major airlines since the industry was
deregulated 20 years ago. It appears to signal that the Clinton
administration, which has stepped up antitrust enforcement, will
not permit further consolidation of the airline industry, which has
coalesced around a handful of large carriers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable, quality air transportation is critical to
consumers both in their personal lives and in their businesses,''
said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``This acquisition would
lead to higher ticket prices and worse service for the over 4
million passengers traveling on the routes dominated by the two
airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the government's case is that control of
Continental by Northwest would diminish competition between the two
airlines, especially on seven routes between their largest hub
airports. Northwest, the country's fourth-largest carrier,
dominates air traffic in Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis.
Continental, the nation's No 5 carrier, is now the single largest
airline in the New York area operating from its hub in Newark, N.J.
It also dominates the airports in Houston and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not immediately clear how effective Friday's action
would be. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit,
seeks to block the Northwest-Continental transaction, but the
government did not ask the court to stop the two airlines from
completing the deal while the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also did not address an alliance agreement between
the two airlines that would enable them to sell seats on each
others flights and engage in other joint marketing while
maintaining separate managements, employees and fleets. Continental
has described the arrangement as a ``virtual merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling both the equity investment and the alliance
pro-competitive and pro-consumer, Northwest said Friday that it
will acquire the stake in Continental, ``within weeks, if not
days,'' while it prepares to challenge the government in court. If
it loses, it will be forced to divest itself of the Continental
shares, but that might not be for awhile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This litigation could drag on for years to come,'' said
Continental general counsel Jeffery Smisek.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts were puzzled that the government did not seek
a temporary order to stop the carriers. But government lawyers said
it would be possible for the Justice Department to get a decision
from the court relatively quickly, perhaps within a year, and that
it could still block the alliance, which it is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why it has to be a multiyear proceeding
like the old IBM case,'' John Nannes, the deputy assistant attorney
general in the antitrust division, said in an interview Friday.
``Merger cases can be brought to trial very promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the government did not seek a temporary restraining
order because Northwest and Continental were not proposing to make
changes that could not easily be undone.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case promises to have far-reaching
implications for the airline industry. After Northwest and
Continental announced their alliance in January, the country's
other major airlines scrambled to match them, fearing that the
larger network of a combined Northwest and Continental would lure
away their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, United Airlines, the country's largest, agreed to
link its domestic network with Delta Air Lines, the third-largest
carrier. American Airlines, the second-largest, struck a deal with
US Airways, the sixth- largest.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the agreements involved exchanges of stock, they
alarmed lawmakers in Washington who have grown increasingly
concerned about rising ticket prices and declining airline
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, United and Delta were forced to scrap plans to
jointly market their domestic flights after Delta's pilots
objected. But airline executives privately admit that if the
Northwest-Continental alliance is permitted to go forward, the
other alliances seek similar rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: If you permit this one, how do you stop
United, Delta, and so on,'' said Alfred Kahn, who presided over
airline deregulation as head of the Civil Aeronautics board during
the Carter administration and is now an emeritus professor at
Cornell University. ``Maybe you can, but it is going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and Continental said Friday that their alliance will
result in an estimated $1.4 billion in consumer benefits, while
maintaining the independence of both carriers. Together, the two
carriers account for about 16 percent of domestic air traffic,
enabling them, they argued, to become a viable fourth challenger to
United, American and Delta, which each have between 17 and 20
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Northwest agreed to buy 14 percent of Continental's
shares, which represent 51 percent of all voting rights, from Air
Partners, a Texas investment group controlled by financier David
Bonderman, for $311 million in cash and 4.1 million shares of
Northwest stock.
</P>
<P>
   To insure Continental's independence, Northwest said that it
would place the shares in a trust. A set of independent directors
on Continental's board would control the votes, though Northwest
would retain the right to vote the shares in the event of a
takeover and a few other key circumstances determining
Continental's future.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department objected to the trust, which was to
expire after six years, Northwest offered to extend its life to 10
years. It also offered to submit to further restrictions on when it
would vote the shares and to remove a Northwest representative from
Continental's board.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest general counsel Douglas Steenland said that
negotiations with the government broke down earlier this week when
the Justice Department refused to back down from its demand that
Northwest give up majority voting rights after the trust expired.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Northwest was planning to acquire the Continental
shares on the more liberal terms it had offered the government,
which meant that many of the issues outlined in Friday's lawsuit
will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This complaint challenges a transaction that doesn't exist
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the government obviously disagrees. ``Anticompetitive
acquisitions cannot be cured by long-term voting trusts or other
artificial legal devices that leave one competitor in the hands of
another,'' Klein, the antitrust chief, said Friday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There they were, the heroes of the 1998 World
Champion New York Yankees, depicted in their uniforms on
baseball-card-style posters hung prominently across the facade of
City Hall: O'Neill. Wells. Hernandez. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani? Was he that scrappy backup shortstop? Or maybe that
middle reliever, the one called in to strike out lefties? Whoever
he is, he must be important. His poster was smack in the center of
every camera angle, right next to the manager, Joe Torre, while
posters of better-known players were relegated to the fringes of
the display, including Andy Pettitte, the pitcher who merely won
the fourth and final game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is neither a player nor coach
for the Yankees, despite his penchant for wearing pinstripes. But
he was the host of the city's exuberant celebration for the Yankees
Friday, and his aides made sure that he was duly recognized as the
team's No. 1 fan in some of the posters and banners plastered on
walls, railings and anything else that did not have a pulse in City
Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   Such self-promotional touches might be expected at a baseball
party thrown by a politician, but the challenge is in striking the
proper balance in emphasis. One City Council member, Stephen
DiBrienza of Brooklyn, found it all just a bit too much. ``It's
like Rudy's private party,'' he said, motioning to the
balloons-and-barricades celebration that had transformed a workday
Friday in lower Manhattan into something closer to a Mardi Gras
bacchanal.
</P>
<P>
   It did seem at times that politicians were threatening to steal
the spotlight from the Yankee players, coaches and executives. On
the dais facing the cameras and the crowd of 5,000 people, elected
officials took up most of the first-row seats, while the players
sat in the second and third rows.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to see Scott Brosius, the third-baseman and World
Series hero, you had to peer around some guy in a Yankee warm-up
jacket, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Also in a Yankee jacket was Gov.
George Pataki, who jokingly demonstrated the powers of his office
by presenting vanity license plates to certain Yankees.

DOW FALLS 80.8 AS STOCK RALLY TAKES A HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices retreated Friday, breaking a run of
seven advancing sessions, the longest in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   No particular news seemed to account for the broad downturn,
though the procession of quarterly earnings reports and company
projections again claimed casualties. The victory parade for the
New York Yankees was said to have held down midday volume.
</P>
<P>
   Even in decline, smaller companies continued to fare better than
the blue chips, with the Nasdaq market _ including some
high-technology giants _ easing 0.5 percent, or 8.78 points, to
1,693.86, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 1
percent, or 80.85 points, to 8,452.29. The Russell 2000, composed
of small companies, managed a marginal advance.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts seemed unfazed by the setback, regarding it as a
normal respite after an almost unbroken two-week advance that began
just as major indexes flirted with declines of 20 percent from
their peaks, the standard definition of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is due for a pause, especially before a weekend,''
said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``It
doesn't hurt to have some consolidation here, a little pullback.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some said the underpinnings of the extended
rise had been none too solid, as reflected in the unimpressive
volume of rising stocks compared with falling stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days, the quality of the rally has been mediocre
at best,'' said Nora McAuley, a technical analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``For a big up leg, you need to see 3-1 or better''
for the ratio of advancing to declining volume.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McAuley called the last two weeks an interim rally in a
downtrend and said it was ``not unlikely'' the market would slip
back and test its Oct. 8 lows.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were also lower in most foreign markets Friday. But
except for Brazil, where the Bovespa index slumped 4.36 percent,
none fell much more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contributors to the Dow's decline Friday were
Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which dropped 4, to 77 7/16,
after it reported a 9.3 percent profit decline. The stock fell 2
13/16 on Thursday. Next came Merck, J.P. Morgan and DuPont, all
down between 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've rolled 1,000 points'' from the Dow's Aug. 31 low, said
Philip Schettewi, managing partner at Loomis, Sayles in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think it's just natural short-term profit
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Among blue-chip gainers, Citigroup did best Friday, rising 1{,
to 46 9/16. Wal-Mart climbed 1 3/16, to 68, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
rose 1, to 84.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, computer and software stocks were mostly
lower. Microsoft, however, slumped 3|, to 106], following a sizable
gain, while Gateway beat earnings forecasts and rose 1~, to 51|.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust jumped 5{, to 66~, in a weak bank group. It said
it would turn a profit this month after having reported a huge
third-quarter loss. Brokerage stocks were mixed, with Schwab, up
1], to 45], the best performer after announcing a dividend increase
and a 3-for-2 split.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications, which hit a 52-week high Thursday, dropped 5
on Friday, to 56, in a broad retreat in cable company shares. At
least one analyst downgraded Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Other movers included Dole Food, down 5, to 29|, after warning
of poor third-quarter profits because of a world slump in banana
prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 637.6 million shares changed
hands, compared with 754.8 million Thursday. Losing issues
dominated winners, 1,709 to 1,292, with 33 issues making new lows
and 22 new highs.

CLINTON WIDELY PRAISED ON EFFORTS TOWARD PEACE ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a fatigued President Clinton disembarked from
the Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House
Friday afternoon, he gave a ``thumbs up'' to signal his pleasure
over the Middle East peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a day when the signs of approval were mostly directed
at him.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement that he helped broker not only ended a stalemate
between the Israelis and Palestinians over land and security
issues, it also to some extent ended a debate over the relevancy of
Bill Clinton's presidency, analyst said. And it promises to restore
some luster to a legacy that has been so profoundly muddled by the
Monica S. Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Just days away from midterm elections that could determine
whether Clinton is impeached or not, his success could not have
come at a more opportune time.
</P>
<P>
   The president's role in shepherding the agreement was hailed by
all sides in the negotiations, and gave Clinton a chance to display
his statesmanship as well as the persuasive powers that helped
catapult him to the presidency in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of peace in the Middle East cannot be
overstated,'' said Marc Landy, a Boston College political
scientist. ``And anything that's a step in that direction is
enormously valuable to him. This is a case that what is good for
the country, is good for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Friday's agreement ``is a very minor step forward'' in
Israeli-Palestinian relations, said Michael Mandelbaum, director of
American foreign policy studies at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies, ``it does inch the process forward,
and obviously Clinton played some role in that and should get some
of the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Feith, a Mideast specialist at the National Security
Council under President Reagan, said Clinton does not deserve
credit as a peacemaker because he has a history of promoting
agreements that are violated and not enforced, as in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better at making peace agreements than making peace,''
Feith said.
</P>
<P>
   The praise for Clinton was unqualified during an elaborate
signing ceremony Friday in the ornate East Room at the White House,
where Clinton received prolonged applause from the audience of
White House and State Department aides, members of Congress and
other dignataries.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan told Clinton that he had been friendly
with US presidents dating all the way back to Dwight Eisenhower,
and through the years had kept in touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the subject of peace, the peace we are seeking, I have
never, with all due respect and all the affection that I held for
your predecessors, have known someone with your dedication,
clearheadness, focus and determination to help resolve this issue
in the best possible way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, permit me to say what I feel,'' the king
continued. ``You have the tolerance and the patience of Job, and
you are the subject of our admiration and respect. And we hope that
you will be with us as we see greater successes and as we help our
brethren and our friends move towards a better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Clinton ``a
warrior for peace.'' He spoke of the president's ``ability to
maintain a tireless pace and to nudge and prod and suggest and use
a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore the possibilities of
both sides, and never just on one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Clinton ``was always alert
and understanding, creative in order to bring back history between
the cousins,'' and that for his efforts he has ``a special place in
our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spent more than 78 hours over nine days at the
secluded Wye plantation on Maryland's eastern shore pressing both
sides to come to agreement. At what was considered a turning point
in the marathon talks three days ago, Clinton sat down with the
Middle East leaders and did an inventory of the issues, summarized
where they were on them and the nature of the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   He postponed campaign appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday in
Los Angeles and San Francisco, and cleared most other business from
his schedule to focus on the talks. He shuttled back and forth from
the White House to the Wye plantation by helicopter, often arriving
at home between 1 and 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, he left the White House and did not return
until 3 p.m. Friday. He and the other Middle East leaders had
breakfast, lunch and dinner at the same table where the meeting was
held and stayed up all that night to work on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the White House Friday afternoon, his voice
was raspy, and the bags under his eyes were heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``all that was required of us was a listening ear
and a helpful suggestion now and then and a kind of determination
to keep us all moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke of ``difficult negotiations, very long, dare
I say quite sleepless'' negotiations with many ``twists and
turns,'' and that at one point Friday seemed to hit a snag over
Netanhayu's demand that the US release Jonathan Pollard, who was
convicted of spying for Israel. That obstacle was cleared after
Clinton agreed to review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Landy, the Boston College professor, said Friday's agreement
``adds a dimension that has been relatively weak with Clinton: He
can pretty well claim to be an important statesmen,'' despite the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this whole issue of whether he should be impeached, one of
the questions is how valuable is he, how much service does he
provide for the country,'' Landy said. Coming on top of his success
in negotating peace in Northern Ireland, ``this is the kind of
thing that really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is some lucky star that follows Clinton.''

giants _ easing 8.78 points, to 1,693.86. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 80.85 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 8,452.29. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.81 points, to 1,070.67.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices fell, reflecting the diminished allure of
U.S. government securities as a safe-haven investment. The price
declines pushed up the yield on the 30-year issue to 5.17 percent
from 5.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SCANDAL LEADS TO NEC RESIGNATION
</P>
<P>
   Tadahiro Sekimoto, the chairman of the computer-chip maker NEC,
has resigned that post to take responsibility for a
military-procurement scandal. He also resigned an influential post
at the Keidanren, Japan's largest business organization.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE RULES AGAINST ORANGE COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has rejected the main legal argument Orange
County has been using in its lawsuits against more than a dozen
securities firms in connection with the county's 1994 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   APPAREL MAKER ANNE KLEIN FOR SALE
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein &AMP; Co., the women's sportswear maker, is for sale and
industry executives estimate it could sell for $50 million to $100
million although it has been losing money for several years. The
company has brought in new designers, changed the name of its Anne
Klein II line to just Anne Klein, and started an advertising
campaign featuring well-known women politicians, executives and
athletes wearing its clothes to bolster sales.
</P>
<P>
   AMP LOST $76.3 MILLION IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   AMP, which is fighting off a proposed takeover by Allied Signal,
reported a third-quarter loss of $76.3 million, or 35 cents a
diluted share, and said it planned layoffs that would now total
4,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH INSURERS WARNED
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration threatened to impose fines on
insurance companies that refuse to sell coverage to elderly
Medicare beneficiaries. HMOs in 30 states have notified the
government that they are pulling out of Medicare or reducing their
service areas on Jan. 1, in part because their costs have risen
faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA PROPOSES OWN CURE
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia presented a 1999
budget intended to pull the economy out of its first recession in
more than a decade. The plan, which calls for tax cuts for favored
industries, reflects Mahathir's philosophy of spending more to
bolster corporate health and create employment. He blamed foreign
currency speculators and the International Monetary Fund for much
of Asia's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ELLINGTON CAPITAL COVERED ITS LOSSES
</P>
<P>
   Ellington Capital Management, the hedge fund firm in Old
Greenwich, Conn., that was forced to sell many of its holdings to
meet margin calls earlier this month, told its investors that the
losses in its three funds, while sizable, appeared to be limited.
</P>
<P>
   HEAD OF TELECOM ITALIA RESIGNS

THE HARD PART WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton Friday completed a rescue
operation on a dying Israeli-Palestinian peace process. It was high
diplomatic drama.
</P>
<P>
   But this interim agreement _ the fourth in five years since the
historic Oslo Accords were signed _ included virtually nothing that
has not already been agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of whether this agreement is a true breakthrough for
lasting peace, or a short-term political victory for Clinton after
eight days of indefatigable, daring diplomacy, will depend on its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   That is the hard part, and it will require mending a badly
frayed fabric of trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   What Friday's pact provides is the momentum to keep the process
moving forward, to ensure Israeli compliance in ceding more West
Bank land to Palestinians, and Palestinian compliance in combating
terrorism aimed at Israel. And it illustrates to the Arab world,
which questions American resolve, that the United States can be an
evenhanded broker in the region.
</P>
<P>
   If it succeeds, the agreement will build support for peace as
the two sides face the more profound and thornier issues that lie
ahead: Palestinian statehood, the fate of Jewish settlements, and
the status of Jerusalem _ which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   If this interim pact fails, it becomes a prelude to a much
larger crisis and, perhaps, armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
Authority president Yasser Arafat now leave the soft, verdant
landscape of the Wye Plantation in Maryland for the hard, rocky
hills of the disputed West Bank. And as these two leaders take
their first steps in pushing past a 19-month deadlock, they will
face a backlash by extremists _ both Jewish and Muslim _ intent on
destroying the process.
</P>
<P>
   The extremist threat looms as a more immediate and pressing
domestic political issue for Netanyahu. He faces hard-liners and
Jewish settlers who consider the agreement a betrayal and threaten
to topple his government. Netanyahu's first step will be to secure
the approval by his Cabinet of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Netanyahu will succeed, in large part because of a
savvy political partnership he has forged with the legendary
Israeli hawk Ariel Sharon, his new foreign minister. Sharon's
hulking presence at the Maryland summit, even if he refused to
shake Arafat's hand, provides immeasurable political cover for
Netanyahu from the far right.
</P>
<P>
   The next hurdle will be obtaining the approval for the agreement
in the 120-member Knesset, Israel's parliament. This will be a
tougher fight, but Sharon should help Netanyahu to marginalize the
extreme right-wing, which has constantly threatened to pull out of
the fragile 61-59 majority that keeps Netanyahu in power.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has also proven deft in co-opting the far right in
other ways. A classic example was Netanyahu's late bid to attach
the return of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard to the deal.
Netanyahu failed, at least for now. But the news of his insistence
reached Israel just before the start of the Sabbath, when the
religious right, for whom the release of Pollard is a deeply
emotional issue, turns off its radios and televisions until sundown
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 2 1/2 years of tough talk and intransigence on the peace
process, Netanyahu seems to have grasped political reality. Recent
polls indicated that 82 percent of Israelis want him to return with
an agreement. If he is to be reelected in 2000 _ or if the
Knesset's far right joins with the liberal Labor Party in calling
for new elections _ he must appear more centrist. So the summit, in
effect, was the start of Netanyahu's next political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something more profound to this agreement, and
its relucant acceptance by hard-liners like Sharon, than mere
domestic politics. If fulfilled, this new acceptance would mark a
dramatic shift in the philosophical underpinnings of the
conservative Likud Party, which has long held that the ``land of
Israel'' includes the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Likud's active engagement in the Oslo process proves that the
only difference between this conservative party and the more
liberal Labor Party is a matter of percentages on the withdrawal of
Israel troops from the West Bank, which was captured by Israel from
Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, a Labor member of the Knesset and one of the
architects of the Oslo process, said, ``This proves there is no
alternative to Oslo. To see Sharon, even if he was brought
childishly kicking and screaming to the process, is a very
significant victory for Oslo and hopefully for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis from both the political left and right appeared
confident that the agreement carries critical assurances for
Israeli security. It will force the Palestinian Authority to do
more to fight the ``infrastructure of terrorism'' which exists
within the militant Islamic movement, Hamas, a terrorist
organization that operates openly in Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also clarifies an issue that is of key
psychological importance for Israel: the repeal of the sections of
the Palestinian charter that call for the destruction of Israel.
Although the Palestinian National Council voted to annul those
sections in 1996, it has never actually rewritten the document. Now
Clinton plans to come to Gaza to see that it is done.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat can also return home with an important set of victories
that will improve the daily lives of Palestinians. Most important
is the further Israeli pullback from the West Bank. Under the plan,
Israeli troops will withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank, effectively putting it under shared control with
Palestinians. Another 14 percent of land currently under joint
control will shift to full Palestinian control. This will leave the
Palestinians with 40 percent of the West Bank under either full or
shared control. The opening of the Palestinian airport and roads
that will connect Gaza to parts of the West Bank are also hugely
important to the economic livelihood and social fabric of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Arab world remains skeptical. Just as the Israelis
feel that Palestinians have broken promises on security,
Palestinians feel that the Netanyahu government has made promises
it has not kept.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israeli and Palestinian analysts point out that the
agreement fails in one critical area. It does not directly address
the looming deadline next May 4 _ the date by which the original
Oslo Accords were to be completed. Arafat has vowed to declare
unilaterally an independent state at that point. The Israelis have
countered that such an act would be a violation of the Oslo
agreement and would consider prior agreements null and void.

POLLARD'S CONVICTION FOR SPYING REMAINS A DIVISIVE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add total of 400 wds of new material after grafs. 5 and 10
on Pollard and the type of information he gave to the Israelis.)  (See also: MIDEAST-ACCORD, MIDEAST-ASSESS, MIDEAST-SPY,

 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 13 years, the case against the convicted spy Jonathan Jay
Pollard has symbolized darker aspects of the normally warm
relationship between the United States and Israel while also
exposing fissures long dividing American and Israeli Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the Pollard case has emerged from the diplomatic
wings and crept toward center stage whenever U.S. and Israeli
leaders have sat down to talk. Rarely, though, has it been the
dominant force that it suddenly became on Friday, when it looked
for a while as though it might unsettle the latest peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite strong emotions in both Israel and this country
produced by Pollard's life sentence, the exact nature of his crimes
has never been fully clear.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters demanding his release from a federal prison in North
Carolina say he has served more than enough time, arguing that he
handed Israel strategic information that in their view the United
States should have been sharing with an ally from the start.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are officials of U.S. security agencies and
the Justice Department who say it is impossible to overstate the
damage that Pollard's espionage inflicted on U.S.
intelligence-gathering in the Middle East and possibly also in the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   From bits and pieces that the Defense Department has made
available to the courts, it is evident that Pollard gave the
Israelis intelligence on hostile Arab countries, including chemical
weapons production in Iraq and Syria, and Libya's air-defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Samson Option,'' his 1991 book on Israel's nuclear
program, Seymour Hersh wrote that Pollard also supplied top-secret
data on the Soviet Union's defenses, including the location of its
military targets. The Israelis, Hersh said, passed along some of
this material to Moscow as a goodwill gesture, presumably to
encourage more liberal emigration policies for Soviet Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this has been confirmed by Washington, which has
never laid out precisely what Pollard did, except to say that it
was serious _ a view that thus far has been sustained by three U.S.
presidents: Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Pollard acted on behalf of a friendly nation was
irrelevant, the chief prosecutor in the Pollard case, Joseph
diGenova, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't have two standards for spying,''
said diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
``It's all bad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollard, now 44, was a civilian intelligence analyst for the
Navy in 1984 when he and his wife, Anne Henderson Pollard, began
feeding Israeli agents thousands of pages of highly classified data
from intelligence reports, electronic intercepts and satellite
photographs. The material was vast. Federal agents estimated that
if it was all put together, the stacks would stretch 6-feet wide,
6-feet long and 10-feet high.
</P>
<P>
   A bearded, somewhat bookish man, Pollard keenly felt his Jewish
identity, having grown up in South Bend, Ind., where his father
taught at Notre Dame and where he was the only Jew in his grade
school.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided in the mid-1980s that intelligence material in
his grasp had to be passed along to Israel, he worked through
several Israeli handlers. One of them was Raphael Eitan, a
spymaster who had taken part in the 1960 kidnapping of the Nazi war
criminal Adolf Eichmann, taking him from Argentina to Israel for
trial and eventual execution.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1985, it became clear to Jonathan and Anne Pollard
that the FBI was on their trail. They sought refuge in the Israeli
Embassy in Washington, only to be turned away at the gate and
arrested by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pollard, now divorced and living in Israel, was sentenced
in 1987 to five years in prison. But to the shock of some, a
federal judge handed her husband a life sentence. That put Pollard
in the same category as spies like John Walker and Aldrich Ames,
who sold secrets not to an ally but to the enemy Soviet Union.

GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER ONE OF JAPAN'S BIGGEST BANKS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the first nationalization of a Japanese bank since
World War II, the government decided Friday to take over the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's biggest
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover, a prelude to sorting out the bank's bad loans and
eventually selling it to another institution, represents the start
of a $509 billion plan aimed at stabilizing battered banks and
reviving the economy. While Japan still is locked in its worst
recession in half a century, some analysts say they have some hope
that the country may muddle through its financial and economic
crisis a bit more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the outlook has changed quite dramatically,'' said
Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.
``Now I think the pieces are beginning to fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koo was quick to add that Japan will continue to release
some horrible numbers for months to come. ``If you took a snapshot
of the economy on Oct. 23, 1998, it's still in a state of
meltdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is expected to shrink by at least 1.8 percent in
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999, and with the nation's wobbly
banks reluctant to lend, the country's flow of credit has started
to dry up. The troubles in the Japanese economy are worsening
Asia's economic crisis and increasing the risk of a global
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that Japan may be able to deal with its banking
problem, a growing number of banks said today that they were
interested in applying for government money to bolster their
capital. These include Industrial Bank of Japan, Tokai Bank, and
Daiwa Bank _ while Fuji Bank Ltd., Sakura Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank
Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the Mitsubishi Trust and
Banking Corp. and others said they were considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The government approved a $509 billion bank bailout, but until
the last few days it had seemed that many institutions would not
take part because they believed the conditions were too onerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks getting on board is an important hurdle, and we're
still in midair, but it looks like we're going to clear this
thing,'' said James P. Fiorillo, banking analyst at ING Barings in
Tokyo. ``But there's nothing yet in the package that guarantees
that the government isn't going to abuse these measures and take us
backwards again.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks argue that the financial strength of many of their clients
has deteriorated, so that even if they had more money to lend, they
would not necessarily want to do so for fear that they might not be
repaid. The government's bank bailout is intended to push the banks
to lend money and help revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say this is in itself a problem: the government's
blueprint for reviving the economy and dealing with the debt crisis
may depend in part on encouraging banks to make more bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the government is telling them, `Do not be good
banks, please give this money to bad companies,''' said Craig O.
Chudler, strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``That's why
the market may be skeptical. Do you want to be investing in a
market where they're creating more distortions than are already
there?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement of the nationalization of Long-Term Credit came
as two long-awaited banking bills went into effect Friday. Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi promptly took advantage of the new
legislation to announce that the government would temporarily take
control of Long-Term Credit.
</P>
<P>
   The government stressed that it would guarantee all Long-Term
Credit's obligations, from its complex derivatives deals to the
debentures and deposits held by individuals. Obuchi said that the
government put the bank under state control to avoid a cutoff of
credit to the bank's longtime corporate borrowers, many of which
are ailing but still able to repay their debt.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit told Obuchi early this morning that it could
ultimately default on some of its obligations to creditors. The
potential collapse of one of the nation's largest institutions had
worried markets for months.
</P>
<P>
   After months of insisting that Long-Term Credit was solvent,
Japan's Financial Supervisory Authority, which audits the banks,
acknowledged Friday that at the end of September, the bank had a
negative net worth of 340 billion yen, or $2.9 billion, if its huge
paper losses were absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government will probably buy the common shares
of Long-Term Credit at a price that is virtually zero. The
supervisory authority also reported that the bank had $11.2 billion
in loans that were likely to be unrecoverable, with another $28
billion with questionable prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The government is to separate out the bank's bad loans and try
to liquidate or collect on them, though many are to firms in
hard-hit, politically powerful industries like retailing and
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange will remove Long-Term Credit's listing
from the exchange, and next week, the bank's board members will
resign after the government selects a new management team. After it
reorganizes the bank's loan portfolio, the government hopes to
resell Long-Term Credit to another institution to preserve its
operations.

<P>
   TODAY'S KEY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 UCLA (5-0) at CALIFORNIA (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could be upset by worse. The Bears give up just 18.7
points a game and their defeats have come against Washington
(21-13) and Nebraska (24-3). UCLA quarterback Cade McNown has a
chance to snowball his Heisman momentum after a 395-yard,
3-touchdown performance in last week's 41-38 overtime victory over
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 FLORIDA STATE (6-1) No. 6 at GEORGIA TECH (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' national and Atlantic Coast Conference
championship hopes face a serious threat. Tech leads the league in
scoring at 40.8 points per game. Florida State leads the nation in
total defense at 214.1 yards a game. What is with the Yellow
Jackets' bend and bend some more defense? The unit surrendered 600
yards to Virginia last week but has scored in five straight games,
a major college record.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 MISSOURI (5-1) at No. 8 NEBRASKA (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers have been vulnerable against the rush, and
Missouri is capable of capitalizing. Devin West (175 yards a game)
leads a Tiger team averaging 266.3 yards on the ground. Of course,
Nebraska still has a running game of its own, averaging 270.4
yards. The loser in this Big 12 North showdown can probably say
goodbye to any chance of beating Kansas State to the conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS TECH (6-1) at No. 7 TEXAS A&AMP;M (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have kept improving after a season-opening defeat to
Florida State. Saturday, A&AMP;M's Butkus semifinalist, Dat Nguyen (70
tackles), seeks out Tech's Ricky Williams, the nation's
third-leading rusher with 1,168 yards. The Red Raiders can grab a
share of the Big 12's South division lead with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (3-2) at NO. 16 WEST VIRGINIA (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   This is the Big East's most important game of the week. Still
not moved? The Mountaineers begin a telling stretch with Virginia
Tech and Syracuse to follow. They will likely have the services of
Amos Zereoue, who needs 139 yards to become the league's all-time
rusher. West Virginia's Marc Bulger is throwing for a conference
best 278 yards a game. The Hurricanes had last week off to heal
from a humbling 26-14 defeat to Florida State. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 7 a.m., after a long night of bargaining ended
with handshakes and, it seemed, a peace agreement, the Israeli
prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, met alone with President
Clinton and made one last demand: As part of the deal, the United
States had to free Jonathan Pollard, the American serving life in
prison for spying for Israel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several hours at the Wye River Conference Center,
American officials scrambled to hold together an agreement that had
taken nine days to negotiate. Netanyahu said he would refuse to
sign the accord without Pollard's release, officials said, even as
Israeli television and radio stations reported his freedom had
already been won, infuriating the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought it was over,'' a senior administration
official said, describing the frantic negotiations that followed
the early-morning handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides sharply disputed the reasons for the snag, with
the Americans accusing Netanyahu of throwing up last-minute
demands, while the Israelis said he was simply trying to nail down
something they believed Clinton had promised earlier in the talks:
a pardon for Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged that the fate of Pollard, a Navy intelligence analyst,
had been discussed at Wye but not, they insisted, as part of the
agreement announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But even the discussion of Pollard's release caught officials at
the Pentagon and within the nation's intelligence community by
surprise, reviving the deep anger still felt in those quarters
about Pollard's espionage and raising concern that a process has
now been set in motion that, for political reasons, will result in
freedom for an admitted spy.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Pollard, whose cause has been championed by many
Jews in Israel and the United States, could well help Netanyahu
with his own right wing as he sells a new peace agreement
negotiated with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And one administration official, speaking on the condition that
he not be identified, suggested that Pollard could be released at a
later date to promote the peace process. But the official suggested
that any possible release of Pollard would be announced in a way
that appeared separate from Friday's agreement, comparable to how
the United States quietly withdrew its nuclear missiles from Turkey
shortly after the Soviet Union withdrew its nuclear missiles from
Cuba during the missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the president refused Netanyahu's demand to release
Pollard. But before Netanyahu agreed Friday afternoon to proceed
with the accord, he wrung a public statement from Clinton that he
would reconsider Pollard's longstanding pleas for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to Pollard, I have agreed to review this matter
seriously, at the prime minister's request,'' Clinton said at the
ceremony in the East Room of the White House, where the agreement
was signed. ``I have made no commitment as to the outcome of the
review.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollard, a 43-year-old graduate of Stanford University who
attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University, is now serving his sentence at the federal prison in
Butner, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   His case is considered one of the most damaging in American
history, even though the recipient of the classified material he
passed along was the strongest American ally in the Middle East and
not, as in so many other cases, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was a civilian analyst for the Navy's Anti-Terrorist
Alert Center in Suitland, Md., when he and his wife at the time,
Anne, were arrested by FBI agents on Nov. 21, 1985, after being
turned away by guards at Israel's Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was charged with _ and later pleaded guilty to _ giving
the Israelis thousands of pages of documents, photographs and other
highly classified material over 18 months starting in 1984,
delivering them in a suitcase to an apartment house in Northwest
Washington. In return, he and his wife received at least $45,000 in
cash, gifts and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Israel only officially acknowledged Pollard as its spy
last May, his fate has been a source of contention with the United
States. Israel has repeatedly asked for his release in recent
years, but first President Bush and then Clinton refused to grant a
pardon or clemency.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Clinton has promised Israeli
officials to reconsider the case. He did so in November 1993 at the
request of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, but four months later he
accepted a recommendation against clemency from his law enforcement
and national security aides. Clinton rejected clemency a second
time in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and the nation's intelligence agencies have been
the most adamant forces fighting Pollard's release, arguing that he
gravely compromised American intelligence sources and methods by
passing information to the Israelis. On the eve of Pollard's
sentencing in 1987, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
submitted a classified affidavit to the sentencing judge calling
for a severe sentence, citing ``the magnitude of treasons
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton first considered the case in 1993, the secretary of
defense at the time, Les Aspin, released a report accusing Pollard
of continuing to release classified information in letters he wrote
from his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former military and intelligence officials expressed
shock and outrage that the White House would even consider
Pollard's release in the context of Israeli and Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why anybody on our side would be throwing
Pollard into this mix,'' said a Navy official who recalled
firsthand the dismay the service felt when Pollard's case arose.
``It makes them look desperate for the deal. It's just dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Redmond, a former chief of counter-intelligence at the CIA,
said that if Pollard were released, the director of central
intelligence, George Tenet, who played a critical role in the talks
at Wye, would not be ``upholding his duty'' to protect ``sources
and methods'' of gathering intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   David Boren, a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said releasing Pollard should be weighed on its own
merits, not as part of the larger Middle East agreement. ``It was
such a breach of intelligence,'' Boren said. ``I don't think that
should be bargained away as part of other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, the Republican chairman of the intelligence
committee, released a statement Friday strongly objecting to the
possibility of Pollard's release, saying it would be ``an extremely
unwise, inconsistent and very dangerous action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives Clinton the authority to pardon those
convicted of federal crimes or to commute their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is still worried enough about the knowledge Pollard
possesses that it required an intelligence officer to be present
when Pollard met with Israeli officials in prison last May _ and
demanded that everyone speak English.

GAP BETWEEN PARTY FUNDS GROWS IN RACES FOR CONGRESS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Party fund raising has exceeded the
Democrats' by more than $110 million in the current congressional
campaign, and in a year that campaign finance reform faltered in
Congress, unregulated donations to both parties more than doubled
from the 1994 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Filings that arrived at the Federal Election Commission on
Thursday, as the congressional races move into the final days, show
that, as of Sept. 30, combined donations to all national party
committees have risen by more than 50 percent from the same date in
1994: Republican committees have raised $284 million, compared with
$185 million in 1994; Democrats have raised $174 million, compared
with $111 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the gap between Republican and Democratic party fund
raising growing to more than $100 million, up from $70 million in
the 1994 election, Democrats have been forced to pursue a more
bare-bones campaign as the election nears, while Republicans are
about to embark on a $25 million advertising blitz in crucial
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is an important issue, and we've had a lot of money
against us,'' said Democratic National Committee chairman Roy
Romer. ``A lot of money will be pushed out in the last days. They
have a history of money on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Money raised by national party committees is used primarily to
promote congressional candidates and is in addition to money the
candidates raise themselves. A large portion of the national money
is unrestricted, or ``soft money,'' donations, long criticized by
campaign finance reformers as a way of supporting candidates
outside of federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to outlaw soft money, which is supposed to finance party
expenses like polling, television advertisements and mailings, and
is not given directly to candidates, failed in Congress in the face
of strong opposition by the Republican majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly striking in the current report is the sharp growth
in soft-money donations to both parties. Soft money donations to
both parties rose by $100 million in this election cycle, compared
with the 1994 election. Republican soft money donations rose to
$100 million from $35 million in 1994, while Democratic soft money
donations reached $76 million, compared with $40 million in 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The critical money in the 1998 congressional races is the soft
money being spent by the congressional party committees on phony
issue ads,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
nonprofit group that advocates the overhauling of campaign finance
laws. ``This clearly violates existing federal regulations, and it
is the soft money that is finding its way directly into
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tough fund-raising year for Democrats. The
Democratic National Committee, wracked by a campaign finance
scandal and the heavy legal bills it generated, raised $97 million
since the beginning of the election cycle on Jan. 1, 1997. This
year the party faced a $15 million debt from the campaign finance
scandal, along with $12 million in legal fees. That debt has been
whittled to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republican National Committee has raised $131
million to date. Moreover, other party committees raising money
specifically for Democratic House and Senate candidates have raised
about half of what Republican counterpart committees have raised:
$85 million for the Democrats, compared with $151 million for the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in enough races to get our message out,'' said Matt
Angle, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which raises money for House races. ``We can't close the
gap financially. But we think we have enough. ''
</P>
<P>
   A party committee set up to help Republican Senate candidates is
taking in $300,000 a day, and a fund-raiser it sponsored a few
weeks ago to celebrate the Republican Senate majority took in $7
million. The committee, which has a budget of $75 million to be
used for Republican Senate candidates, has spent more than $5
million in television ads on top of the $25 million planned by a
Republican House fund-raising committee for its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, a fund-raising committee for House
candidates, said they have directed money to nearly 90 House races,
both in direct donations as well as in soft dollar support.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any given year, the competitive playing field is around 100
seats. But it's gotten bigger closer to the election,'' she said.
``The Clinton scandal has put more Democratic seats in play than
before.''

SHORT ITEMS ON INVESTING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a market observation that may leave investors scratching
their heads. Since August, the price-to-earnings ratio of the Dow
Jones utilities average has tended to levitate above that of the
Dow Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   As of Oct. 19, the P/E on the utilities was 22.20 percent, while
that of the industrials was just 21.31 percent. Usually,
industrials have a far higher P/E; according to Charles B. Carlson,
co-manager of the Strong Dow 30 Value fund, that has been the case
for the last seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   What's feeding the phenomenon? First, there's investor hunger
for safety in utilities. Perhaps more important is that utilities,
which tend to be interest-rate sensitive, are benefiting from
falling rates.
</P>
<P>
   But such an anomaly may be a warning. ``I can't remember seeing
something like that except in a recession,'' said Timothy Vick,
editor of the newsletter Today's Value Investor. If it is a bad
portent, however, investors can take heart: the industrials' sprint
last week put its P/E at 21.94, just above the 21.58 of the
utilities

   The rich money may not be so dumb after all. Despite the
much-publicized woes at Long-Term Capital Management and other
hedge funds, investors in such investment vehicles appear to have
fared far better in the recent market downturn than those who
plowed their money into stocks or run-of-the-mill mutual funds,
according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, a Nashville
consulting firm that compiles an index of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent quarter, ended Sept. 30, the average hedge
fund lost less money than stock mutual funds or the broad stock
indexes. The Van U.S. Hedge Fund index was down 6.1 percent,
compared with drops of 9.9 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index and 15 percent for the average stock fund,
according to Van.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners: market timers, some of whom presumably were out
of the market and were up 2.8 percent for the quarter, and
short-sellers, who racked up gains of nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, last quarter was no fluke. In examining the last
seven quarters of major market declines, Van found that the average
domestic hedge fund had a cumulative loss of just 3.2 percent,
versus cumulative losses of 29.4 percent in the S&AMP;P 500 and 35.1
percent for the average stock fund.

</P>

   Contestants have to guess three simple figures: the yield on the
newly issued 30-year United States Treasury bond at the close of
trading, 4 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 17; the Chicago Board of Trade

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ True or false: The Federal Reserve's recent
interest-rate cuts, and those expected forthwith, will forestall an
economic recession in the United States and lower the risk that
credit will dry up across the economy.
</P>
<P>
   True, said the stock market as it meandered upward last week. In
one of the calmest five-day trading stretches in months, the Dow
Jones industrial average closed at 8,452.29, up 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, however, isn't sure that all is well yet. Smoke
signals from much of the non-Treasury bond markets say a recession
remains a possibility. Moreover, while it is unclear whether banks
have stopped lending to good customers, the bond markets are still
gripped by catalepsy. And so a credit crisis might start there.
</P>
<P>
   Because movements of various fixed-income instruments, like
mortgage-backed securities and high-yield bonds, aren't as easily
tracked as stocks, what the bond market is saying isn't immediately
evident. But one sign of continued fear among these investors is
the difference between the yields they demand on junk bonds and
those paid by Treasury securities with like maturities. This
difference is known as the spread.
</P>
<P>
   When investors embrace risk, as they did last spring, spreads
between Treasury issues and more speculative debt are narrow. As
investors rush into riskier bonds, their prices rise and yields
decline. When investors shun risk, as they are now, spreads widen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Fed's latest reduction in interest rates, on Oct.
15, spreads remain wide by historical standards. The estimated
yield on Salomon Smith Barney's index of high-yield bonds exceeds
that on Treasuries by 6.82 percentage points, compared with a
5.3-point spread before the rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spread is reflecting a great concern that the economic
environment is not very healthy and that, if anything, surprises
will be on the downside,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer
of the BankBoston Corp. Riley agrees with the market and expects
corporate earnings to be chronically disappointing for six to nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty spread on junk bonds is also a sign that the huge
market for these corporate bonds is still frozen. As a result, the
credit squeeze that the Fed fretted about when it lowered rates
remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   According to Riley, credit contractions can happen for two
reasons. One is a result of restrictive moves by bank regulators.
The other is more emotional, with lenders pulling back from loans
more out of fear of default than its reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the emotional action we have to worry about now,'' Riley
said. ``As lenders become gun-shy, they can create a credit squeeze
even without monetary authorities being a catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the interest in credit spreads. If they narrow, it will
mean that lenders are becoming more optimistic about their
customers' prospects. If they stay wide, a credit contraction is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Both stock and bond investors think the Fed's recent rate cuts,
though welcome, are not enough. Indeed, many are hoping for a
one-half-point slash in the federal funds rate at the next Federal
Open Market Committee meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
   These hopes could be dashed. Late last week, several Fed members
started telegraphing that further rate cuts were not necessarily a
given. In a speech on Thursday, J. Alfred Broaddus, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said said the risk that the
economy's growth rate could accelerate _ aka inflation _ hadn't
vanished. And, he said, the Fed cannot ``be held hostage'' to the
markets on interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has shrugged this off. So far. &QL;

<P>
   As chief economist at Salomon Brothers in the late 1970s and
early '80s, Dr. Henry Kaufman was known on Wall Street as ``Dr.
Doom'' for his dire predictions about government deficits and
interest rates. Those forecasts, which often summoned jeers from
his more optimistic peers, clearly earned more for him than
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kaufman gave $10 million to the Stern School of
Business at New York University, where he is chairman of the board
of overseers. Part of the money will pay for the expansion of the
newly renamed Henry Kaufman Management Education Center.
</P>
<P>
   Since he left Salomon to form his own firm in 1988, Kaufman has
periodically reprised his favored role, warning about, among other
things, financial euphoria in emerging markets. Again recently,
those warnings proved prescient. And of the market excesses that
have ended in turmoil, Kaufman said they ``would not have come to
the fore had there been a greater sense of fiduciary
responsibility'' among ``those who go forth into the financial
world.'' Good subject for a business school course?

   When David A. Coulter resigned last week as president of the
BankAmerica Corp. after huge losses there, he said the decision was
``extremely difficult for me, both personally and professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it difficult financially? Because of an unusual
arrangement, Coulter, 51, is guaranteed a pension equal to 95
percent of his combined salary and bonus last year of $5.24
million, meaning he gets $4.98 million a year until his death.
(Pensions of 50 percent to 60 percent are more common for senior
executives approaching a more traditional retirement age.)
</P>
<P>
   Coulter may have resigned to show he is willing to fall on his
sword. ``But what they didn't tell you,'' said Graef Crystal, the
compensation expert, ``was that there were 100 pillows between him
and the sword.''

   Sixty-three years ago, his father made a perilous flight from
Racine, Wis., to Brazil in an amphibious airplane nicknamed the
``Ugly Duckling,'' to look for wax-producing carnauba palm trees in
the wilderness. To commemorate the event, Samuel C. Johnson, 70,
the chairman of the privately held S.C. Johnson &AMP; Son, took off on
Thursday from the same town for the same destination with his sons,
Curtis and Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   And they flew in a replica of the craft, a Sikorsky S-38, which
Johnson said was once called a ``collection of airplane parts
trying to fly in formation.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey should be a lot safer than it was for his father,
H.F. Johnson Jr., in 1935. ``Then, there were no navigational aids,
no beacons, no runways,'' he said. ``You couldn't find out whether
there was a hurricane in the Caribbean unless a ship got caught in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father found his prize in northeastern Brazil. Now, his son
says, the family is donating nearly $3 million to the Nature
Conservancy to establish an 18,000-acre nature reserve in the area,
home to jaguars, ostrich-like birds called rheas, rare bats and
exotic plant species.

   Lots of executives come into their offices on weekends, but how
many hover above them? That's what George Tanaka, Fuji Photo Film
USA's new president, did last Sunday. He went for a ride on the
Fuji blimp, figuring he'd get an up-close look at the airship's new
artwork and talk promotional strategy with its captain, John
McHugh.
</P>
<P>
   No problem on the 20-minute, 10-mile float from Westchester
Airport to Fuji's home in Elmsford, N.Y. But headwinds that gusted
up to 31 miles per hour dragged the return trip out to 35 minutes,
probably creating enough turbulence to keep Tanaka from admiring
the fall foliage below.

special three-part series on the changing nature of adoption in
America.

<P>
   The stories will move in two forms: full length as published in
The New York Times, and abridged (less than half the length of the
original version). They will move tonight, Sunday and Monday, in
the ``a'' news file and are for publication beginning Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday and thereafter.

<P>
   ADOPTION-CHANGES _ In the last decade, as Americans have become
more candid about their private lives, adoption has gone public.
Open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is
becoming increasingly common _ before birth and after _ and the
fact of adoption is shared with the child, relatives and even
strangers. In some urban centers, such as New York City, San
Francisco and Boston, playgrounds are peppered with parents of
various races and nationalities chasing adopted children of other
races. Many of those families are headed by single people, older
and gay people _ men and women who, in years past, would have been
rejected by agencies and lawyers as unsuitable parents. By Esther
B. Fein. (Approximate length: 5,700 words.)
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-ECONOMICS _ Adoption in America is governed by an
economic equation of supply and demand, with unhappily infertile
couples competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white
American-born infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the
adoption world are calling a crisis, allowing money to determine
who will succeed in a desperate quest for that which cannot be
legally bought or sold. To find their babies, adoptive parents will
pay on average $15,000 to $20,000, even if they have to mortgage
their futures; a few, who have the money for intermediaries to do
the work, pay up to $100,000. The scarcity has created a cast of
thousands of such intermediaries, leaving only the thinnest line
between buying a child and buying adoption services that lead to a
child. By Laura Mansnerus. (Approximate length: 5,000 words.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-MATCHING _ In New Jersey, officials are taking an
aggressive approach to finding adoptive homes for the 100 or so
children in foster care who have no immediate prospects. With a
$600,000 budget, the state advertises and promotes, has an adoption
web site, and sponsors ``match events'' _ special parties where
prospective parents and children can get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-RACE _ As cross-racial adoption has become more
accepted, families like the Goldens of North Olmstead, Ohio, with
four children _ one white, one black and two Hispanic _ have begun
to melt some of the boundaries that define racial territory. But
because the adoption process spotlights a family's deepest feelings
about race and culture, it has created a marketplace in which white
children usually cost more than blacks, and children from Asian
orphanages are more highly valued than those in American foster
care. Many groups and activities have been established to reinforce
the heritage of children adopted by parents of other races; still,
family adjustment can be difficult, and some blacks continue to
oppose the adoption of black children by white families as a form
of betrayal. By Tamar Lewin. (Approximate length: 5,000 words.)

both 27- year-olds born of one black parent and one white parent,

opposing views, they almost embody the whole debate over
transracial adoption.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much digital mayhem the world will face
when the year 2000 arrives. Filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission suggest that repair and contingency planning
projects are just now building up steam at many companies.
</P>
<P>
   That might lead to the assumption that companies helping
corporate America battle the so-called millennium bug have a rosy
earnings outlook. But the Bloomberg Year 2000 index of 34 stocks in
this field has lost 34.6 percent this year, compared with a gain of
11.7 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   A second year-2000 index, designed by Peter de Jager, a
well-known year-2000 consultant, is down 8.8 percent this year even
though it defines the year-2000 universe more broadly than
Bloomberg does.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Let's start by recalling the story line that
once thrilled investors in these stocks: Big problems will arise
from the fact that many computers use just two digits to represent
years, and do not recognize ``00'' as 2000. Some machines read
``00'' as 1900; others are flat-out mystified. Analysts have
projected that as much as $600 billion will be spent to solve the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Investors started searching for year-2000 beneficiaries in the
mid-1990s, even before most companies started working on the
problem. Established software and computer companies responded by
developing and spotlighting their year-2000 wares.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Viasoft Inc. and the Computer Horizons Corp., used
the rising interest as a springboard for going public. The Zitel
Corp., a specialist in computer memory devices, bought an interest
in a small year-2000 code repair company, the Matridigm Corp., in
1995; Zitel's stock, which had been languishing at about $5, surged
to more than $60 by late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, year-2000 stocks outperformed the market by a wide
margin in 1996 and 1997. Even including the underperformance this
year, the Bloomberg index is still up 34.9 percent, annualized,
since the beginning of 1996, compared with just 21.4 percent for
the S&AMP;P 500. And the de Jager index is up 35.8 percent, annualized.
</P>
<P>
   The time is long past, though, for the strategy that Damian
Rinaldi, who follows the sector for the First Albany Corp.,
described as ``buy a basket and empty it as the leaders emerge.''
Over the past year, more and more investors have begun treating
many year-2000 companies as yesterday's investment fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``During 1997, anything associated with the year 2000 got a
premium,'' said Stan Corker, director of technology research at
Emerald Research, a Lancaster, Pa., firm whose clients include
institutions and mutual funds. ``Now, investors are more concerned
with whether these companies will fall off a cliff on Jan. 1,
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, there can be steep price declines at almost any sign
of earnings or revenue shortfalls. Viasoft is trading at $4.9375,
down from its 52-week high of $44 last October. Peritus Software
Services, a company that, like Viasoft, automates the search for
year-2000 problems, plummeted late last year and now trades at
$1.09375, down from a high of $29.125 last October. Data
Dimensions, which hit its 52-week high of $35.50 a year ago, now
trades at $15.125. And Zitel closed at $3.34375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These and other hard-hit companies are all associated with the
first stages of year-2000 projects: assessing where the problems
lie and repairing the right computer code. Although revenues and
earnings grew rapidly at first, they appear to have peaked sooner _
and at lower levels _ than Wall Street had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Much corporate spending seems to be going not toward repairs but
toward avoiding the problem by buying new computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot has been companies like Compuware that have
emphasized not just their repair capabilities but also so-called
later-stage tools like software for testing completed repairs.
Stocks of companies like Keane Inc., with broader information
management skills, fared better than the Viasofts of the year-2000
universe, but have also weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Keane, for example, has probably seen its year-2000 business
peak at $102 million, or 37 percent of revenues, in its most recent
quarter, according to Richard Park, a securities analyst at Merrill
Lynch. Now investors may be wondering how quickly its year-2000
work will tail off and how rapidly it can win new outsourcing
contracts and other business from big corporate computer users.
Keane's shares are at $31.75, down from their peak of $60.9375 on
July 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for everyone is whether year 2000 is a long-term
source of leverage with clients or whether it will disappear
without a trace,'' said Rinaldi of First Albany. He and many others
say that year-2000 stocks will remain volatile but that investors
have become too gloomy about many of them.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains a buy on Keane, and strong buys on Compuware,
Mercury Interactive and Cognicase. ``Y2K has been a catalyst for
growth for all of them but it's not dominant,'' Rinaldi said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Emerald Research maintains buys on Keane and the
Mastech Corp., a leader in outsourcing remediation work to
programmers in India.
</P>
<P>
   Also seeing possibilities in the sector is Thomas Dorsey,
president of Dorsey Wright and Associates, a Richmond firm that
specializes in technical analysis. ``The de Jager index can spring
back just as fast as it fell,'' Dorsey said, and he recommends that
investors buy call options on it.
</P>
<P>
   Major index components that have minor year-2000 exposure, like
Unisys and the EMC Corp., are in good shape, he said, and several
others, including Keane, are ``great bottom-fishing plays.''

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday night at Le Cirque 2000, dinners were flying
out of the kitchen like baseballs from a batting machine. In a
matter of four hours, over 300 diners would be decadently fed,
plied with wine, and sent home filled with black truffles and
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Camelo, 26, a cook whose arms are striped with burn scars,
was working the meat station. When an order of beef tenderloin was
ready to go, the saute cook handed it to him on top of a cloth
napkin. Camelo sprinkled it with chopped parsley and coarse salt
and placed it on a heated plate, atop a mound of glistening
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   He ladled on the sauce, made earlier in the day by the saucier,
and then walked the finished dish over to Sottha Khunn, the
executive chef, who looked it over, covered it with a silver dome
and, with a flick of his wrist, signaled for the plate to be
delivered to an expectant diner.
</P>
<P>
   Camelo did this all night long. He plated food and poured sauce.
Food. Sauce. Food. Sauce. And not just this particular evening.
This is his routine six nights a week. His pay is $12.55 an hour.
And his is a highly sought-after job in the cooking world _ a field
gaining a reputation as one filled with opportunity, fame and
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity certainly abounds. With the strong economy and the
steady increase in two-worker households, more people are eating
out. And as more restaurants open, the demand for restaurant
workers just keeps growing. According to projections by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, food preparation and service will be the
fastest-growing occupations through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Among chefs, cooks and kitchen workers alone, the government
expects an average of 1.27 million jobs to be created each year.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the job openings, there can be only one executive
chef in every restaurant. And there are even fewer star chefs, the
ones who clone their prestigious restaurants and turn themselves
into hot ``brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, where there are more restaurants than in any
other city in the United States, only five have won four-star
ratings from The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In a simpler time, succeeding as a chef was primarily about
talent and the ability to endure the long hours and physical
demands. Today, though, rising to the top of the profession _
becoming the next Sottha Khunn or Jean Georges Vongerichten, of
Manhattan's Jean Georges, JoJo and Vong _ involves much more.
</P>
<P>
   It takes careful planning and networking, years of sharp-elbowed
ladder-climbing in the kitchen and, usually, a large financial
investment on which the return will probably be slow.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, you must learn to cook. This year, there were
740 cooking school programs in the United States, compared with 360
in 1989. That count includes vacation classes for cooking
enthusiasts, vocational school and community college programs, and
academies like the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The largest schools that offer cooking programs _ like the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.; the New England
Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt., and Johnson &AMP; Wales
University in Providence, R.I. _ are full-blown colleges with two-
and four-year programs.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of top-drawer training are clear. ``If you're lucky
enough to go to a school like the CIA or the FCI, that almost
assures you some kind of higher entry-level position,'' said
Michael Batterberry, the founder of Food Arts magazine, a trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   But that assurance doesn't come cheap. Tuition and meals for the
two-year degree program at the Culinary Institute of America, for
instance, run $15,400 a year; students who stay on for a four-year
bachelor of professional studies degree pay $10,800 for each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   After four years, graduates can leave with loans totaling more
than $52,000, according to Andrea Harding, director of public
relations at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the graduates of top cooking schools have far more
hands-on experience in their field than a Harvard MBA does in, say,
closing an investment banking deal, the payoff on a degree hardly
compares.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Santiago, a recent graduate of the New England Culinary
Institute, has about $20,000 in loans to repay but makes just
$12.55 an hour as a garde-manger (or cold-appetizer station) cook
at Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the experience I'm getting in a restaurant of this
caliber, it's fine,'' said Ms. Santiago, 22, who returned to her
native Puerto Rico after graduation but came to New York for the
chance to work at the restaurant. ``You're here so many hours, it
all equals out. We get our meals here.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Cirque 2000 is hardly the most tight-fisted kitchen in fine
dining. It is unionized, and its pay scales are higher than those
in most independent restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Prep cooks, who cut vegetables, strain stocks and perform minor
cooking tasks, make $11.57 an hour; line cooks, who prepare dishes
for table service, make at least $12.55.
</P>
<P>
   One of those line cooks, Bridget Eagan, who works the pasta
station, takes home $496 a week for six long days of work. Ms.
Eagan, who is 21, considers that an acceptable salary for her first
job out of school. But her roommate _ who is several years older
and much more experienced _ earns less, as a line cook at Cafe
Boulud, an expensive new bistro owned by one of New York's star
chefs, Daniel Boulud. (Asked about the salaries at Cafe Boulud,
Alex Lee, the sous chef, said, ``I try to tell people who come here
that they're investing in their future.'')
</P>
<P>
   These days, the first few years out of cooking school can be
seen as a form of graduate school. In New York, the way you earn
your advanced degree determines your future. Those aspiring to be
four-star chefs try to get jobs in four-star restaurants like Le
Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They put in at a least a year, but almost never more than two,
covering as many stations in the kitchen as possible before moving
on to study with other master chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Camelo, a graduate of Johnson &AMP; Wales, has worked every station
at Le Cirque 2000 during the last year and a half, from the
garde-manger to the pasta and risotto station to the grill. He is
now what is called a tournant, which means he floats around the
kitchen, from noon to midnight, working wherever he is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks are competitive about stations, which in a kitchen this
large _ there are over 40 cooks _ are clearly defined. Garde-manger
is low on the ladder; a bit higher are the cooking stations for hot
appetizers and pasta and risotto. Highly coveted are the positions
at the fish, meat and grill lines, where the main courses are
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The cooks keep track of who is coming, who is going and where
they can make their next moves. Even Pedro Cabrera, 42, a prep cook
who has not gone to cooking school and does not speak English, is
positioning himself for promotion. He comes in early every day to
study with the fish butcher, so that he can take over that position
should the current butcher leave.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What is most important for these cooks, though, is to maintain a
good rapport with Khunn. That way, when their time in his kitchen
is up, he will help them get jobs at other top restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A cook needs to move around, Khunn explained in his thick
Cambodian accent: ``Like a designer, he needs to see the Calvin
Klein, the Prada, before he decides what style he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's restaurant world, as enormous as it may seem, is
actually quite cozy, chefs say. ``Chefs get together, and they talk
to each other,'' said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, founder of the French
Culinary Institute. ``They know when a cook is on the line and he's
ready for the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooks who stay in the city come into contact with one another
again and again. Networking is vital, and missteps can be costly.
If, for instance, a cook leaves a job before completing the time
the chef expected him to stay, word spreads quickly and he could
lose his ticket into other kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   In large cities across the United States, cooks spend a few
years traveling circuits similar to those in New York, trying to
move up the ladder as they hop from restaurant to restaurant. After
five to seven years at top restaurants, a cook can easily be poised
to open her own small restaurant, if she can find backers, or to be
hired as a sous chef _ the second in command _ at one of the top
spots, if she can sublimate her ego to the proprietor's.
</P>
<P>
   Some cooks, though, trade academic training, or the early years
of domestic networking, for tours abroad. ``I don't think there's
any experience that replaces going to Europe,'' Ms. Cann Hamilton
said. ``It shows curiosity and stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Traci Des Jardins, the chef and owner of
Jardiniere, a San Francisco restaurant known for its blend of
French and California cuisine, bypassed cooking school to
apprentice with Joachim Splichal of Seventh Street Bistro in Los
Angeles. Then she worked at several of Europe's gastronomic
temples, including Lucas Carton and Arpege in Paris and Louis XV in
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   After just eight months at these Michelin three-star
restaurants, she returned to the United States and was snapped up
by the Manhattan restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who hired her as the
sous chef at Montrachet, his three-star restaurant in Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   As a cook gets closer to setting out on his own, he must know
how to market himself. ``As with any art, there's the element of
luck _ meeting the right patrons who think your cooking is
terrific, and terrific enough to back it,'' Batterberry said. ``But
that's a little like discovering Lana Turner at the soda
fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to work in a place where you have visibility. Thomas
Keller, the chef at the celebrated French Laundry in California's
Napa Valley, for instance, established a following in Manhattan
with his inventive cuisine at Rakel. Vongerichten became known when
he was the chef at Lafayette, the restaurant in the Drake
Swissotel, where he helped revive the reputation of hotel
restaurant dining. When these men made the move to chef and owner,
both investors and faithful diners followed.
</P>
<P>
   Advancement to the level of executive chef is faster these days.
The emergence of the celebrity chef _ people like Wolfgang Puck and
Emeril Lagasse, with multiple restaurants, television shows and
book contracts _ has driven up the pace of ambition.
</P>
<P>
   So have the career changers increasingly entering the field,
drawn by the prospect of fame and familiar enough with success that
they are disinclined to pay their dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are leaving Wall Street; they're leaving law
professions,'' Ms. Cann Hamilton said. ``They're not going to want
to wait to get a decent salary.''
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs lament this new attitude. ``The kids, they go to
school and they are made to think they become chefs,'' Khunn said.
``But that is not the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pay scales have improved over the years, they remain much
like those for other artistic professions. ``For every rock singer
who makes a zillion dollars, there's a group that's barely able to
eke it out,'' Batterberry said. It is the same, he added, for
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the National Restaurant Association,
salaries for people with the title of executive chef _ the kitchen
CEOs _ averaged just $38,000 in 1995, and pay has not escalated
much since then.
</P>
<P>
   Other than salaries, probably the most eye-opening reality for
aspiring chefs is learning what an executive chef does. Much more
time is spent managing staff, controlling costs and schmoozing with
customers than on cooking, much less creating.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Cirque 2000, Khunn _ who generally works 12 to 16 hours a
day, seven days a week _ spends much of his day taking inventory
and ordering food so that there is enough to feed nearly 1,200
customers a day at lunches, dinners and banquets.
</P>
<P>
   He hires cooks, arranges schedules and, during mealtimes, darts
around the kitchen, keeping an eye on the line cooks' sauces,
advising the garde-manger about the thickness of the sliced
prosciutto, expediting orders and putting those silver dome lids
over finished dishes. But almost never does he stir, slice or
saute.
</P>
<P>
   In top restaurants, much of the cooking and creating is left to
the sous chef, sometimes called the chef de cuisine. ``If you want
the focus of what you're doing to be cooking, then get to be a sous
chef in a good kitchen,'' Ms. Des Jardins said. ``I really miss
that, coming in and being at the stoves all day.''
</P>
<P>
   But even getting to that level means years of hard physical
work, long hours and mind-numbing repetition. Cooking is an art,
but working proficiently in a professional kitchen is a craft.
Perhaps Ms. Cann Hamilton summed it up best: ``You make this
fantastic Jean Georges dish, but then you have to serve it 10,000
times.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that there is so much transience. Over two
recent weeks at Le Cirque 2000, the entire fabric of the kitchen
altered. One of the pasta cooks quit. Two cooks, one from Germany
and one from France, arrived to begin 18-month apprenticeships.
Camelo gave notice. (``I've been feeling trapped here a little,''
he explained.) And Andrew Carmellini, the sous chef, who had helped
Khunn get Le Cirque 2000 up and running, dropped a bomb by giving
notice, too; he had been hired away by Cafe Boulud.
</P>
<P>
   Khunn was scrambling. In addition to making an appearance at Le
Cirque 2000's new restaurant at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and
continuing to train his small army of New York cooks, who at
various moments during dinner service looked confused, he had to
search for a new sous chef.
</P>
<P>
   For this important hire, Khunn cannot place collegial calls to
other chefs. He has to headhunt, and it is likely that he will hire
someone away from another restaurant, much in the same way his
understudy was plucked away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Resumes, anyone?

 &HT;    William Schatten, 70, Emory professor, pianist, plastic surgeon
 &HT;    By Rachel Tobin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William E. Schatten, a concert pianist and world-renowned
Atlanta plastic surgeon, had gorgeous hands.
</P>
<P>
   The child prodigy pianist, who at age 18 played to packed houses
at the Fox Theatre with the Atlanta Pops Concert Orchestra in the
1940s, dreamed of being a professional pianist. An Emory University
medical student, noticing the piano soloist's beautiful hands at a
party, suggested he employ his hands as a plastic surgeon instead,
said his son, Kenneth Schatten of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville native pursued plastic surgery and
characteristically excelled. One of the youngest graduates of Emory
University Medical School at 21, he received clinical training at
Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio, and Barnes University
Hospital in St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of surgery at the National Institutes of Health in
Washington, Dr. Schatten earned an international reputation,
returning to Georgia in 1959 to become Atlanta's fifth plastic
surgeon, said Dr. Robert Crow of Atlanta, who practiced with Dr.
Schatten for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for Dr. Schatten, 70, who died Friday of cancer at
his residence, will be at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at Ahavath Achim
Synagogue. Green Lawn Jewish Funeral Directors is in charge of
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon also headed Brilund Ltd., a publicly traded Atlanta
company that owns mineral rights to 35 million acres in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Community service was practically a second career for Dr.
Schatten, who was a clinical assistant professor at Emory. In 1985
he received the Medical Association of Atlanta's highest honor, the
Aven Cup Award, for his community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Past president of the Atlanta Jewish Federation, Dr. Schatten
chaired the capital campaign for Epstein Day School, a 450-student
Jewish primary school, said Sanford Orkin of Atlanta, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   He spearheaded a major renovation of the Ahavath Achim Synagogue
as president in the 1970s, said Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of person who made things happen,'' said Rabbi
Goodman. ``He combined great intelligence with personal warmth and
charm. People followed him.'' He always honored his wife, Barbara
Cohen Schatten, as the person behind the scenes when he received
awards such as the Anti-Defamation League's Abe Goldstein Human
Relations Award in 1985, said his son, Dr. Sam Schatten, a
rheumatologist, of Atlanta. Lovers of music and education, Dr. and
Mrs. Schatten's legacy at Emory University includes the Schatten
Gallery in the Robert Woodruff Library, the Schatten Scholarship
for Judaic Studies and the I.T. Cohen Chair of International Law,
named for Mrs. Schatten's father.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Schatten wrote 64 medical articles and chapters for six
books. He invented a procedure called Schatten's Lateral Wedge
Technique used in breast reduction surgery and was a founding
member of the National Plastic Surgery Research Council. He was on
the board of trustees at West Paces Ferry Hospital 1981-87.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors other than his wife and sons include another son,
Gregory Schatten of New York; two daughters, Karen Shmerling of
Atlanta and Rona Nelson of New York; and 13 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family requested that contributions be
made to the Dr. William E. Schatten Achva Endowment Fund at the
Ahavath Achim Synagogue, 600 Peachtree Battle Ave., Atlanta, GA
30327.

<P>
   After a hard frost in the markets, an Indian summer of corporate
finance: With the Dow well back up in the 8,000s again, big deals
suddenly are as ubiquitous as pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clorox agreed to buy First Brands and Newell agreed
to merge with Rubbermaid (all consumer products makers), Kroger
made a deal to acquire Fred Meyer (grocery chains), Kaufman &AMP; Broad
Home agreed to buy Lewis Homes (home builders), and Deutsche Bank
was looking for a high-profile American investment bank to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco, the once-independent oil giant being spun off from
DuPont, raised a record $4.4 billion from enthusiastic investors
who hadn't seen a sizable initial public offering in more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   But not every deal basks in the warm sun: Wall Street couldn't
see the logic in the plan by McKesson, the nation's largest drug
wholesaler, to buy HBO &AMP; Co., a medical software company, and
hammered McKesson's stock. ... Proposed new accounting rules would
greatly restrict favorable ``pooling of interest'' treatment for
mergers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The continuing effects of cheap oil on the economy are being
thrown into sharp relief by the latest wave of earnings reports.
Nearly all the big airlines posted robust earnings last week
(Northwest, with its strike, and TWA, with its familiar host of
problems, were the exceptions), while nearly all the big oil
companies reported steeply falling profits.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the nation's per capita appetite for energy has
swollen back up to where it was before the oil shocks of the 1970s;
in real terms, today's oil prices are lower than 1973's. In spite
of cheaper oil imports, though, the nation's trade deficit has
widened sharply in recent months, largely because of weak demand
for American exports in recessionary Asia. &QL;

<P>
   The seven largest makers of heavy diesel engines, accused by the
Environmental Protection Agency of cheating on emissions tests for
a decade, settled the case by agreeing to pay a total of $1
billion, fix old engines as they are overhauled and design new
engines that meet tighter standards. Caterpillar and Cummins Engine
will pay the most in the settlement. ... Hunting for ways to keep
their ever-larger light trucks in compliance with federal emissions
and fuel economy standards, the Big Three auto makers are looking
at equipping them with more efficient diesel engines and have
quietly begun working with oil companies to develop a new synthetic
diesel-like fuel that they hope will burn as cleanly as gasoline.
... An obscure clause in the new federal spending law allows truck
and bus fleet operators to satisfy government requirements that
part of their fleets run on alternative energy sources by burning
``biodiesel'' fuel made with soy oil in ordinary engines, saving
the cost of buying new vehicles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   More proof that faulty risk management is a risk for management:
BankAmerica's president, David A. Coulter, resigned, two days after
word that the bank had lost a pile on a hedge-fund loan. ...
Goldman Sachs named 57 new partners, who will share in the spoils
when and if Goldman's postponed initial public offering is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's vice chairman, longest-serving partner and biggest
shareholder, Roy J. Zuckerberg, decided not to wait for the
offering before retiring, forgoing a possible payout of $200
million or more. ... The quarter's sour turn in the markets yielded
losses or disappointing earnings at Bankers Trust, Nomura
Securities and the newly merged Citigroup. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SO TO SPEAK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Is That All? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission is
requiring that stock and bond prospectuses and other disclosure
documents be written in plain English. To help their members master
so alien a tongue, the American Bar Association and the American
Society of Corporate Secretaries have sponsored workshops and
distributed a plain-language handbook from the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The tips and suggestions in the handbook are helpful, of course,
but the before-and-after examples are a revelation. Consider this
passage from a bond prospectus of Baltimore Gas and Electric, and
the handbook's suggested rewrite: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEFORE ``Each Note will bear interest from its date of issue at
the fixed rate per annum or at the rate per annum determined
pursuant to the interest rate formula, stated therein and in the
applicable Pricing Supplement, until the principal thereof is paid
or made available for payment.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTER ``The interest rate on the notes will either be fixed or
floating.'' &QL;

ROW 6 STARTERS GRAB ATTENTION IN PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY BOGGS 
C.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Pay no attention to the first 10 cars starting
tomorrow in the Dura Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The real race begins on Row 6.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Mark Martin and Jeff Gordon, fighting for the
NASCAR Winston Cup Championship, will start after yesterday's first
round of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Martin qualified 11th with a speed of 129.884 mph in the No. 6
Valvoline Ford Taurus and Gordon claimed the 12th spot with a
129.847-mph lap in the No. 24 DuPont Finishes Chevrolet Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has a 358-point lead over Martin with three races
remaining. He can clinch his second consecutive Cup title by
finishing 32nd or higher at Phoenix, Rockingham and Atlanta. Or he
can secure the title tomorrow by gaining 12 points on Martin in the
points chase.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gordon nor Martin was overly excited about his
qualifying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great race car, and it was all up to me to get a good
clean lap, and I over-drove it \Rinto Turn\S 1 and missed my line
big time,'' Gordon said. ``That is a sad lap. I'm disappointed in
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin: ``We never did quite get it like we wanted today
for qualifying, but we'll have a lot more time and a little bit
more leeway to work in once we start on hot tires and with the tape
off the front end.''
</P>
<P>
   Much happier was Ken Schrader, who won the pole with a
131.234-mph lap in the No. 33 Skoal Bandit Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win Sunday,'' said Schrader, who captured his 22nd
career pole and second this season. ``We worked a lot on our
flat-track program. We were excited about coming out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other not-quite-NASCAR stalwarts starting ahead of
Gordon and Martin are fifth-place Rich Bickle, who has one top-10
finish this season and is 39th in the standings; seventh-place Rick
Mast, who failed to qualify for the past two races; ninth-place
David Green, 45th in the standings after starting 12 of the
previous 30 races; and 10th-place Ted Musgrave, who earned his
first top-10 start at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Bickle said. ``This is the same car we took to
Richmond and didn't make the race. We bring it here, unload, and it
runs fast.''
</P>
<P>
   So you see why most of the attention is on Row 6. Besides, of
the 10 Cup races at Phoenix, seven have been won from outside the
top 10 and none from the pole.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of history that might give Martin hope is that Phoenix
is one of three speedways where Gordon has never won, joining Texas
Motor Speedway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Gordon, however, has
posted three top-five finishes (fourth in 1994 and fifth in '95 and
'96) here.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, won at Phoenix in 1993, finished second in
'92, '94 and 96 and has eight top-10 finishes. The question in his
camp is how his brand-new Taurus will handle the one-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't raced this car anywhere before,'' Martin said. ``We
took it to Atlanta in September for a Goodyear tire test, and it
had really good results in the wind tunnel. The team has not given
me a bad car all season, so I'm sure it will run great.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 25 qualifiers yesterday earned starting positions for
tomorrow's race. Among those failing to qualify were Corpus Christi
brothers Terry and Bobby Labonte and former Winston Cup champions
Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt. Second-round qualifying is
scheduled for today before the GM Goodwrench Service Plus/AC Delco
300 NASCAR Craftsman Truck race.

AFTER NINE DAYS OF TALKS, ACCORD ON MIDEAST IS SIGNED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nine days of tumultuous Mideast talks _ interrupted
by terrorism in Israel, disputes between Israelis and Palestinians,
and a last-minute spat between Israel and the United States _ wound
up &UR;  &LR; with an emotional White House ceremony Friday afternoon at
which a peace agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   The pact essentially recommits the two sides to the terms of the
Oslo Accords, signed five years ago, which never have been fully
implemented according to schedule. Under the new agreement, Israel
will withdraw troops from an additional 13.1 percent of the West
Bank over three months. Another 14.2 percent of land currently
under joint control will be transferred to sole Palestinian
control. In all, Palestinians will have joint or sole control over
about 40 percent of the West Bank if this interim agreement is
honored.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Palestinians are assured safe passage from the West Bank
to Gaza, and plans are to continue for the opening of an airport in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, which takes effect immediately, also calls for
increased US aid to Israelis and Palestinians, the release of
hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, and a role for
the CIA in supervising Palestinian authorities as they arrest
suspected terrorists, destroy terrorism networks, and seize illegal
arms. In exchange, Israel dropped its demands to extradite accused
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee will begin discussions on
a third Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank. Palestinians
had hoped for a more specific commitment.
</P>
<P>
   And next month, President Clinton plans to become the first US
president to visit the West Bank, where the Palestinian National
Council is scheduled to renounce those parts of its 34-year-old
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching a consensus took seven days of personal intervention by
Clinton, nine days and nights of involvement by Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and CIA director George Tenet, a visit by
Vice President Al Gore, and the exhortations of Jordan's ailing
King Hussein, who left chemotherapy treatments at the Mayo Clinic
in Minnesota to attend the last days of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around the world should be heartened by this
achievement today,'' Clinton said at the 90-minute ceremony Friday
afternoon in the East Room of the White House, where the historic
Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt was signed in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's voice was strained from several days of working past
midnight, and he had bags under his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians, the said, are ``closer to the day
when they can live peacefully, as true neighbors, with security,
prosperity, self-governance coopertion and eventually, God willing,
genuine friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   In unusually conciliatory speeches, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to work with his ``Palestinian
partners,'' saying, ``This is an important moment to give a secure
and peaceful future for our children and the children of our
neighbors, the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority, looked at
his one-time enemy and said, ``Your security is our security.'' He
added, ``We will not go back to violence and confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also pledged to quash terrorists ``so that no Israeli
mother will be worried if her son or daughter is late coming
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The two promised to meet soon to tackle the last and by far the
most contentious issues of the negotiations: the status of
Jerusalem, the allocation of water rights, and the creation of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The East Room was packed with members of the Israeli,
Palestinian, and US delegations to the talks, members of Congress,
and international journalists. Missing was Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who was campaigning for Democratic Senate candidate Carol
Moseley-Braun in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The White House event was a triumph for Clinton, who introduced
the leaders and spoke five different times. The ceremony was a far
different scene from Clinton's talks with Netanyahu and Arafat nine
months ago, when reporters peppered him with quesions about his
relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the tortuous process leading up to the ceremony
was easy, including deciding on the site for what were supposed to
be four days of talks. The negotiations lasted for another five
days, and the signing of the document was delayed by four and a
half hours because of a fight between Clinton and Netanyahu over
the release of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wrapped up a 21-hour negotiating marathon at Maryland's
Eastern Shore when exhausted aides announced at 7 a.m. Friday that
a land-for-peace deal had finally been reached. But shortly after,
officials said, Netanyahu pressed for details about the release of
Pollard, a Navy intelligence analyst who was sentenced to life in
prison in 1987 for giving Israel a vast amount of highly-classified
military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   US officials were caught off-guard. With Clinton's Marine One
helicopter ready to depart for the White House ceremony and
Netanyahu's work deadline for the Jewish Sabbath fast approaching,
Clinton and Netanyahu had a heated exchange, according to Israeli
television. Administration officials gave a tamer account of the
disagreement, saying the two leaders huddled for several tense
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who had hoped to bring Pollard back to Israel in his
plane, relented and the signing was hastily rescheduled. At the
ceremony, Clinton said he would review Pollard's appeal but could
not promise to do anything more.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the unexpected snags and conflicts, Clinton spoke of
his 77 hours at Wye Plantation, ``every one of which I treasured,
some more than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was tinged with sadness because of the appearance
of the senior statesman of the Mideast, King Hussein, who is in
poor health. ``My morale is as high as it has ever been,'' the
monarch said. ``This has been a shot in the arm for me, Mr. Arafat
and Mr. Netanyahu.'' He added, ``There has been enough destruction,
enough death, enough waste.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, Netanyahu and Arafat _ once bitter enemies
_ shook hands at three different times although they rarely smiled
at each other. Both looked exhausted from days of talks that
usually lasted well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   On another somber note, Clinton warned that both Netanyahu and
Arafat will face death threats from their own people who dislike
the peace deal. Clinton repeatedly saluted the courage of the two
leaders and warned that the Middle East will probably not be free
of terrorist attacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed on a table brought to the White House
Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Clinton noted that the United States and
Spain had signed a peace treaty on the table 100 years ago, and
President Kennedy signed the nuclear test ban treaty on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Albright termed this agreement, delayed by 19 months over
Israeli and Palestinian differences, ``a confidence-building
measure'' _ ``not a conclusion, but a new chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was careful not to call the document a peace
treaty. Instead, it was billed as an interim agreement named the
``Wye River Memorandum.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks marked an extraordinary level of commitment of Clinton
and his national security team. After refusing for days to comment
on the involvement of Tenet, the State Department finally
acknowledged on Thursday that the CIA chief was mediating thorny
security talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton saluted Tenet, who attended the East Room ceremony, for
his ``unusual, almost unprecedented role'' in the talks at the Wye
River estate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA will play a key role in the implementation of the peace
process by vetting Israeli requests for arrests of suspects and
coordinating collections of illegal weapons in the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes another unusual wrinkle: Clinton will
travel to the West Bank in a few weeks to witness the Palestine
National Council repudiate the 1964 charter that calls for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat claims that about 30 anti-Israel sections of the charter
have already been anulled in closed meetings, but Netanyahu
insisted that they be removed in public.
</P>
<P>
   US officials had expressed exasperation Wednesday night when
Netanyahu ordered his staff to pack their suitcases, charging that
Arafat was retreating from his promises to crack down on terrorist
acativities aimed at Israel. But by Friday afternoon, the hurt
feelings had been soothed.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Netanyahu, Clinton said, ``I was once again
extraordinarily impresed by the energy, the drive, the
determination, the will, the complete grasp of every detailed
aspect of every issue that this prime minister brought to these
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu returned the praise. Looking at Clinton, he said, ``He
is, if I can borrow a cliche, a warrior for peace. I mean he
doesn't stop. He has this ability to maintain a tierless pace and
to nudge and prod.''

 &HT;    No. 6 FSU battles against Yellow Jackets for ACC lead
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the 1992 loss to Florida State started a downward
spiral for Georgia Tech football, then what could a win over the
No. 6 Seminoles in tonight's nationally televised game at Bobby
Dodd Stadium mean for the No. 20 Yellow Jackets?
</P>
<P>
   Let senior defensive end Jesse Tarplin count the ways.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The most important thing is the ACC,'' he said. ``If we win
the game, we should be in the driver's seat of the ACC (title
race).''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Just to beat Florida State, for a change,'' said Tarplin,
who has played in three of Tech's six consecutive losses to the
Seminoles. ``I've never beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It'll push us over the top (as a program), right where you
want to be,'' he said. ``It'll help recruiting if we win, bring
some talented athletes in, help us keep up with athletes we haven't
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``People might start recognizing us a little more, that this
team is for real,'' Tarplin said. ``That would also be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would a loss mean?
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets' five-game winning streak, including
victories over ranked N.C. State and Virginia, is too much to be
rendered meaningless. But if Tech loses to Florida State as it has
for the last six years, it will spoil the Jackets' hopes for taking
the program to the next level.The Yellow Jackets might be the ones
in first place in the ACC with an unbeaten conference record, but
until they win, they will be underdogs to the Garnet and Gold. This
week's betting line proves that _ Florida State is favored by 12
1/2 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out and prove we're on the same level as FSU,''
Tech receiver Dez White said. ``We've been embarrassed, basically,
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   When N.C. State upset the Seminoles 24-7 on Sept. 12, other
teams could argue that the ACC finally was narrowing the gap
between Florida State and everybody else. But after the Seminoles
won convincingly over Miami and Clemson, and with Florida State
approaching this game as a must win for a seventh consecutive ACC
title, the task for Tech is that much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more talent on their team than we do,'' defensive
end Nate Stimson said. ``If I didn't say that, I'd be lying. Their
two-deep could start pretty much anywhere. I don't know if that
will be the difference, though.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of sentiment helped the Yellow Jackets past an
arguably more talented Virginia team, and it's what might separate
this team from the last few at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got guys on the field trying not to lose, you're in
trouble,'' Tarplin said. ``I think that's been the difference
between this year and the last few years. We have a whole lot of
people that believe we can play in this game, the whole team. Last
year, I don't know if everyone was believing in that. This year, it
will be a different atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin was a high school sophomore in 1992 when, trailing Tech
21-7 in the fourth quarter, FSU quarterback Charlie Ward led the
Seminoles to a 29-24 victory.Since 1992 Tech has lost to the
Seminoles 51-0, 41-10, 42-10, 49-3 and 38-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten better each year we've played them,'' Tarplin
said. ``My freshmen year we played them for a quarter. Sophomore
year, for a half. Last year, we played them for three quarters.
Now, we just ought to try playing them a full game and see if we
come out with a win.

 &HT;    A second flooding fails to drive family away from the river
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Sunday morning, when the roads were open
again, when they finally could get to their home, Bob Watson told
his wife as they were driving into town: ``I hope everything is
gone. I hope it's
</P>
<P>
   gone clean down to the slab, so we don't have to go through that
cleanup again.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't gone. And they are, he at age 60, she at 59, once
again faced with what seems an almost insurmountable task of
cleaning up after a devastating flood.
</P>
<P>
   Their house, the one they built in 1967 at 78 Guada Coma, on a
hill above what she ironically calls ``the calm Comal,'' looks on
the inside as if it had stood abandoned for half a century. Look up
and there is no ceiling; just bare rafters straight up to the roof.
Look at the walls, and there are gaping holes in the Sheetrock,
gashes and strips of filthy, muddy Sheetrock hanging down. From
what was the ceiling, fans and light fixtures dangle from their
wires at waist level, even knee level. And everywhere on the floor,
from baseboard to baseboard, is an inches-thick layer of gray-black
muck, some mud and mostly still-soggy, squishy insulation. It
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Watsons and their daughter Juliet, 31, sit on the
slab of the guest house, where Juliet lived, and on the steel
I-beams that held it 12 feet above the ground. The guest house is
somewhere down the river. Ask Bob Watson what he had planned to be
doing this week, how he had thought he would use the retirement he
began in May after 36 years as a teacher here, and he smiles. ``I
had planned to do some work on the house,'' he says. ``Just not
this much.''
</P>
<P>
   They had all been at Canyon Lake on Saturday when the rains
started cascading off the cliffs there. By telephone, a neighbor
told them the water at their home was rising, and when the roads
into town were closed, they knew what they were going to see. They
had seen it in 1972, when floodwaters reached almost to the top of
the two-story cedar-sided house. This time, water was over the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   In '72, Bob and his wife Laneta _ now also retired after 31
years of teaching _ were at a theater performance, and the two
girls were home with the baby sitter. That flood came at night, and
Bob was in the boat that rescued the children from the second-floor
balcony. Even that first time, Laneta says, the only tears she shed
were of joy at seeing her daughters safe.
</P>
<P>
   They rebuilt on the same spot. ``We did give some thought to
moving,'' says Laneta, ``but our two girls said, `This is home; we
don't want to leave.' And if they weren't afraid to come back, who
were we to take them away?''
</P>
<P>
   If it was the children who were decisive in rebuilding in '72,
it is the older daughter, Caroline, who is the reference point for
enduring this time. She died in May, a year ago, of a brain tumor.
Says Juliet: ``This is so small, compared to losing my sister. We
can't buy her back. We can buy back a house. Maybe it won't be as
nice . . . but it can all be replaced. It can all be replaced
except for the lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline's husband and three children live in Venezuela, and the
Watsons had planned to see them there next week. That is on hold
until they can begin sorting out their lives once again. But Bob
makes a joke. ``We have had every shot known to God and man. We can
get out and work in this muck and not worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What they do worry about is the cats. There were five. The two
outdoor cats, Woody and Leon, are safe. Of the three indoor cats,
there has been no trace. Juliet has found, a couple of miles
downriver, bits of the stained glass that flanked the door of her
house, some strips of her wallpaper. But she was really looking for
the cats. There's a black one, a white one, and one that looks like
he's been dusted all over with orange. ``If she could find those,''
says Bob, ``we would all be happy people.'' They take some heart
from neighbor Ann Green, whose cat was lost in the '72 flood and
found a month later, on the other side of the river, sick and
emaciated but alive. It lived 14 more years, she says.
</P>
<P>
   From the Watsons' house on a hill next to the Comal, the street
slopes downward. There were homes on the upriver side, half a dozen
of them, no longer there. They got Bob Watson's wish for a clean
start.
</P>
<P>
   One of those homes, part of it, is a mountain of wood and metal
and wiring and trash piled up against a towering elm in the
Watson's front yard. Another took out the house on steel stilts
where Juliet lived. A neighbor told her, she says. ``I think it was
the Rockwoods' house that came down and hit my house and cut it off
like a razor blade. We called it the treehouse. My dad always
promised me a treehouse, and he built it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain didn't stop until Thursday, but the Watsons had begun
cleaning out what they could days earlier. Their neighbor Ann Lee
told Bob she'd watched him Tuesday as he washed household items in
a big puddle in front of the house and ``You looked positively
cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things are the same as in '72. The house, Bob says, looks
about like it did then. As then, they were able to save the
treasured family photos intact. As then, friends, neighbors and
family have come to help, to haul off to safe places that which can
be saved, to take sodden clothing and filthy dishes and wash them.
``But they told us,'' Bob jokes, ``this is the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first flood, it was a year before they could move back
in and they think it will be about the same this time. They're
staying with Laneta's mother, but hope to move into federally
subsidized housing, as they did before, when the paperwork can be
done. Bob has already talked to someone with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. It will be a couple of weeks before inspectors
can be here to see if they qualify. Still, it's not going to be
easy. They're both living on teacher retirement. They had some
flood insurance, enough to cover about a third of their costs, they
think. The federal loan they got in '72 took 20 years to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are different. This time, their yard is full of
steel beams and huge piles of heavy debris that they can't remove
themselves and don't yet know who can. This time, the foundation
may be cracked, but they don't know that yet. And this time, the
house may be so heavily damaged that they'll have to pull it down
before they can start over. But they will start over and right here
at 78 Guada Coma. ``Just look,'' says Bob, by way of explanation,
holding one arm up to the tall trees and now-blue sky beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had such good times here,'' says Laneta. ``I remember
one day a teacher I worked with came home with me and said, 'I
don't know how you get up and go to school every day; I just don't
think I could leave this.' I guess we keep tempting this river,
because we haven't lost anyone to it. But it's such a beautiful
river.''

 &HT;    Yogi museum ain't open till it's open
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALL, N.J. _ Let the rest of the metropolitan New York
baseball world assemble in lower Manhattan. For a change, Yankee
fans threw confetti Friday instead of beer, batteries and
invective. Big deal. What's a World Series ticker-tape parade when
compared to the cultural event of the year. The Van Gogh exhibit in
D.C.? Monet in Boston? Nah. The dedication of the Yogi Berra
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot,'' said the Hall of Fame Yankee catcher.
``When you have places like this, you're usually dead or gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi was very much alive and kicking off Friday's ceremony on
the campus of Montclair State University, near his home. The Yogi
Museum won't officially open for a couple of weeks. So technically,
it ain't open till it's open.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday afternoon, shortly after the Yankees savored
their second world championship in three years by parading through
the _ ahem _ Canyon of Champions, the House that Yogi's Friends
Built opened. It features wonderful and rare Yogi memorabilia and
minutiae ranging from the bronzed catcher's mitt he used to catch
Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series to the syntax he
fractured with astounding regularity.
</P>
<P>
   And again Friday. ``They got photos here,'' Berra said, ``I
didn't even know I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos of a young, T-shirted Yogi back home on The Hill in St.
Louis. Of Yogi wearing 3-D glasses and reading acomic book. And, of
course, Yogi plugging ``The Drink of Champions.'' Yoo-Hoo, his
chocolate-flavored drink of choice (''Me-hee for Yoo-Hoo, fudge
bars, too-hoo!'').
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries included Ted Williams; Whitey Ford; Gil McDougald;
Larry Doby, and Ralph Branca. But the focus was Yogi, long
estranged from the Yankees because of his contempt for Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner. For years, Berra has avoided Yankee Stadium
due to Steinbrenner. As for returning to Yankee Stadium, ``I'm
thinking about it,'' Berra said. ``Everybody wants me to do it.
Maybe next year.

INVESTIGATIONS OF TRIPP TAPES ARE ADVANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parallel investigations of the recordings made by
Linda Tripp of her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky
have moved forward in recent days with the issuance of new
subpoenas and the questioning of important witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is examining whether
Mrs. Tripp or anyone else may have altered or duplicated the tapes.
Maryland authorities have convened a grand jury to examine whether
Mrs. Tripp broke a state law when she made the recordings without
Ms. Lewinsky's consent.
</P>
<P>
   While the tapes were considered significant evidence in the
early days of the inquiry, their role diminished significantly in
the impeachment case against the president once Ms. Lewinsky agreed
to testify and turn over other evidence about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats have signaled that the legality of the tapes
and any alterations to them could surface as issues if the House
decides to hold impeachment hearings after next month's
congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigators spent three hours on Friday questioning
Lucianne Goldberg, the New York book agent who urged Mrs. Tripp to
make the tapes. On Wednesday they questioned Mrs. Tripp for two
hours. At least seven of the tapes appear to be duplications,
according to inquiry records that Starr handed over to Congress
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after she spoke with the investigators, Ms.
Goldberg said she made no copies or alterations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it and Linda didn't do it, that's all I know,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp had told the grand jurors that she made no
duplications, a position that she repeated to investigators this
week, a lawyer for Mrs. Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said Mrs. Tripp was continuing
to cooperate with the Starr inquiry but that cooperation would end
if Starr indicated that she was to become the target of his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland inquiry, meanwhile, another lawyer for Mrs.
Tripp, Joe Murtha, received a subpoena from the grand jury seeking
any original tapes or copies that contained Ms. Lewinsky's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're outraged,'' Zaccagnini said. ``We view this as an
evasive violation of the attorney-client privilege and part of the
effort to intimidate Mrs. Tripp and her lawyers. We will not back
down. We will fight the subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaccagnini would not say whether Murtha or any of the lawyers
had any of the tapes that prosecutors were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are asking witnesses for tapes because an immunity
agreement between Mrs. Tripp and Starr prohibits the Maryland
authorities from using the tapes that Mrs. Tripp turned over to the
independent counsel. Lawyers involved in the Lewinsky inquiry have
maintained that Mrs. Tripp decided to turn to the independent
counsel last January largely to get immunity from a possible state
prosecution. At the time, she had been told by an earlier lawyer
representing her that making the tapes could be a violation of
Maryland law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the immunity deal is not all-encompassing, and Maryland
authorities have been working since last July to see if they can
make a case against Mrs. Tripp without the tapes that she turned
over to Starr. A local grand jury has already heard from a salesman
at the Radio Shack that sold Mrs. Tripp the tape-recorder she used
and a lawyer involved in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. It
was in that lawsuit that the independent counsel contends the
president lied about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Among those scheduled to testify next month in the state case
are Ms. Goldberg and her son, Jonah. Ms. Lewinsky is not expected
to make a grand jury appearance in Maryland but may provide
information for the inquiry either through a deposition or an
affidavit, lawyers involved in the inquiry said.

 &HT;    This Tech team won't follow in footsteps of 1990 champs
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The score was the same: 41-38. The response was the
same: The goalposts off North Avenue came down. What happens next
will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech will not win the national championship this time,
and not just because it has one loss as opposed to one tie in 1990.
This is a good team. The '90 Jackets bordered on great. That team
had a providential schedule. This one does not. Once past Virginia,
that team had it all downhill. This climb gets steeper.
</P>
<P>
   That team played defense first. Remember Willie Clay, Marco
Coleman, Coleman Rudolph, Ken Swilling, Calvin Tiggle, Jerrelle
Williams? Remember the second half of the Clemson game, in which
the Tigers ran 58 plays to Tech's 18 but the Jackets fended them
off? (Chris Gardocki's 60-yard field goal landed short at the end,
same as Todd Braverman's 54-yarder last week.) The '90 Jackets
yielded 12 touchdowns in the regular season. Virginia got nearly
half that many last week.
</P>
<P>
   You can say the game has changed in the intervening years, that
everybody throws and scores more now, and you'd be partly right.
But only partly. Then as now, a team saddled with a bad defense is
a team, if not quite living a lie, then at least nursing a major
fib. Tech leads the ACC at 4-0 yet lags the league in total
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Question: In the history of football, has another team gained
600 yards in a game and lost? (I don't know. I'm asking.) You can
say that Tech ultimately stopped Virginia when it mattered, that
the Jackets' capacity for scoring via D offsets the crush of
yardage. You can say it, but you'd be subscribing to a new sort of
philosophy. Bend-but-don't-break? This is wilt-but-don't-lose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Tech's defense offered an underpinning. Those Jackets
were capable of beating Virginia Tech 6-3 a week after the
Armageddon in Charlottesville. This team must score and keep
scoring and hope the other guy gets winded. This team will happen
upon opponents that can keep the game in the 20s. Fun fact: The one
time Tech didn't score 40 points this season, it lost.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hamilton might well be a better quarterback than Shawn
Jones, which is saying something. (Over the last two months of the
'90 season, Jones was the best player in the land.) Jones, though,
had help. An immense line cleared space for the powerful William
Bell. The '90 Jackets got ahead by throwing and stayed there by
pounding, pounding, pounding. This team is all speed and guile.
This team is more dependent on Hamilton than the Falcons are on
Chris Chandler, which is also saying something.
</P>
<P>
   After Virginia, the 1990 Jackets didn't play another ranked team
until getting No. 19 Nebraska in the Citrus Bowl. Georgia was down
that year, bound for 4-7. Florida State was an independent. Eight
years ago, there was a yearly struggle to win the ACC. Since FSU
joined in '92, everybody has played for second place. Georgia Tech
could essentially take the crown by winning tonight, but this game
seems a bridge too far. The '90 Jackets went into every test
knowing theirs would be the stronger defense. Their '98
counterparts haven't been able to say that yet.

 &HT;    Ex-Jet Mathis knows of N.Y. fans' intensity
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wide receiver Terance Mathis is a native of Stone
Mountain and loves playing for the Falcons, but that doesn't mean
he was happy to leave New York in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets drafted him in the sixth round in 1990, after drafting
RB Blair Thomas, WR Reggie Rembert, CB Tony Stargell, QB Troy
Taylor, DT Tony Savage, and CB Robert McWright.
</P>
<P>
   Under coach Bruce Coslet, he played four seasons, mostly behind
Al Toon, Rob Moore, and Chris Burkett, catching 93 passes for 1,242
yards and four TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing with the Falcons as an unrestricted free agent in
May 1994, he has caught 343 passes for 4,347 yards and 37 TDs and
is climbing fast on the lists in the team record book.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mathis said Sunday's road game against the Jets isn't
a big deal. The more he talked with the Journal-Constitution, the
more the truth emerged.
</P>
<P>
   AJC Is this game any more important to you than others?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: Not anymore. If you had caught me a few years ago, maybe
so. But I've been away so long.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What can you tell your teammates about playing up there?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: If you think Giants fans were tough (two weeks ago), you
won't believe Jets fans. It's loud. Jets fans are more into it.
When we played the Giants, going to the stadium, there were
butterflies. I forgot how the New York fans took on football, but
when I saw the tailgate parties I was like, ``Whoa! I remember
this.''
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Where did you live up there, and what do you miss?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: I lived on Long Island (near the Jets' practice
facility). Oh, I miss the delis. Every morning, I used to stop and
get a breakfast sandwich. You could always get a nice sandwich. I
miss the city. Flying in at night, all the lights and tall
buildings _ it's awesome. It will take your breath away. I miss
people in the organization, in the ticket office, media relations.
I was a kid. They took me under their wing.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Are you sure this game won't be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: I say this game is not important, but it is. I want to
see the reaction I get from fans, the organization, the media. You
never want to be forgotten. I know _ this time, instead of
butterflies, I'll have pigeons, and sea gulls. I just got to stay
on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You've said this team could not win without Chris Chandler
at QB. What (do you say) now that Steve DeBerg looks almost certain
to start?
</P>
<P>
   Mathis: That was an effort to let Chris know we need him. But we
have the confidence in ourselves now that we can go out and get the
job done without him. We'd love to see Chris in there, but it looks
like he might not be, so we can win with Steve DeBerg. Before, we
felt like no matter where the ball was, we could move downfield and
score. Now, field position, taking care of the ball, not giving up
big plays, making big plays _ all those things are more important.

 &HT;    Falcons say DeBerg nearly certain to start
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler practiced
for the second day in a row, but coach Dan Reeves said Chandler
remains doubtful for Sunday's road game against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Backups Steve DeBerg and Tony Graziani took all the snaps with
the first and second offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the final decision will be made 90 minutes before
the game, but it's nearly certain DeBerg will start, becoming at
age 44 the oldest player to start an NFL game at any position.
Chandler probably will be the No. 3, or emergency quarterback. That
would mean that if he entered the game any time before the fourth
quarter, neither DeBerg nor Graziani could play again.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, but doubtful, that Chandler could be the No.
2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chandler) was better; he's made some progress,'' Reeves said.
``Again, though, I would say he's doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, DT Travis Hall practiced for the first time this week
with a sprained ankle and especially sore bruised knee, and
although Reeves said Hall remains doubtful, chances are very good
he'll play. How much is uncertain, however.
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' four early inactive players are LB Henri Crockett
(dislocated wrist), RB Harold Green (for the fifth-straight game),
C/G Dave Widell (fifth-straight) and S Omar Brown
(seventh-straight). Don't be surprised to see all six Falcon CBs
active tomorrow, as the strained hamstring of reserve Randy Fuller
(questionable) and strained abdomen and back muscle of starter
Ronnie Bradford are troubling coaches as well as the players.
</P>
<P>
   Key matchup
</P>
<P>
   Starting CB Ray Buchanan (5-feet-9, 195 pounds) is likely to
shadow Jets WR Keyshawn Johnson (6-foot-3, 212), and Buchanan will
have to find ways to compensate for his height disadvantage.
``Keyshawn is not a great route runner,'' Buchanan said. ``He's a
big-play guy, who gets downfield and can jump and use his height
and ability. The main thing for him is disrupting his timing so
(Jets QB) Vinny (Testaverde) can't hurt you. It's going to be more
the great throws Vinny makes (rather than a great route by
Johnson).''
</P>
<P>
   History lesson
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons win, it will be the first 6-1 start in team
history. The other time they were 5-1, in 1986, they finished the
schedule 2-7-1, leading to the exit of head coach Dan Henning, now
the Jets' QB coach. After the 5-1 start that year, the Falcons tied
the 49ers at home, then lost five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have joined the list of teams using zone blitzes,
sprinkling a few in during last week's game against New Orleans.
Look for a few different versions today against the Jets. Against
the Saints, DT Shane Dronett dropped into short pass coverage,
while a blitzing linebacker took his spot in the pass rush. ...
Don't be shocked to see right DE Chuck Smith and left DE Lester
Archambeau switch sides; same thing with right DT Dronett and
whoever plays left DT. The Falcons look for the occasional
mismatch, especially with Smith, their best pure pass rusher. ...
Jamal Anderson is apt to line up wide once in a while, as the
Falcons try to take a potential blitzer outside with him.
</P>
<P>
   Jammin' Jamal
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will go for a franchise-record fifth-straight game of
100 or more yards. Gerald Riggs hit the century mark four times in
a row in 1985. Anderson, a seventh-round draft choice in 1994, and
the 24th RB selected that year, now has more combined rushing and
receiving yards (3,792) than any other RB drafted that year except
first-rounder Marshall Faulk of the Colts (6,833). Anderson's
numbers rank him ahead of such players from the '94 draft as Bam
Morris, Dorsey Levens, Errict Rhett, Raymont Harris, Greg Hill,
Mario Bates, Charlie Garner and William Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Former Falcon T Bill Fralic (1985-92) will be inducted into the
College Football Hall of Fame on Dec. 8, in South Bend, Ind. He
played at the University of Pittsburgh. ... WGST's radio broadcast
will be carried live over the Armed Forces Network around the
globe. ... Jets coach Bill Parcells got his first victory against
the Falcons, 16-13, in Atlanta on Sept. 11, 1983. He was coaching
the Giants. He's 4-0 lifetime against Reeves, including a 39-20 win
in Super Bowl XXV when he coached the Giants and Reeves the
Broncos. ... Jets DE Anthony Pleasant played in 11 games for the
Falcons last year. ... New York S Victor Green is from Americus.
... Jets TE Kyle Brady, a former first-round pick, has at times
been labeled a disappointment, and he entered this season with a
modest 63 catches and five TDs in three seasons. But the 6-foot-6,
268-pounder already has 12 catches and three TDs this season,
including two TDs in Monday night's 24-14 win at New England.

 &HT;    Marlin takes scenic route to Phoenix, pays for it
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sterling Marlin's journey from Mooresville, N.C. to
Phoenix was like a relay down I-10 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It started when he decided to ride in the team's hauler with
driver Jerry Schweitz, just for a change of pace, before the truck
broke down just inside the Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin was walking to a truck he and Schweitz had flagged by CB
radio when a woman apparently in her 80s agreed to take Marlin from
the downed truck to the waiting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, I was just going to the truck up the road, but she
said she would carry me up there,'' Marlin said. ``I opened the
back door, threw my stuff in the back seat, and she had Bing Crosby
playing wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   The trucker took Marlin to a Tucson truck stop, where quite by
accident he ran into Rusty Wallace tire changer Bill Wilburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really lucky because another five minutes or so, I
would've missed him,'' Marlin said. ``He had just pulled into the
truck stop to get some gas. This is the first time I've ridden in
the truck to a race since 1983. We all thought it'd be a scenic
ride out to the race. I might want to fly back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin arrived in Phoenix early enough to make his night
autograph signing session.
</P>
<P>
   Busch on the way
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Busch Grand National circuit makes its Phoenix debut
here Nov. 6, 1999 in conjunction with the Winston Cup Dura-Lube
500. No title sponsor has been named.
</P>
<P>
   Truckin'
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Craftsman Truck point title remains up for grabs. The
1997 champion Jack Sprague leads Ron Hornaday by 38 points going
into today's Goodwrench 300. Sprague starts second today behind
pole winner Mike Bliss. Hornaday goes fifth. Winston Cup rookie
driver Kenny Irvan, a two-time winner in '97, will start 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The pole is Bliss' fourth of the season.

TOUGHER AUDITS URGED FOR ASIAN COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After putting their stamp of approval on the financial
statements of Asian financial institutions that then collapsed, the
world's five largest accounting firms are coming under increasing
pressure to strengthen their auditing procedures in Asian and other
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Five, which audit almost all major corporations in the
United States, also audited most of the big Asian banks that failed
last year, according to a new study by the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development. Investors and lenders had been given a false sense
of assurance that the banks were strong, the study said, when they
saw the accounting firms' names on the audited financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The study, an early draft of which was obtained by The New York
Times, concluded that the Asian crisis would have been detected
sooner if the banks and companies had been forced to follow
stronger accounting rules than those now in use in most Asian
countries. The study urged the Big Five firms to do the same strong
auditing tests on financial statements in Asia that they do in the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is also pressing the accounting firms to do more
to get Asian banks and companies to use better accounting. The
lending agency wants the accountants to ask the companies they
audit to follow international standards, which are stronger than
the rules now followed in Thailand, Indonesia, China and other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies refuse, the World Bank wants the accounting
firms to not sign the financial statements with their world-famous
names _ PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &AMP; Young, KPMG, Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu and Arthur AndersenAndersen Worldwide. In many
Asian countries, the global accounting firms have gained a presence
by taking over local firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major expectation gap when they put their global
names on accounts that don't meet international standards,'' said
Jules W. Muis, the World Bank's vice president and comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Muis said the big accounting firms ``have been in the
forefront'' of an international effort to get Asian governments to
adopt stronger accounting rules. ``But at the moment,'' he said,
``it's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Five say they must follow the accounting and auditing
rules that are now in place in every country. And, they say that
they are doing what they can to move countries toward using a
single set of global rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like electrical outlets are different in every country,
so are the accounting rules,'' said Robert A. Campbell, regional
managing partner for the Asia-Pacific region at Deloitte Touche
Tomatsu. ``The Big Five are eager to apply consistent standards
around the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accounting firms and the World Bank are both helping a group
known as the International Accounting Standards Committee complete
its work on a set of global rules. The group hopes that most
countries will adopt the international rules so that investors can
easily compare companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the international rules are weaker and less detailed than
the accounting standards in place in the United States, so it is
doubtful that Washington regulators would allow companies following
the international rules to trade their shares on exchanges in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Muis said it would be difficult to get other countries to adopt
the more detailed American accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing those at the world would probably be
counterproductive,'' he said, ``because the world would not
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations study, which will be released early in
November, reviewed the financial statements of the largest
companies and banks in South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In its preliminary conclusions, the study said that poor
accounting did not directly cause the Asian financial crisis that
began in the summer of 1997. But it said that the Asian companies'
financial difficulties would have been detected sooner, and the
crisis would have been less severe, if the accounting methods used
by the companies and their auditors had been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The study also laid part of the blame for the crisis on
international money managers, financial analysts and credit-rating
agencies. Savvy international investors continued to pour money
into East Asia, the study said, even when they knew that the
companies followed weak accounting rules and could easily hide
their financial problems.

Unlike the advent of long-distance telephone competition, there is
little savings for the average consumer in the deregulation of gas

CIA MISHANDLED DATA ON RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN HONDURAS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, while the U.S. government was pouring
millions of dollars of military aid into Honduras, the Honduran
armed forces committed hundreds of human rights violations against
its own citizens, the CIA has found.
</P>
<P>
   According to a newly declassified report, internal
investigations by the agency found that although CIA officers in
Honduras knew that the military operated a right-wing assassination
squad, the officers' poor reporting on human rights problems left
senior CIA officials unaware of their seriousness and scope.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA also sometimes gave misleading information to Congress,
the 1997 report indicated, downplaying Honduran involvement in
abuses at least in part so as not to jeopardize the country's
crucial support for rebels fighting against the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``CIA reporting to Congress in the early 1980s underestimated
Honduran involvement in abuses,'' the report states. ``By the
mid-1980s, CIA provided more detailed information to Congress, but
some of the notifications were inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   A redacted copy of the 211-page report of the inspector general
was released to the human rights commissioner of Honduras, Leo
Valladares, and was made public by the National Security Archive, a
nonprofit research group in Washington. The document was heavily
censored by the agency, with large sections blacked out entirely
for reasons that are not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the report indicates that the CIA had specific
knowledge of serious and widespread abuses at a time when it
suggested to Congress that the transgressions of the Honduran
military were being exaggerated by its ideological foes.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday night, the CIA's former station
chief in Honduras during part of the period covered by the report
continued to dispute that U.S. intelligence officers there had
information about widespread abuses by the Honduran security forces
or failed to report what they learned on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Honduran military was a very benign kind of military,''
said the former official, Donald Winters, who headed the CIA's
operation in Honduras between 1982 and 1984. ``It was not
repressive. It did not murder. It did not torture.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA officers, he said, reported on the problem ``to the fullest
of our knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's internal inquiries into the matter began in response
to a series of articles published in 1995 by The Baltimore Sun. The
articles asserted that the CIA trained and supported the Honduran
military despite reports that a secret army intelligence unit was
kidnapping, torturing and murdering hundreds of suspected leftists.
</P>
<P>
   A first CIA investigation in 1995 and 1996 by a committee
appointed by the then-director of Central Intelligence, John
Deutch, found no information to show that CIA officers ``authorized
or were directly involved in human rights abuses.'' Nor could it
corroborate reports cited in the newspaper that a CIA employee was
present during the torture by army intelligence officers of a
Honduran woman thought to have been a guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the inspector general's assessment was more narrow,
dealing with a handful of questions left unresolved in the first
inquiry. Both investigations dealt largely with events that took
place in Central America between 1980 and 1984, the period in which
the Reagan administration used the CIA to establish bases in
Honduras for the Nicaraguan rebels who were known as
counterrevolutionaries, or Contras.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the CIA's station in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, served as a command center for the Nicaraguan war and grew
to be the agency's largest anywhere in the world. Officials who
served in the American Embassy there at the time said that for both
Winters and other station chiefs, and for U.S. Ambassador John
Negroponte, the overriding priority was to insure that the Honduran
government and its powerful, often independent military hierarchy
continued to support that war effort.
</P>
<P>
   According to a CIA cable in 1995 that was also made public
Friday, the intelligence branch of Honduras' paramilitary security
forces maintained a secret unit between 1980 and 1984 that was
known as the Honduran Anti-Communist Liberation Army. The unit's
stated purpose was to fight Honduran leftists, including a
fledgling rebel army that was backed by both the Nicaraguan
government and Marxist rebels in El Salvador. In practice, the
cable stated, the unit's operations ``included surveillance,
kidnappings, interrogations under duress, and execution of
prisoners who were Honduran revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reports of Honduran military abuses followed a major army
operation in 1983 in the northwestern province of Olancho, where
the small rebel force was active.
</P>
<P>
   Although the inspector general's report is not entirely clear on
the subject because of its heavy redactions, it appears to show
that the agency failed to properly investigate and inform Congress
about reports that the military executed a number of prisoners
during the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people reported killed during the operation was an
American Jesuit priest, the Rev. James Carney. Although the report
does not resolve questions about how Carney died, it suggests that
the CIA received numerous allegations that he was among the
prisoners who were executed. Guerrillas with whom Carney was
traveling said he died of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more substantial information in this report than the
CIA has ever given before,'' the Honduran human rights ombudsman,
Valladares, said in a telephone interview from Tegucigalpa. ``It is
an important first step.''

DRUG TO HELP DIABETICS RETAIN SIGHT SAILS THROUGH TESTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug that might help prevent complications from diabetes that
cause blindness has sailed through its first safety tests on
humans, researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The results ``support going on with the larger trials to look at
whether this drug will prevent or reduce visual loss'' caused by
the disease, said Dr. Lloyd P. Aiello of the Joslin Diabetes Center
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were in the first phase of safety trials for
LY333531, a drug developed by Joslin researchers along with
scientists at Eli Lilly and Co., which already has set up the
second phase of tests.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of diabetes, which affects about 16 million people
in the United States, suffers from lack of effective ways to
prevent the serious and sometimes deadly complications of the
disease, although strict control of diabetics' blood sugar can
help.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness, causing 12,000
to 24,000 new cases annually.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Joslin researchers reported in the journal Science that
LY333531, when given to diabetic rats, reversed the kind of
blood-vessel changes that lead to blindness and kidney damage, two
of the most serious complications.
</P>
<P>
   No studies have shown that treatment with the drug will actually
prevent organ damage, but the scientists are hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard
Medical School, headed the study that he reported Friday at a
research symposium marking the centennial of the Joslin center.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 21 diabetics were given the drug for a month, in
varying doses, while six other patients received a placebo. All of
the subjects had experienced potentially harmful changes in the
blood flow in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One abnormality among the diabetics was a slowing of blood flow
through the fine vessels of the eye, which scientists believe is
due to a thickening or constriction of the vessel walls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the patients showed signs of blood leakage from the
vessels that line the retina. The scientists measured this by
injecting a fluorescent dye into the bloodstream that could be
detected by scanning the back of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has linked these abnormalities to excessive
glucose, a form of sugar, in the bloodstream, which is a hallmark
of diabetes. How glucose damages the eye isn't entirely known. But
Joslin researchers have shown that as blood glucose rises, so does
the activity of a substance called protein kinase C beta that may
trigger the blood-vessel changes. The drug LY333531 protects the
vessels by blocking protein kinase C beta.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the month-long trial was to look for adverse
effects of LY333531, and none were found at any of the different
doses, said Aiello, though one patient had a ``nonserious'' and
temporary drop in white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Encouragingly, he said, the patients that received the drug
experienced a significant increase in circulation through the eyes
and a significant decrease in leakage from the retinal vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these improvements in circulation will prevent or reduce
vision loss won't be known until patients have taken the drug for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   In another report at the Joslin conference, researchers also
said that LY333531, when given in combination with Vitamin E to
diabetic rats, improved blood flow to nerves. Nerve damage caused
by impaired circulation is another common complication of diabetes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On this day of marvels, there was a soaring plane
ride with propellers chopping and stomachs quivering. There were
giddy imaginings of steely skyscrapers, the Statue of Liberty and
the never-experienced shivers of a Cuban family's first blustery
October.
</P>
<P>
   But for the family of Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the best
moment came when they finally landed in Teterboro, N.J., Friday
morning, ending 10 long months of separation in a flurry of hugs
and tears.
</P>
<P>
   His daughters, Yahumara, 8, and Steffi, 2, fell into his arms,
crying, ``Papi, papi!'' And his mother, Maria Julia Pedroso Cruz,
and his former wife, Norma Alvira Manso, peppered his grinning face
with kisses until he whisked them away in a white limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the dazzled relatives got their first glimpse of
Yankee Stadium before joining the ballplayers who swept up Broadway
through the swirl of confetti and the crush of cheering fans. And
as Hernandez's mother stood on a platform at City Hall, in a city
she never dreamed she would ever see, she looked in awe at the
crowd that roared, ``Du-que! Du-que!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything so beautiful,'' Mrs. Pedroso said
after watching proudly as her son accepted the keys to the city in
his newly adopted land. ``I'm so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The family reunion capped an amazing year for Hernandez, who
fled Cuba on a raft, signed a three-year, $6.6 million contract
with the Yankees and pitched his team to victory in Game 2 of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And it was all the sweeter because it was so surprising, a
diplomatic coup achieved through the intercession of Cardinal John
O'Connor and the unexpected generosity of Cuban President Fidel
Castro, who gave the family permission to celebrate with Hernandez
in New York City. The relatives plan to return to Cuba, according
to Rene Guim, the spokesman for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Castro did the same last year for Hernandez's half-brother,
Livan, who defected from Cuba and joined the Florida Marlins team
that won the 1997 World Series. His mother, who is not Mrs.
Pedroso, sat in the stands for his last game. But pleading the case
for El Duque was tougher because his defection was more painful for
the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez was only a rookie, a good prospect. El Duque, on
the other hand, was the best pitcher in the history of Cuban
baseball when he left Cuba on a raft last December. In January,
Castro branded him a ``mercenary of sports'' who had ``betrayed his
country.'' And this fall, El Duque lashed back, telling reporters
that he hoped Castro was watching his success on television.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paredes, the emissary sent to Cuba on Wednesday by
O'Connor, knew all of this. He understood why Hernandez, who longed
to see his family, had asked the cardinal to intercede on his
behalf. But while he packed his briefcase with a letter from the
cardinal that he would hand-deliver to Castro, he felt the mission
was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess to you, I was convinced it would not happen,''
said Paredes, executive director of the Northeast Hispanic Catholic
Center, who has organized several religious pilgrimages to Cuba.
``El Duque, since he left Cuba, has been quite vocal in speaking
about the Castro regime, and not in favorable terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But by evening, after a flurry of meeting with religious and
political officials, Castro granted the request of the cardinal,
who opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba and has met twice with
Castro. And within minutes, Paredes was on the phone to Hernandez,
who was sitting in the dugout during the last World Series game
against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle we got through,'' said Paredes, who said a
team official rushed the cellular phone to Hernandez. ``He began to
cry. He said, `I thank the almighty God for this gift.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba specialists say Castro's decision likely reflects both a
personal gesture of respect for O'Connor and an effort to deepen
his already improving relationship with the Roman Catholic Church.

NORTH CAROLINA SENATE RACE JUST KEEPS GETTING NASTIER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ With his seat in jeopardy, Republican Senator
Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina has resorted to a media campaign
depicting John Edwards, his boyish-looking Democratic rival, as a
predatory trial lawyer, a pawn of union bosses, a compatriot of
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and, worst of all, a ``Bill Clinton
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous effort to demonize me, that's clear,''
said Edwards as he talked about his surprisingly strong challenge
to Faircloth over a bowl of chowder after an appearance here.
``None of it's the truth. I'm a mainstream North Carolinian.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has launched negative ads, accusing Faircloth of voting
to cut Medicare by $270 billion and holding ``one of the worst
attendance records in the Senate.'' The counteroffensive has caused
Faircloth to cry foul, too.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial, the Greensboro News &AMP; Record deplored a ``3-M
campaign'' involving ``mud, money, and manipulation of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For a state proud of its distinguished universities,
sophisticated newspapers, and visionary ``Research Triangle,''
North Carolina's political campaigns continue to appeal to a
segment of the population that worships Richard Petty and old-time
religion.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Faircloth's defense of his seat has adopted the
strategy of Jesse Helms, the state's other senator. Helms has held
office for 26 years in part because of relentlessly unfavorable TV
ads raising suspicions about each of his opponents. Faircloth's
television spots are being produced by Alex Castellanos, the
Republican consultant responsible for ads accentuating racial
issues that Helms used against Harvey Gantt, a black candidate, in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that the tone will get no nicer this year,
Faircloth has just fired his pollster and hired Arthur Finkelstein,
another strategist with a reputation for harsh attacks. Finkelstein
helped shape state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone's strategy of casting
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci as a liberal in Malone's unsuccessful
bid for this year's Republican gubernatorial nomination in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tip-off because Finkelstein has been an integral
player in Helms's campaigns,'' said Ferrel Guillory, director of
the Program on Southern Politics, Media and Public Life at the
University of North Carolina. ``Helms pioneered the `assault your
candidate' advertising style. It's a tried and true way to get your
base out. But it's not one of North Carolina's finest exports.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Faircloth have been made under the pressure of a
close contest. Two recent polls concluded that the race is a
statistical dead heat. Faircloth led by two points in one survey
and Edwards held a two-point edge in the other. Both leads fell
within the polls' margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 45, is projecting himself as a fresh face, ``a fierce
independent advocate for the people,'' as he characterized himself
the other day in a meeting with supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faircloth has been in the Senate for six years,'' Edwards
said. ``People don't have any idea what he's done, and he's not
telling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, 70, built a fortune as a farmer and businessman and
served as a Democratic official in state government before
switching parties and ousting the late Senator Terry Sanford in
1992. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Faircloth
has has helped increase North Carolina's share of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though a colleague of Helms, Faircloth has moderated his
approach in the past two years, supporting several environmental
initiatives and breaking with Helms's Congressional Club, an
organization of conservative leaders in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards had never run for public office and admits he was
startled when he won a majority over six other candidates in the
Democratic primary. He is believed to have spent about $4 million
of his own money in a campaign that has cost nearly $6 million thus
far. He refuses to accept political action committee, or PAC,
money.
</P>
<P>
   The Faircloth operation, which has spent more than $7 million,
insists that Edwards's assertion of running a clean campaign, free
of PAC money, is disingenuous because the state Democratic Party is
underwriting many of the attack ads. ``Edwards is running negative
ads that distort Senator Faircloth's position that are paid for by
PAC money laundered through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee,'' said Jonathan Felts, spokesman for the Faircloth
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the distortion is being committed by Faircloth. One
Faircloth ad suggests that Edwards is prone to exaggeration and
features a 10-year-old videotape of a lecture where Edwards advises
other plaintiff attorneys to ``blow it up'' if they learn a
defendant is worth $40 million. Edwards said he was talking about
magnifying the figure on a slide screen.
</P>
<P>
   While Faircloth has been pounding on Edwards's record as a trial
lawyer who has won millions of dollars in claims, the Winston-Salem
Journal reported that Faircloth has a taste for litigation, too. He
and his various businesses have filed more than 500 lawsuits since
1957, the paper said. Faircloth dismissed his suits as ``little
piddling cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges and countercharges continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've quit watching television,'' Edwards said. ``It creates an
enormous cynicism. Money plays a role, but the really bad thing is
the negative ads. Regular people turn on TV and it makes them sick
to their stomach.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a morning and afternoon filled with speeches
and platitudes for one of the great teams of all time, Friday's
Yankee celebration at City Hall began to wind down. Finally, the
announcement came that Tony Bennett, the great singer who had
performed ``America the Beautiful,'' would come back and sing a
duet with Max Von Essen, who had sung the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that wasn't going to happen; I'd spoken with Bennett
shortly after he sang, and he was hurrying off to another
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, someone whispered in the ear of the master of
ceremonies, who then announced that Von Essen would sing by
himself. Bennett had done his part; he'd sung his song and split,
off to another gig. Just like that, Bennett reduced modern sports
to its contemporary essence. In the parlance of jazz, baseball is
just another gig.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lesson that Bernie Williams is about to learn. The
Yankee center fielder received enthusiastic, heartfelt cheers from
those attending the tribute, many of whom stood and applauded as he
stepped to the podium. Williams' standoffish demeanor throughout
the playoffs was taken by some as a signal that he was preparing
himself _ and Yankees fans _ for his departure via free agency.
There has been other conjecture that personal problems led to his
aloofness. Nevertheless, the question lingered for the fans: would
New York be just another gig for Williams, or an enduring
homestand?
</P>
<P>
   As Williams tried to speak, fans chanted: ``Bernie, Stay!
Bernie, Stay!'' And Williams could have responded: ``George Must
Pay! George Must Pay!''
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, is the dialogue of the '90s. Even on a glorious
day at the end of a championship season, the cash register is ever
present. Each side has one. Friday marked the end of the Baseball
Season and the beginning of the Business of Baseball Season. From
now until April, owners, general managers and managers will look at
their rosters with cold, calculating eyes. Who to lop off? Who to
trade? Who to keep?
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about Yankee teamwork and a team full of
average Joes, the Yankees had the resources to stock their team
with solid veterans at every position _ not just three or four
positions, but all of them. And then they put solid backups in
every position.
</P>
<P>
   My vote, at this juncture, is for Williams to go West; or East
or South, or wherever they're offering the most money. The
modern-day player has options. The fans pleaded: ``Bernie, Stay!
Bernie, Stay!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, the fans wouldn't have chanted: ``Babe, Please Stay.
Babe, Please Stay.'' Babe Ruth had no choice. The players were
serfs. No rights, no options. No dignity or respect except that
which the owners chose to give them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the balance has shifted enough that players and owners
assume the same mercenary attitude toward each other: screwdrivers,
waiting to twist each other into the wall at the first available
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has now won two World Series championships, been a
mainstay on a team with the best record in baseball history and has
made two All-Star teams. Realistically, things can only go downhill
from this point.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams takes the Yankees' money _ say $50 million to $55
million over five years _ and the Yankees don't win it all next
season or, heaven forbid, fail to make the World Series _ who do
you think will take the blame? ``Greedy Bernie,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   Williams knows from experience that there's nothing more
excruciating than being tarred and feathered in New York. If he
goes to, say, Colorado for $60 million to $70 million over six
seasons he may falter and take heat, but at least the extra $10
million to $15 million will be a ``misery bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bennett left City Hall, he chatted briefly about growing
up in in Queens loving baseball. He was born in 1926, one year
before the terrifying Yankees of 1927 cast a shadow that every
Yankees team has been trying to get out from under ever since.
Seventy-two years later, Bennett was at City Hall, belting out
``America the Beautiful'' for the World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   He also illuminated a subtle reality for Williams. Yes, it was a
wonderful day Friday. The ``Bernie, Stay! Bernie, Stay!'' chants
must have been heartwarming for Williams, who has had his feelings
crushed by the Yankees in previous negotiations. But beware of the
siren's song. Baseball is a series of gigs. Some last one year,
some two, some three.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett sang his song, sang it well, then split. Yankee
Stadium or City Hall: in the end, it's just another gig.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine days and nights of tortuous
negotiations, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel Friday signed a modest
agreement that restores life to the Middle East peace effort and
opens the way for talks on a final resolution of the 50-year-old
fight over whether the Palestinians will have a state.
</P>
<P>
   A proud, relieved President Clinton, who had seen the agreement
threatened by a last-minute dispute with Netanyahu over the fate of
the spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, presided over the signing ceremony in
the White House. He was joined as host by a visibly ailing King
Hussein of Jordan, who had been called in to push the talks toward
a conclusion and spoke movingly of a search for peace that has
consumed much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the king, wan and hairless from the effects of
cancer therapy, beside the aged Arafat, still in his familiar
headdress and uniform but with the trembling lip caused by ill
health poignantly visible, seemed to underscore the long,
debilitating path to even this relatively modest breakthrough in
the talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement in part serves to commit the two sides once again
to actions they had already promised in 1993 and 1995 in agreements
in Oslo, setting a detailed timetable for the Israelis to withdraw
from 13 percent more of the West Bank in three phases over 12 weeks
starting as soon as the agreement is ratified. That would bring to
40 percent the total territory that the Palestinians control fully
or partially. In return the accord provides for specific steps by
the Palestinians to fight terrorism and formally amend its charter
to expunge clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Netanyahu, who make no attempt to disguise their
personal dislike, Friday shook hands under the gaze of the king of
Jordan and spoke words of peace and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never leave the peace process, and we will never go
back to violence and confrontation,'' Arafat said to applause in
the White House East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu declared: ``Today is a day when Israel and our entire
region are more secure. Now this has required sacrifice from both
sides, and reaching into what Lincoln called the better nature of
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the agreement an effort ``to rebuild trust and
renew hope for peace.'' But he urged the leaders to ``carry out
their commitments'' and to have the courage to withstand the
inevitable attacks from ``the enemies of peace'' from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   This final tableau of hope and self-congratulation was delayed
and slightly soured, officials said, by an extraordinary
last-minute demand by Netanyahu _ at 7 a.m. after the final
substance of the accord had been settled during a sleepless night _
that the United States release Pollard, an American convicted of
spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the demand to release Pollard, imprisoned since
1985, immediately. But he promised at the White House ceremony ``to
review this matter seriously,'' a significant concession in itself
since this president and two predecessors have reviewed and
rejected numerous appeals for pardon, clemency and parole for
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   In return for this public promise, which may help Netanyahu with
his right wing at home, officials said, the Israeli prime minister
agreed to sign Friday's agreement and not renege on his promise to
release 750 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This agreement is designed to carry out long-delayed Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank called for under the 1993 and 1995
Oslo accords. Netanyahu campaigned for office as an opponent of
those accords, by which Israel and the Palestinians recognize each
other's right to live in peace and commit themselves to
negotiations on a final settlement between them.
</P>
<P>
   These withdrawals were supposed to take place as interim steps,
to build up confidence, but instead they created a mounting crisis
of mistrust and anger, as Netanyahu insisted that the Palestinians
keep specific commitments to fight terrorism and restrain the
number of weapons in areas they control in return for land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous American efforts, it has taken 19 months _ and
then these 9 long days and nearly 90 hours of Clinton's own time _
to seal even this interim deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is ``a big step that came too late,'' Clinton
acknowledged. ``It is true that whatever we achieved is only
temporary and that it has been late, but our agreement underscores
that the peace process is going ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the risks and costs of failure, these talks
were an enormous success.
</P>
<P>
   However difficult the sessions at the Wye River Conference
Centers on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and however modest the
specifics of this deal, an inability to reach agreement here would
have had serious consequences for the Middle East and American
stature in the region, especially among Washington's moderate Arab
allies.
</P>
<P>
   With another crisis brewing with Iraq and with the deadline for
the entire Oslo process running out next May, senior U.S. officials
say, they understood that American strategic interests required
progress here and a quick start on trying to resolve the most
difficult questions of Palestine's borders, whether it will be a
state or not and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this accord, intensive negotiations are to begin
immediately on a final peace settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians, but given the delay and the onset of the Jewish
Sabbath, when the Israeli government does not work, those talks
could not get started Friday, as American officials had hoped.
Instead, they will open after this agreement is ratified, and
Clinton may invite these leaders back for another summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days before the Nov. 3 elections, the accord was also an
important diplomatic triumph for Clinton, who could bask in the
praise of the participants for his intensive and imaginative
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in particular, was unstinting in his praise for
Clinton, calling him a tireless and boundlessly optimistic man with
``a precious and unique gift,'' the ability ``to nudge and prod and
suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore the
possibilities of both sides, and never just on one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, an American official said, helped ameliorate the
``sour mood'' created when Netanyahu ``created a needless crisis
this morning in a clumsy attempt to get something he could not
have,'' the release of Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Clinton praised Netanyahu for his strength, will and
grasp of detail. ``He showed himself willing to take political
risks for peace, but not to risk the security of his people,'' the
president said. ``As a result, this agreement embodies an enormous
increase in the security of the people of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words also reflect an American judgment, officials
said, that Netanyahu is politically strong in Israel, despite his
willingness to anger his own right wing, and is likely to win
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu even thanked Arafat for his cooperation and his wishes
for a happy 49th birthday on the very day, Wednesday, that the
Israeli threatened to leave the talks before backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat spoke of Netanyahu as a ``co-partner'' in peace like his
favorite Israeli, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated in 1995. To applause, Arafat acknowledged the
difficulties of getting this accord but vowed, ``We will never
leave the peace process. and we will never go back to violence and
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hussein, who intervened at key moments in the talks, as the
Americans asked him to, with emotional appeals for peace and stern
admonishments for narrow politics, said Israel and the Palestinians
were moving in the right direction. The king appealed to the better
instincts of everyone in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste,'' the king said. ``And it's time that together we occupy a
place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them and of
their sons, the descendants of the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders then signed the accords on a walnut conference table
bought by President Grant in 1869 and last used in 1994 for the
peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed by Rabin and
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement itself, with small variations from a longstanding
American proposal widely published in the past, gives benefits to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis won the formal, public change in the Palestinian
charter that Netanyahu and his influential industry minister, Natan
Sharansky, have insisted upon: to remove the 26 clauses calling for
Israel's destruction. While Arafat says the clauses are long gone,
the Israelis demanded a formal vote by the large Palestine National
Council, which contains expatriates and terrorists living abroad.
While there is some fudging over how the Palestine National Council
will be defined in the accord _ it will be subsumed in a larger
gathering of other Palestinian organizations more easily controlled
by Arafat, and which Clinton has agreed to attend _ Israel will get
the public ``turning of the page'' that Sharansky wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have also won a Palestinian pledge to jail 30 of
the 31 Palestinians wanted in Israel for killing Israelis, while
the Central Intelligence Agency will monitor their incarceration
and their cases. Israel did not get Arafat to agree to jail the
chief of the Palestinian police in Gaza, Ghazi Jabali.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for their part, got an agreement from the
Israelis to release 750 prisoners in three stages and a guarantee
that they will get a third Israeli redeployment from the West Bank,
as called for under the Oslo accords. But Israel gets to determine
the redeployment's size, which Netanyahu has told his Cabinet will
be between 1 percent and 2 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that will bring areas under Palestinian partial or full
control to more than 40 percent of the West Bank _ the basis for
the Palestinian state that Arafat dreams of and that even the
hawkish Israeli foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, admits is now
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether this agreement brings a Palestinian state
closer into being, an Arafat aide, Marwan Kanafani, smiled broadly
and said simply, ``Yes.''

DAVEY JOHNSON NAMED NEW DODGERS MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   c, 1998 N.Y. TIMES NEWS SERVICE    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, who has the toughest time getting and holding
managerial jobs, added a fourth team to his resume Friday. The Los
Angeles Dodgers named Johnson successor to Walter Alston, Tommy
Lasorda, Bill Russell and Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to improve our on-base percentage, score more runs,
have hitters go deeper into the count,'' Kevin Malone, the Dodgers'
new general manager, said, sounding as if he wanted to copy the
Yankees' strategy for success. ``Davey can have a major impact on
the approach and the philosophy of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went further at a news conference in Los Angeles,
referring to the Yankees as ``a great team,'' and adding, ``The
Dodgers have always had great teams and great leadership and that's
what we need to get back to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the Cincinnati Reds and the Baltimore Orioles preceded
the Dodgers on Johnson's resume. In his 10 full seasons of major
league managing, Johnson has finished first or second each year. He
won division championships with each of the three teams and the
World Series with the Mets in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned from the Orioles' job _ before he could be fired _
on the day last November on which he was named American League
manager of the year. In accepting a three-year contract with the
Dodgers, he recalled how he had experienced some significant highs
and lows with Los Angeles in his baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill of my life was beating the Dodgers four
straight in the 1966 World Series,'' he said, referring to his days
as an Orioles second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low point in my career was in 1988, when they beat my
team,'' he continued, recalling his days as Mets' manager. ``A guy
named Scioscia hit a homer and broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone had tried to lure Felipe Alou from the Montreal Expos to
be the Dodgers' manager, but the Expos gave Alou a new three-year
contract worth $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Until the past few years, Dodgers' managers had jobs seemingly
for life. Alston managed them for 23 years and Lasorda 20 years
less two months. Russell succeeded Lasorda on July 29, 1996 but was
fired last June 22, after an ownership change. Hoffman was brought
up from the minor leagues to manage the rest of the season, then
was removed after Malone became general manager.

COMMENTARY: AN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA FOR THE WORLD'S FAITHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Pa.)  (js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Museum of Natural History might seem an
unlikely place for a conference dealing with religious traditions.
But the intersection of faith and science was the focus of a
gathering there on Wednesday called ``Religion and Ecology:
Discovering the Common Ground.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Evelyn Tucker, one of the event's prime movers, took
the podium, she set forth a couple of direct questions to link the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the ethical traditions of the world's major
religions, Ms. Tucker, an associate professor of religion at
Bucknell University, asked, ``Can the power of their texts,
symbols, rituals and teachings be brought to bear on the global
environmental crisis? Could this viewpoint expand our vision so
that we might finally begin to reverse the destruction of our
planet?''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Ms. Tucker and her husband, John Grim,
who also teaches in Bucknell's religion department, have been
focusing on these questions. They have been aided by a growing body
of scholars representing the world's major faiths, as well as a few
interested scientists and public policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Harvard University's Center for the Study of
World Religions, the couple arranged separate academic conferences
on the environmental perspectives of 10 different traditions:
Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism,
Judaism, Taoism, Shinto and indigenous, or tribal, religions. Last
week's meeting served as a kind of summing-up of those conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many religious believers have long been involved in
trying to rally public awareness of the degradation of the natural
environment, whether it be dirty air and water, the destruction of
forests or other problems. Their concerns have often found their
way into statements and resolutions issued by religious
organizations, which have urged their followers toward faithful
``stewardship'' of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United Methodist Church's book of rules and
principles, the Book of Discipline, contains a detailed section on
the environment. ``Water, air, soil, minerals, energy resources,
plants, animal life and space are to be valued and conserved
because they are God's creation and not solely because they are
useful to human beings,'' the book states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conferences arranged by Ms. Tucker and Grim have
sought to go another step, at least on an intellectual level, by
exploring how ideas within all the major faiths could further
conservation of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The concluding event this week ran for two days, beginning with
a report on the conferences at U.N. headquarters, during which
leaders of the effort announced plans for a scholarly network, the
Forum on Religion and Ecology, to keep the discussions going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project is primarily intellectual,'' Grim said. But, he
added, ``We hope to network with organizations that are in the
pews, in the mosques, in the synagogues.''
</P>
<P>
   The event drew several scholars and others with an interest in
the environment, including Maurice Strong, an adviser to the
secretary-general of the United Nations who organized the 1992
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; Tu Weiming, a professor of Chinese
history and philosophy at Harvard; Lawrence Sullivan, director of
the Harvard center; and Timothy Wirth, a former under secretary of
state for global affairs, who is president of the United Nations
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Weiming, who is also the director of the Harvard-Yenching
Institute, quoted an African proverb: ``The earth is not ours, it
is a treasure we hold in trust for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scientists on the program at the Natural History
Museum was Niles Eldredge, a paleontologist who is chief curator of
the museum's newly opened Hall of Biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Eldredge said that while he was thoroughly
opposed to ``watering down'' school curriculums to appease
conservative anti-evolutionists, he was also ``sick of the supposed
war between science and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge said he thought religious groups ought to be involved
in the movement for environmental protection, in part because
``there's an ecological component to all concepts of God.''
</P>

   Ms. Tucker and Grim said plans are under way for two more
conferences at Harvard next year _ one on what religions have to
say about animals, the other on religion and evolution. Looking
ahead, Grim said he hoped conferences could be arranged in other
cities at which religious scholars and leaders could consider
regional environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said she saw these efforts as providing the basis for
an academic specialty in religious and ecological studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create a field of study that can blossom and
flourish,'' she said.

MISSOURI CAN'T SHAKE DISAPPOINTMENT OF '97 NEBRASKA GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To celebrate its third national championship in the past four
years, Nebraska produced a video highlight film that chronicled
1997, the final season for coach Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the video is ``No Doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   And while that is understandably prejudiced, there was plenty of
skepticism floating in the chilly air last Nov. 8 in Columbia, Mo.
An inspired Missouri team was leading top-ranked Nebraska, 38-31,
with 1:02 remaining. The 'Huskers started their final possession on
their own 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? Down seven with 1:02 left, there's a lot of
doubts,'' Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost said after the game last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the memory of what transpired is still revered by
the 'Huskers and raw for the Tigers. However it is remembered _ The
Play, The Catch, The Kick _ it has been a discussion topic prior to
today's Big 12 Conference game in Lincoln, Neb., between No. 7
Nebraska and No. 19 Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   That 67-yard drive culminated in the play of the season, a play
that will probably be famous for years. On Nebraska's final play,
Frost's pass was bobbled and kicked by receiver Shevin Wiggins. The
ball caromed into the end zone, where it was caught just above
grass level by freshman Matt Davison.
</P>
<P>
   The game-tying touchdown gave Nebraska the opportunity to win in
overtime, 45-38, preserving its undefeated season. The 'Huskers
went on to a 13-0 finish and a share of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   For Missouri, Wiggins' kick and Davison's catch was a knife to
the heart. ``It was just a stupid, fluke play,'' Missouri coach
Larry Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, here's a slow-motion distant replay of the
final seven seconds of the game.
:07
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska faces a third-and-10 from the Missouri 12. The 'Huskers
call their last timeout for what probably is their last play. On
the sideline, Osborne and assistant coach Ron Brown huddle with
Frost, the receivers and running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne calls ``shotgun 99 double slant.'' Two wide receivers,
two receivers in the slot, all running slant patterns. It's a play
that Nebraska has practiced, but has never run in a game. The
primary receiver is wingback Lance Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance looked over to me and I looked at him like, `Our side?'
because they kept going to the other side,'' Davison said. ``He
gave me the signal for the play and I was like, `Whoa! Well, let's
make something happen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The play clock was running down and I barely got set before we
snapped it.''
:06
</P>
<P>
   Frost takes the shotgun snap from center Josh Heskew. Frost is
at the Missouri 18 and he drops back two steps to the 20. He looks
to his left for Lance Brown, who had lined up in the slot, inside
of Davison.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is open, but Frost sees that if he throws the pass, Brown
could be stopped short of the end zone. The clock would run out
before another play could be run.
</P>
<P>
   In the press box, a drained Frank Solich, then Nebraska's
assistant head coach, sees that the play is breaking down. Both Ron
Brown and Solich see Frost starting to improvise.
:05
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking, but Frost has time. None of the four
Missouri pass rushers is within five yards of him. Seeing that
Lance Brown is covered, Frost shifts his feet to his right. He sets
his sights on Wiggins, who had lined up in the left slot inside of
wide receiver Kenny Cheatham.
</P>
<P>
   Davison sees where Frost is looking. He starts running to his
right, paralleling the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had that play covered pretty well,'' Larry Smith
said.
:04
</P>
<P>
   Frost has taken four bunny hops, keeping his feet active. He
steps up to the Missouri 15 and puts his entire body behind a
down-the-middle throw for Wiggins. Umpire Richard Whittenberg ducks
as the ball zips past.
:03.5
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is at the goal line when the pass, slightly behind him,
bounces off his chest. Missouri defensive back Julian Jones has
been with Wiggins every step, but he's slightly behind him in the
end zone. Jones bumps Wiggins just before the ball arrives, but no
penalty is called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was interfered with,'' Wiggins said. ``I felt him
tugging on my left arm. The ball hit me and rolled down my body.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball begins to fall toward the ground. Brown starts to dive,
reaching for the deflection.
:03
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins is falling backward. Just before the ball hits the
ground, it hits off his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably was a natural reaction,'' he said. ``I thought I
had a chance to pull it in myself, I was just trying to gather it
in. My leg went up and the ball happened to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri defensive back Harold Piersey reaches out to try to
grab an interception. ``It was on my fingertips and he just kicked
it out of my hands,'' Piersey said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball doesn't get more than four feet off the ground on its
redirected journey into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he knew what he did, to be honest,'' Larry Smith
said. ``Anybody that thinks he did it on purpose, that's a bunch of
baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules prohibit intentionally kicking the ball.
:02.5
</P>
<P>
   Davison has run past his defender, Missouri's Chad Criss. He
sees the ball tumbling, the moment reduced to slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was floating like a punt, kind of end over end, it just
seemed like forever for the ball to get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davison dives and his hands slip under the ball before it hits
the ground between the ``O'' and the ``U'' in ``Missouri'' in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess instinct took over,'' said Davison, who is from
Tecumseh, Neb. ``I came here to catch the football. Maybe not quite
like that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Back judge Larry Girouard, who is about five yards from Davison,
wastes little time. His arms shoot up in the air to signal
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping they were going to call it a catch because
it was close enough that the officials had to make a good call to
see that I really caught it,'' Davison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he had it, I just wasn't sure the officials knew he had
it,'' Frost said. ``I saw Matt holding up the ball and saw the
officials' arms go up. It was an unbelievable feeling of relief.''
:02
</P>
<P>
   Davison's right knee is on the ground, as is his right hand. His
left hand holds the ball aloft. Lance Brown is on both knees at the
goal line, both arms thrust high in the air. Missouri's Jones,
Criss and Caldrinoff Easter are frozen onlookers, trying to
comprehend what they've just seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Oh man, I can't believe what just happened,' ''
Easter said. ``It was just disbelief.''
:01
</P>
<P>
   Davison sprints out of the end zone as the clock ticks to 0:00.
He flips the ball away and is tackled by a jubilant Lance Brown at
the Missouri 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was running down the field,'' Davison said.
``I looked back and saw the fans rushing the field and I thought
they had called it incomplete.''
Epilogue
</P>
<P>
   Missouri fans rush out of the north end zone to celebrate an
apparent victory. They start assaulting the goal post. After about
10 seconds, public address announcer Jim Hall repeats the woeful
words, ``Touchdown, Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska kicker Kris Brown of Southlake Carroll High School
still had to kick a game-tying extra point. ``The goal posts were
still swaying from the fans being up there,'' he said. ``I was
kicking at a moving target.''
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Missouri elected to play defense first. Smith now
second-guesses that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what had happened, our defense was not mentally ready,''
he said. ``The rule of thumb in overtime is to play defense first.
But I should have sent our offense out there first.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska scored on Frost's 12-yard run, his fourth rushing
touchdown of the game. The game ended when Missouri quarterback
Corby Jones was sacked on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is within your grasp, you're one play away and
you can see it,'' Smith said. ``That's what makes it so tough. One
stinkin' play, that's all it was.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the weekend jogger who plods in designer Spandex and $150
shoes, the Grand Am GT strikes an athletic pose. The front and rear
fascias are even more aggressive than the SE's; there is a
wide-open air dam so the Ram Air system can breathe freely; thick
ribs run up and down the body-side cladding; low-profile tires
clench 16-inch wheels, and the exhaust rumbles a bit through four
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But like the occasional runner who stumbles into a time trial,
the GT proves itself a poseur with more flash than dash. Yes, its
3.4-liter V6 is willing, with the Ram Air induction funneling cool,
pressurized air into the engine, raising horsepower to 175 and peak
torque to 205 foot-pounds (from the SE's 170/195).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the four-wheel disk brakes are very good. And yes, the
suspension is stiffer than the SE's, and the ride is rougher as a
result. But the GT, as either a coupe or sedan, would rather sprint
in a straight line than run in zigzags.
</P>
<P>
   You can attribute this misdemeanor to the usual
front-wheel-drive suspects: There is serious understeer, which
requires the driver to compensate constantly for the way the car
plows ahead when the wheel is turned, and torque steer, which makes
the GT's extra power a liability by whipsawing the front wheels on
quick takeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the GT was excessively jumpy on harsh pavement, and the
body leaned too much _ for an ostensibly sporty car _ on curves.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the GT will disappoint everyone. It is
inoffensive on smooth, straight roads, and it offers all the many
features of the SE, plus some extras.
</P>
<P>
   The zippy dashboard looks more at home in the GT coupe than in
the SE sedan, and the GT1 package includes a nifty sunroof that
opens at one touch of a button. The perforated leather buckets were
marginally more comfortable than the SE's cloth seats, though they
lacked side support. (Alas, the seatback release was notably
clunky.)
</P>
<P>
   The GT has the plumage, but compared with agile dancers like the
Mercury Cougar, Acura Integra or Honda Prelude, it trips over its
toes too often. It is a Rockette without much kick.

HOW CASTRO AGREED TO FREE FAMILY OF YANKEE PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inside the Palace of the Revolution in Havana late
Wednesday, Fidel Castro and two envoys sent by the archbishop of
New York sat down to watch Game 4 of the World Series via satellite
from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The emissaries carried a personal letter from Cardinal John
O'Connor, asking Castro to grant visas to the mother, former wife,
and two young daughters of Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez, who defected from Cuba last Christmas in a 20-foot
skiff.
</P>
<P>
   To their amazement, Castro agreed, calling O'Connor personally
in New York. The two emissaries then returned to their hotel,
picked up the phone, and dialed El Duque in the visitors clubhouse
at Qualcomm Stadium, where the powerful Yankees were about to sweep
the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very pleasant conversation,'' recalled Mario Paredes,
one of the archbishop's representatives, during an interview. ``We
just told him, `We need your mother's telephone number.'''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque's life has been a series of increasingly fantastic
episodes since he and seven others crashed into the Bahamas. He and
his companions had left Cuba shortly after Christmas and eventually
ran aground on the Bahamian island of Anguilla Cay, where they were
rescued by the US Coast Guard and taken to a detention center in
Nassau. After their release they traveled by Lear jet to San Jose,
Costa Rica, where El Duque, 29, tried out before 70 major league
scouts before signing a $6.6 million contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every day that passed, with every win, my past in Havana
would flash back in mind,'' he said early Friday while waiting for
his family to arrive in the lounge of the Teterboro, N.J., airport.
``It has all been so incredible. That is why I say all of this can
only be the wonderful work of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hernandez entourage landed here at 2:30 a.m. Friday on a
Lear jet chartered by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. It was the
culmination of extraordinary negotiations that, among other things,
seemed to demonstrate how the Catholic Church can serve as an
intermediary between the US and Cuban governments _ less than a
year after Pope John Paul II's historic visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. Friday, El Duque could be seen by a reporter walking
down Lexington Avenue in an olive suit on his way to buy milk for
his daughters, Yahumara, 8, and Steffi, 3. Hours later, he rode
with his teammates through the ``Canyon of Heroes'' in a victory
parade that caused a blizzard of tickertape, drew hundreds of
thousands of people, and brought most of Manhattan to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, El Duque was banned from Cuban baseball
for allegedly planning to emulate his younger half-brother, Livan,
and defect to the United States. He was living in a one-room
cinderblock extension of his in-laws' house. He earned $9 a month
working as a rehab therapist at the Havana Psychiatric Hospital. He
was so cut off that when Livan, a Florida Marlins pitcher who
defected in 1995, struck out 15 in the National League playoffs
last year, El Duque was sitting oblivious at a friend's house,
drinking beer and watching soap operas on a 13-inch black-and-white
TV. He learned of his brother's feat when a neighbor shouted the
news through a screen door.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a millionaire, his life the subject of book and movie
deals currently in the works. He was the winning pitcher of Game 4
of the American League Championship Series and Game 2 of the World
Series, a fitting conclusion to a season in which he went 12-4 as a
member of perhaps the greatest baseball team in history. He spent
this season living in the suite of a midtown hotel, surrounded by
clothes, electronic equipment, golf bags, and other material
courtesies of his new-found stardom in the mecca of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room he erected a makeshift shrine that he covered
with offerings _ candles, a sunflower, a Cuban cigar, red wine, and
a miniature Statue of Liberty _ he made to Chango, the deity of
Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is great,'' El Duque, crying, said to his mother,
54-year-old Maria Julia Pedroso, as his family disembarked Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si, senor,'' replied his mother, also weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Alvira Manso, the pitcher's 30-year-old former wife, stood
crying nearby. She said Cuban security agents had come to her door
the previous evening and told her to be at the airport within
hours. ``I didn't want to come,'' she said. ``All my family is back
in Cuba. I don't know anyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   With his exhausted daughters, who received 6-month visas to the
United States, dressed in Yankees caps and T-shirts and holding
plastic dolls, El Duque gathered up his family on the tarmac and
raised a champagne toast. ``We drink to God, to the reunification
of our family, and to love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of El Duque's dramatic odyssey has always been his
inability to see Yahumara and Steffi. He recorded videos of his
travels and spoke with his daughters frequently by phone, but was
uncertain when he would see them again.
</P>
<P>
   At the encouragement of Rene Guim, an associate of the pitcher's
agent, Joe Cubas, El Duque sent a letter Wednesday to Cardinal
O'Connor. ``Your Eminence,'' the pitcher wrote. ``I humbly ask you
to use your good offices with Cuban government officials to allow
my children to visit me.''
</P>
<P>
   The request seemed like a longshot. Since his defection, El
Duque has missed few opportunities to excoriate Castro: He called
the Cuban president ``the devil'' during a ``60 Minutes'' segment
earlier this year. For his part, Castro referred to El Duque _ whom
he invited to his 66th birthday _ as ``a mercenary.''
</P>
<P>
   But people involved in the negotiations said Castro was moved by
his friendship with O'Connor, a frequent critic of the US trade
embargo who was in Cuba in January for the papal visit. ``Fidel
likes O'Connor; there's a very personal rapport there,'' said
Paredes, a close adviser to the cardinal and his point man on
Latino affairs. ``He did it just for him. They told us very clearly
in the beginning that they could not approve this because El Duque
was very outspoken, too loud, and critical of the regime. Fidel
said this gesture was for His Eminence.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor dispatched Paredes and a New York physician, Ramon
Tallaj Fermin, to Havana. The two men carried a letter to Castro.
``I feel very moved by this plea,'' wrote the archbishop, ``and I
write you with the hope that you will permit the family of Mr.
Hernandez to travel to this country as soon as possible. ... In my
opinion, such a generous gesture would be very well received in New
York City and in all of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Close observers of Cuban affairs were surprised to see the
Catholic Church become involved so directly. ``The conventional
wisdom is that the church never serves as an interlocutor, and the
truth is that's exactly what they did,'' said a source who was
involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Castro summoned Paredes and Tallaj to the Palace of the
Revolution Wednesday evening. The two arrived to see El Comandante
in front of a television watching an English-language feed of the
Series. Paredes said that, despite the apparent animosity, Castro,
a former pitcher who continued to suit up in exhibition games after
the 1959 revolution, indicated he respected El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised; Fidel liked this kid,'' said Paredes. ``He
said he's a great sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   Paredes declined to say who Castro was rooting for or offer many
specifics on the meetings. Asked if Castro is a Yankees fan,
Paredes replied: ``He likes New York; remember he spent his
honeymoon in New York for six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Paredes and Tallaj returned to their hotel, Tallaj called a
friend in the Dominican Republic to get the phone number for
Qualcomm. The two phoned the stadium switchboard, told the operator
it was a family emergency and asked to talk to El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher received the call in the visitors clubhouse. ``I
didn't believe it,'' said El Duque, standing on the street in front
of his hotel as dawn approached Friday. ``You can look at me now.
There's still a part of me that doesn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The US government was reluctant to issue visas for the pitcher's
family even after Castro agreed, according to sources involved in
the negotiations. Part of the reluctance stemmed from earlier this
year, when State Department officials worked New Year's Eve to get
visas for El Duque and his fellow defectors, only to see him
declare residency in Costa Rica to avoid the Major League draft and
establish himself as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor once again was instrumental, placing calls to the White
House, the State Department, and the Department of Justice. New
York congressman Charles Schumer also made calls on El Duque's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how this compares with winning the World Series, El Duque
replied: ``This is my mother, my family, everything that brings me
happiness.'' He thanked ``the pope, Cardinal O'Connor, Mario
Paredes, the Vatican, the president, the vice president, the
Attorney General Janet Reno, the Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and everyone else who helped bring me this happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   When the subject of Castro was broached, he cut off the
question: ``I'm not going to talk about politics,'' said El Duque.

SEN. KERRY TESTS POLITICAL WATERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Senator John Kerry made a short drive Friday
on what may be a long journey, visiting New Hampshire in his first
appearance as a potential presidential candidate and receiving a
welcome that the senator and his aides believed gives them reason
to push forward.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigned from early morning until late at night, from
Portsmouth to Durham, Dover to Manchester. He lunched quietly with
Governor Jeanne Shaheen, talked with students at the University of
New Hampshire, huddled with union leaders in their aging
headquarters and helped raise money for local candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the reviews were largely favorable, though the
road ahead appeared no less daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he stands a good chance,'' said Richard Joy, the
president of the local Bricklayer's union.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockingham County Democratic chairman Bill Verge: ``The
people are excited. I think he's making a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken by most was the enormity of the challenge, to
overcome an already powerful organization put together by Vice
President Al Gore, and to lure prospective supporters away from
marquee Democrats who have run here in years gone by and may well
again, men like House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri
and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conversation right now in New Hampshire,'' Kerry
said, standing with reporters after a morning speech at UNH. ``I
need to listen to the people here, to see if they think my message
may resonate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a message founded on optimism and change, one that decries
what Kerry termed ``the smut'' of Washington politics and calls for
a more issues-oriented debate on the future of the nation's
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to ask the question, how is it that the richest
nation on the planet that has done so remarkably can be so
irresponsible with its children and their education,'' Kerry said
during his UNH appearance, which included a short speech and a
question-and-answer session with about 80 students.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry criticized the Republican-controlled Congress as being
``more partisan, more personal in its politics, less collegial,
more ideological,'' and said the country does not have the stomach
for or the interest in the impeachment process that is about to
begin. He described Clinton's adulterous affair with Monica
Lewinsky and his seven months of lies as ``egregiously silly, dumb,
bad,'' but in his strongest terms yet, said it does not amount to
an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in the country are sorting that out rather
effectively,'' he said, pointing to polls that typically show more
than 60 percent of the respondents opposing impeachment. ``But in
Washington, we are still grinding through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Kerry and his strategists acknowledge that Gore holds
an enormous advantage in stature, fund-raising ability and
organization. But they believe that over the course of the
campaign, voters _ and very likely, New Hampshire voters _ will
annoint a clear alternative to Gore in what will probably become a
two-candidate race. It is that second slot that Kerry is aiming to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The day was not marked by grand speeches or choreographed
events, but rather by the type of folksy, voter-by-voter
politicking that is typical of early presidential forays into New
Hampshire, where candidates usually achieve success in people's
living rooms, not on their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry seemed to smooth some harsh feelings with the leaders of
the Manchester Democratic City Committee, which accused him of
standing them up in two prior fund-raising events and passed a
motion in June not to issue him any further invitations. At Kerry's
appearance at the union hall here, the committee chairman, state
Representative Raymond Buckley, gave Kerry a bag of gifts that
included a map of New Hampshire, and the two joked about drawing a
line from Manchester to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But afterwards, Buckley lauded Gore's prospects and also
highlighted Kerrey and Gephardt while seeming to play down Kerry's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three candidates have significant support already and
the vice president is receiving the overwhelming support at this
time,'' Buckley said.

 &HT;    Nervous family will await Glenn's return
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of the countdown, when five, four,
three, two, one ignites the rocket engines of the space shuttle
Discovery, Annie Glenn will quietly begin counting back up again.
</P>
<P>
   She won't relax until the numbers in her head tick up to eight.
Eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To watch the shuttle launch, that's the scary part,'' said
Annie Glenn, the wife of Sen. John Glenn, who will be aboard the
shuttle. ``After they get into orbit, eight minutes later, then I
know that I'll be really relieved. My prayers will be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the world, John Glenn's return to space next
Thursday will be a vicarious thrill, a nostalgic journey. He was
the first American in orbit in 1962, a steadfast figure through 24
years in the United States Senate, and now at 77 a symbol of
relentless achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But to Annie Glenn he is a husband, and to their two children he
is Dad. For them, what's vicarious is intimate, what's thrilling is
just plain dangerous. Excitement for liftoff builds around the
globe, but in the Glenn family they call it something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not excitement. I'm nervous,'' Annie Glenn, 78,
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``To tell you the truth, all
of us are... it's just normal to be a little scared. There's
nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Annie Glenn, after 55 years of marriage to this man she
has known since they were playmates in New Concord, is no less
impressed with what he's doing than the rest of the world. In the
back of her mind, she admits she couldn't help but wonder if he'd
be able to carry off this grand ambition of his when he first got
that glint in his eye about getting back into space and she let go
a quiet ``uh-oh...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he could,'' she said, ``but I mean, you always
wonder...''
</P>
<P>
   Then she went to Houston and watched him train. She sat in on
classes, learned about the science he'd be doing, and clipped
training-gear snapshots with a tiny camera Discovery crew members
call the Annie-Cam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew before coming here that John's mind was very alert, and
John's memory just couldn't have been better, and I also knew about
him being in such good physical condition, but after being here for
two weeks and just watching him...'' she said, ``...he amazed me
with what he could learn and absorb and do. And physically what he
could do. It changed my mind completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for Lyn Glenn, their daughter, who at 51 would rather
Dad just didn't ride the shuttle, but wouldn't dream of asking him
not to. It obviously means so much to him. She struggles to think
of a time in her father's life when he seemed as happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his 70th birthday when he water-skied behind his boat,''
she said, grasping. ``He just thought that was the cat's meow.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not this. Nothing is like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally putting his life on the line, and there's
nothing that really compares to that,'' she said. ``It's that kind
of fiber or core of a person that is only brought to full fruition
very infrequently. It's not the common kind of path that most
people take.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a path that energizes John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Glenn said that in her visits to Houston her husband never
slept later than 6 a.m., and he never went near the bedroom before
10 p.m. He had late dinners after training, then signed autographs,
returned phone calls, wrote letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is at absolute peak life right now,'' Lyn Glenn
said. ``I think he is sustained by a level of energy and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watch him, I'm tired, but that's not him, that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Annie Glenn will fly with the other astronaut spouses
to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Lyn and David
Glenn, 53, a physician from northern California, will come over in
a separate plane.
</P>
<P>
   Much better than in 1962 when the young agency NASA refused to
let the family come to the launch site. The Glenn family watched on
three televisions in their Arlington, Va., home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's the only way I could,'' Annie Glenn said. ``And
it was good to be with my family and close friends, and it was in
my own home...''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Glenns have all taken physical exams so they can
get close to the astronaut they love. The final visit between John
and his family will be a meal Tuesday, after which Annie will begin
counting up to the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous but not unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to be at the airport in Columbus more than one time
to say goodbye to John as he goes overseas to combat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been there when John was a test pilot and he would come
home and tell me about different times when pieces of an airplane
had come off.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think it's been part of my life.

WEEKEND TALKS SEEN AS SEASON IS IMPERILED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Amid growing concern that the season will be in
jeopardy if the labor dispute runs into December, the chief
negotiators for the National Basketball Association owners and the
players have tentatively set meetings for this weekend in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   However, barring a major compromise, neither those talks nor a
bargaining session scheduled for next week would prevent the league
from canceling more games.
</P>
<P>
   A league official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday that it will announce next Wednesday or Thursday that it
will cancel the rest of November's games and, to avoid embarrassing
biweekly announcements of further cancellations, as much as the
first two weeks of December's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``November is pretty much gone and most of December is being
looked at,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The league has already canceled the 99 games of Nov. 3-16, an
average of nearly seven per team. The next round would lop more
than 20 games off each team's schedule, a total close to the number
of cancellations that Commissioner David Stern has implied would
jeopardize a legitimate season that would be embraced by fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put an exact date on it,'' said Russ Granik,
the deputy commissioner, ``but if you don't have an agreement by
early December, it gets harder and harder to have a season.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no negotiations since Oct. 13, but when the
sides meet they may want to rent a large ballroom. Billy Hunter,
the executive director of the union, said he had invited all
400-plus members to attend the talks, which will also include
owners and team representatives from the league's 29 teams. The
league holds the meetings of its Board of Governors on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tonight at the University of Houston, some players
held their first of several loosely planned exhibition games. The
original idea was to generate money for financially struggling
players during the lockout, which entered its 120th day and has
already cost the players nearly $100 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter tried to get the process moving last summer but had
little success in receiving firm commitments from players or
sponsors from the United States and abroad. If tonight's game was
indicative of future obstacles, the players have a lot of work
ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3,800 seats in a 6,600-seat arena had been sold before the
game. The proceeds benefit a local hospital's cancer care center
and not the players. The featured performers were scheduled to be
David Robinson and Tim Duncan, but the San Antonio twin towers
decided at the last minute to skip the game, as did several other
big-name players.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors from a local health club were said to be paying the
players $2,000 to $10,000 apiece, but there was some concern about
whether the payment might interfere with contract clauses regarding
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a decent group, but not all the names I wanted,''
said Kenny Smith, the former Rockets point guard, who helped
organize the event. ``I tried to get Mike,'' he said, referring to
Michael Jordan. ``But, you know, that's like trying to get the
President these days.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 240 players gathered here to proclaim their
solidarity in a charged, free-wheeling meeting that one participant
described as more pep rally than open discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them to be united, but I'd also like to think we
both feel a need to get the process moving,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan showed up here, standing on a podium with Shaquille
O'Neal, Karl Malone, Scottie Pippen and Robinson, among others.
There were some differences in opinion: for example, two
participants in the meeting said that when John Stockton said it
might be worthwhile to discuss accepting a lesser percentage of
revenue from the owners, he was drowned out by more militant
players. Yet the 240 voted unanimously not to accept a hard salary
cap, a device the owners want to install to put a ceiling on
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have alternated proposals about a luxury tax on
clubs that pay high salaries, but they have been so far apart that
neither side has even indicated that a tax system may be the
mechanism upon which they can forge a new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Given the posturing on Thursday, it remains to be seen what
Hunter and Granik can agree on over the weekend that could possibly
speed up negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Only one certainty emerged: In what would have been the end of
their third week of training camp, the players left Las Vegas with
their careers and salaries still in limbo.

WHERE DOES MONEY FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM GO?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton and the Congress reached their Oct. 15
budget compromise _ which added $1 billion for weapons to defend
the United States from an enemy missile-attack _ they did not
mention a crucial fact: the Pentagon has no idea how to spend the
extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they underscore the little-known fact that the Defense
Department has been quietly spending over $3 billion a year on this
program for each of the past 14 years _ $45.1 billion, in all _ and
has made no notable headway towards being able to shoot down a
single ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most promising anti-missile weapon on the drawing
boards today _ the THAAD (for Theater High-Altitude Area Defense)
system _ has failed all five of its tests, to date.
</P>
<P>
   Top Pentagon officials tried to tell Congress some of this news
two weeks before the budget settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In Oct. 2 hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
when Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre found himself coming
under heavy criticism by Republican Senators for going too slow on
anti-missile defenses, he replied, ``You couldn't give us more
money to accelerate that, because it just couldn't go any faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieut. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the Pentagon's
ballistic-missile-defense office, agreed: ``There really is nothing
we can do with additional money that we haven't already
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, an extra $1 billion was tacked on to the program _
nearly a 30 percent boost beyond its existing $3.7 billion budget _
as part of a trade-off for giving Clinton the $1 billion he wanted
to hire more school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there were an act of throwing money, this is it,''
sighed a Senate staff member who saw the negotiations up close.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the increase, the amount that the Pentagon has
quietly been spending on missile-defenses is about the same as the
sum President Reagan spent each year on his high-profile Strategic
Defense Initiative, widely known as ``star wars.'' Then and now,
all the money has yielded no tangible success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely without human precedent that such a large
amount of money has just vanished into thin air,'' marvelled John
Pike, a weapons specialist at the Federation of American Scientists
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The 0-for-5 test-record of the THAAD system _ unable to knock
down even the most straightforward incoming target out on the New
Mexico test range _ has raised even critics' eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rather amazed they've gone so long without hitting
anything,'' said Pike, a long-time skeptic of missile defense.
``Maybe Mother Nature's trying to tell us something. Maybe this is
a lot more difficult than it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's missile-defense program is far less ambitious than Star
Wars. Reagan's vision was to make nuclear weapons obsolete by
putting up a ``peace shield,'' as he called it _ radars, sensors,
and anti-missile missiles on the ground and in outer space, to
track and shoot down incoming enemy missiles, including the Soviet
Union's vast arsenal of ICBMs, long before they reach the American
skies.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush kept up the program, even modestly increasing its
budget, though enthusiasm sagged in 1991, after the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was revived that same year, though in a different
guise, with the Gulf War. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired several
Soviet-built Scud missiles during that war, and some _ though not
nearly as many as was first thought _ were shot down by America's
Patriot air-defense system. It seemed for a moment that
anti-missile missiles might be practical after all.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton came into office, he shifted the
program's resources _ drastically cutting the amount for defending
American cities (which many thought infeasible anyway) and
drastically boosting the amount for defending soldiers on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   However, a hard core of Republicans held on to Reagan's vision,
and when they recaptured the Congress after the 1992 elections,
pushed to get back at least a glimmer of it.
</P>
<P>
   Starting last year, Congress added more money for
missile-defenses _ Clinton had let its budget slip under $3 billion
two years in a row _ and devoted a higher percentage of the money
to defending the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, it passed the American Missile Protection Act, which
declares, ``It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as
soon as technologically possible, an effective National Missile
Defense system capable of defending the United States against a
limited ballistic-missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody any longer claims it possible to defend against a
large-scale attack launched by a nuclear superpower like Russia.
The object is to prevent a country armed with a small number of
long-range missiles _ like North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, or maybe
some rogue terrorist group _ from holding millions of Americans
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile system, as the Pentagon is planning it, would
work as follows. Early-warning radars pick up signs of an attack.
Advanced radars, based on the ground and in outer space, calculate
the attack's trajectory and feed the data to a command center,
which aims and fires the anti-missile missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, which allows the United States to field 100 such missiles
at a site in North Dakota. (The Russians are also allowed one site
of 100 missiles.)
</P>
<P>
   Some enthusiasts would like to put another 100 missiles in
Alaska, which would upset the ABM Treaty, but that has long been an
ulterior aim. Sen. Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said at the Oct. 2 hearing that the treaty
``has outlived its usefulness.'' He and others also claimed it
``has no legal standing'' since the dissolution of its
co-signateur, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Defense politics in Congress have shifted so far rightward that
even critics of anti-missile systems cannot afford to be opposed to
the system in principle, as they could a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' line _ reflected in the Clinton administration's
policy _ is called ``3 + 3.'' The idea, as outlined by Defense
Secretary William Cohen, is that the Pentagon continues developing
these weapons for three years _ about the time a test program will
take. If all goes well, they will have reached the point where an
actual system could be deployed in another three years _ if it is
deemed cost-effective and if there is a threat. This schedule is
prudent, Cohen has said, because the Central Intelligence Agency
can tell another country is about to field an ICBM at least three
years ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have assailed this logic, noting that last
August, when North Korea launched a three-stage rocket, the CIA had
to confess it was surprised about that third stage. While officials
say the rocket was probably meant to launch satellites, it could
theoretically pack a warhead some day _ and the third stage could
give it the range to strike U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats privately say the proper response to such
concerns _ but one that almost nobody is making publicly, for fear
of coming off as ``soft on defense'' _ is that there may not be
anything we can do about it. ABMs have been deemed theoretically
feasible since 1946, yet in the real world, nobody has pulled off
even its simplest elements. And so, as was true during the darkest
days of the Cold War, the United States might have to rely for
peace on diplomacy and deterrence _ the threat of devastating
retaliation to anyone who dares launch a nuclear attack.

 &HT;    Flood: waters are receding, cleanup continues
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Floodwaters topped out and began receding across
the Texas coast Friday, while relief agencies tried to avert the
so-called ``second disaster'' that often follows natural
catastrophes _ a flood of well-meaning but unneeded donations.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992: people
sent prom dresses and winter clothes. And after the August flood in
Del Rio: tons of unsorted clothes and a rail car of orange juice
arrived out of nowhere, tying up volunteers and resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the relief community, they call the donations STUFF _
Senseless Trash Useless to Frantic Folks, said David Tomkins, the
Texas Department of Public Safety's donations management
coordinator. ``In a typical scenario when you have a disaster,
everyone starts to hold drives, and you get a second disaster,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His advice: ``Deal with an organization that does this all the
time. Don't just think that you know what (flood victims) need.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Salvation Army sent out a press release _ titled
``No mas!'' _ asking people to stop sending clothing. The agency,
which has set up seven distribution centers throughout the
flood-ravaged counties, said it needs canned food, personal and
household items, and money.

   In Cuero, where the Guadalupe River was still 10 feet above
flood stage Friday after inundating most of the town, the Salvation
Army's first load of food was gone in a few hours. Another truck is
expected to arrive this afternoon. Jo Schweikhard Moss, spokeswoman
for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said people who want to
volunteer during the clean-up effort should also go through a
relief agency rather than simply showing up _ since local hotel
rooms are often needed by families left homeless by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   Relief groups say money is still the best way to help. Cash
donations help the agencies buy food and supplies and give
residents vouchers that they can use at local stores _ which helps
keep the local economy afloat during a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   The state's damage estimate stood at about $450 million _ and
that's just from seven of 25 counties in the disaster area. About
1,500 people slept in shelters across the region Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials began walking
door-to-door informing Austin flood victims of assistance programs.
Over the next several weeks, FEMA ``reservists'' such as Horace
Reibe and George Gibson will comb streets in the affected counties.
</P>
<P>
   When 13 inches of water flooded her house on Creekbend near
Williamson Creek in Southeast Austin, Grace Rodriguez said she
called FEMA to ask about low-interest federal loans for disaster
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Del Rio,'' she said. ``My in-laws lost everything (in
the August flood). . .Their home was right on the banks of the San
Felipe Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said she and her husband were at a hospital visiting a
friend Saturday, and their oldest daughter, Sandy, took her three
sisters to safety. The water knocked down walls and destroyed
everything inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``No life was taken,'' she said. ``That's the best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of counties under a state disaster declaration
jumped to 25 when Gov. George W. Bush added Harris, Fort Bend,
Montgomery, Waller and Austin counties. Travis, Hays, Bastrop and
Caldwell counties are also within the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of flood-related deaths increased to 29 when
authorities added John Hamilton Jr., 24, of Baton Rouge, La., who
died when the car he was riding in washed off a flooded road in
Uvalde County on Sunday. A couple from Lockhart remained missing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cuero remained without water, and the Texas National Guard
prepared to deliver 19,000 liters of bottled water to the town.
With up to 1,000 people homeless from the flooding, the federal
government was preparing to deliver manufactured homes to serve as
temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bass of the Salvation Army, who is serving as the state's
disaster shelter coordinator, said the number of people in shelters
in Cuero dropped from 1,050 Wednesday to 350 Friday. Much of the
reduction came from people moving in with family and friends, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen Colorado River crested and began receding in most
areas. The river reached record levels in Smithville, La Grange,
Columbus and Wharton, wiping out previous records set during the
December 1991 flood.
</P>
<P>
   In Wharton, where half of the city was evacuated, the river
crested at 48.7 feet on Friday and was expected to remain at or
near its projected crest into the weekend, said Bill McCann,
spokesman for the Lower Colorado River Authority. The river was
expected to crest below flood stage at Bay City, but low-lying
areas between Wharton and the Gulf of Mexico are still threatened,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guadalupe River was taking longer to recede, remaining 10 or
more feet above flood stage in Cuero and Gonzales, said Judy
Gardner, spokeswoman for the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.
``These communities probably won't see the river drop at least
until Monday, maybe longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pagano, chief of the FEMA's community mitigation programs
branch, said officials have encountered an alarming number of
people who lived within a 100-year flood plain but did not have
flood insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy flood insurance, that's the message,'' Pagano said. ``If
you're in the flood plain, you're gambling if you don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tropical disturbance has brought rain and wind to
the Gulf, but it isn't expected to affect Texas' weather, said
Dennis Cook, a forecaster at the National Weather Service.
</P>

OLYMPIAN MOCEANU'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT ON DAUGHTER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST
PARENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Camilia Moceanu and her husband Dumitru said Friday they are not
the poster parents for the victimization of teen-age athletes that
many have portrayed them to be.
</P>
<P>
   In her first interview since her daughter Dominique Moceanu
(pronounced MO-cee-ah-nu) ran away from home Sunday, Camilia
Moceanu said Friday the Olympic gold-medalist is being a typical
``rebel teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can you push?'' said Camilia Moceanu, who received a
court order to stay away from her daughter Tuesday, one day after
her 37th birthday. ``One year? Two years? Three years? Ten years? I
cannot push that long. If you don't want to do it (gymnastics),
don't do it. I am tired of pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's saying she wants to go to the 2000 Olympics,''
Camelia Moceanu said. ``Is anybody forcing her? I told her, `If you
don't want to go to the Olympics, don't go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus, clearly weary of being in the spotlight all week
after their daughter left home, said they have always maintained a
good relationship with Dominique and have not squandered her
fortune and childhood as the young gymnast has claimed. Dominique,
17, filed a lawsuit Monday asking to be a declared a legal adult,
claiming the money she has earned as a professional since age 10 is
all but gone. She turns 18 on Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus filed motions in court Friday to delay a scheduled
Nov. 11 hearing on Dominque's quest for adult status, dissolve the
temporary restraining order keeping them from Dominique, dismiss
her lawsuit, and to bring her back home.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing for these motions has been scheduled for Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Dominique) was asked before (she ran away) if she missed
her childhood, and she said, `I don't, what I have experienced and
the opportunities I have had other children don't have,' '' Camelia
Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu, 44, said Dominique's trust fund has been used
to build a 70,000-square-foot gym at 6120 Louetta in Spring that
opened last year, a gym that his daughter wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working at Interstate Ford where I was a manager, I
don't need a gym,'' said Moceanu, a former car dealer. ``It was for
her and other children to give them the best place. I survived
without having a gym.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nadia was saying, `At 15 I had a doll, at 15 she (Dominique)
has a gym,' '' said Camelia Moceanu, referring to a comment Gold
medalist Nadia Comaneci has made.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggins, 32, a family friend who helped with construction
of the gym and who helped Dominique leave home, said the gym cost
about $4 million. Dumitru Moceanu scoffed at that figure, but
declined to say how much it cost. He said the gym is surviving
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, who was with Dominique Friday at an undisclosed
location, said her lawyers advised her to not respond to her
parents' statements for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about `He said, she said,' '' Huggins said. ``It's
about Dom (Dominique) trying to live her life on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus, Romanian immigrants, said they both competed for
the Romanian national gymnastics team as youths, but not in the
Olympics. They declined to discuss how they met or when they
emigrated to America.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique was born in Los Angeles in 1981, and the family moved
to the Houston area in 1990 so Dominique could train with famed
trainer Bela Karolyi, who coached Comaneci in Romania and later
several top gymnasts, including Mary Lou Retton, in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu disputed her daughter's contention that her
parents only talk to her about gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with her so many times in the ice cream store where
she has her poster there,'' Camelia Moceanu said, referring to
Dominque's statement to the Chronicle on Tuesday of ``Can't we go
out for ice cream?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday we get all the gymnasts and go there to eat ice
cream,'' Camelia Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru said he and his wife have sacrificed tremendously for
Dominique's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to move to another state for her. We said, `OK, sell
the business, move to another state, start a new business,' ''
Dumitru Moceanu said. ``It's not easy. All this costs a lot of
money. We have sacrificed all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu said Dominique was ``smiling from ear to ear''
on her 17th birthday when her parents traded in Dominique's
Mercedes for a Mustang convertible.
</P>
<P>
   The parents said they make the payments on their daughter's car,
but Dominique has said her parents bought cars for themselves
outright.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus also disputed their daughter's contention they have
been selling a line of gymnastics clothing using Dominique's name
without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with her? She was wearing the clothes with her
name on it, how she doesn't know?'' Camelia Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She designed them,'' Dumitru Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said she had been considering taking legal action for
some time, but was pushed to finally do so after her father said
Saturday he would fire her coach since January, Luminita Miscenco,
whom Dominique credits with reviving her career. Dominique said her
father wanted to fire Miscenco because the coach was helping her
understand her financial predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu repeated his earlier contention that the coach
encouraged his daughter to leave home and that he wanted for fire
her because she was demanding more money and a house.
</P>
<P>
   Dominque is scheduled to give her deposition on Tuesday, at
which time she is to bring her diaries and any items related to
Miscenco, Huggins and Jeff Pudlo, another coach.
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu said the only change she had noticed in
Dominique's behavior was, ``in the last month, she was always
telling me she was tired, we didn't want to interfere too much.''
</P>
<P>
   They said Dominique became slightly withdrawn because she was
concentrating on school.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said Tuesday that she still loves her parents and
hopes this lawsuit can bring the family ``closer than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said he is skeptical that this can bring the
family closer, but said he loves his daughter and wants her back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents we don't believe we did anything ever that we did
not think to be in her best interest,'' Camelia Moceanu said. ``If
I have to give my life for her, I will. Even if we criticize her
sometimes or spanked her sometimes when she was young, it was for
her own good.'' &QL;

IN COLORADO RESORT FIRES, CULPRITS DEFY EASY LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: U.K., Colo., Minn., Ore., Wash., Wis.)  (js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. with EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Years before someone took responsibility for
torching a Colorado ski resort this week in the name of the Earth
Liberation Front, the name was used by radical saboteurs who say
they strike to protect animals and wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The name has been used for several years by vandals in the
United Kingdom to claim credit for actions as diverse as sabotaging
construction equipment and uprooting genetically modified beets.
Two years ago near Eugene, Ore., the name was spray-painted at the
scene when someone damaged trucks at a forest service ranger
station; a few days later another ranger station in the area was
set afire.
</P>
<P>
   But while the movement's adherents have claimed credit for many
crimes, it is not clear whether the Earth Liberation Front is truly
an organization an ideological umbrella for unrelated extremists or
a front for saboteurs from other, more public organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Its methods seem to have evolved from the militant animal-rights
movement's tactics against animal experimentation, fur production,
hunting and meat production.
</P>
<P>
   The people claiming responsibility in Vail, Colo., for
committing the most expensive act of eco-terrorism in the nation's
history ``on behalf of the lynx'' are using a name that is closely
associated with the much more well-known Animal Liberation Front
(ALF), which began in England in the mid-70s and has a national
press office in Minnesota. In what law enforcement officials said
was almost certainly arson, gasoline was used to set several
buildings and chair lifts ablaze at Vail Resorts atop Vail
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the two groups appear on the same Web site for
publicity and on joint news releases claiming responsibility for
setting fires at two federal animal research stations in Olympia,
Wash., in June and for raiding a research fur farm near Madison,
Wis. in July.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Animal Liberation Front, the Earth Liberation
Front has no known spokesperson. It appears to have started as a
way of distancing extreme acts like vandalism from other forms of
civil disobedience sometimes adopted by radical environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Fedor, a spokeswoman for the Animal Liberation Front in
Osseo, Minn., said that the Earth Liberation Front isn't planning
to organize a press office or headquarters. ``They're not going to
jeopardize their actions by coming out,'' she said. ``They can't be
active if they're in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The Animal Liberation Front has a press office to explain its
actions, she said, and it is answering queries about the Earth
Liberation Front ``because the goals of the organizations are the
same: the end of animal suffering. As long as they meet the
guidelines of not hurting anyone, having a strict non-violent
policy of not hurting any humans or animals, we support what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Department of Justice called the ALF ``a
loose configuration of small, autonomous `cells,' with no
centralized command structure. It is also believed that there are
no formal membership requirements beyond the willingness to inflict
damage upon an animal enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ELF was unknown in this country at the time, much
the same description would appear to fit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The ELF name showed up in England in about 1992, a time when
Earth First! was expanding there. Conceived as a way to separate
sabotage actions from less secretive activities, the English ELF
quickly allied itself with the ALF operations there, according to
various accounts published by sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Judi Bari, an American Earth First! leader, noted in
one of the group's publications that while England's Earth First!
group ``may sympathize with the activities of ELF, they do not
engage in them. If we are serious about our movement in the U.S.,
we will do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil disobedience and sabotage are both powerful tactics in
our movement,'' wrote Ms. Bari, who had been injured a few years
earlier in an unexplained explosion of a bomb in her car and later
died of cancer. ``For the survival of both, it's time to leave the
night work to the elves in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   But Earth First!, the Eureka, Ore.-based radical environmental
group whose members have chained themselves to trees to block
loggers, denies any connection to the other group. Theresa Kintz,
an editor of the journal, said the two groups probably share ``a
philosophy of defense of the wild.'' ``There are a lot of
individuals trying to save the wild,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Animal Liberation Frontline, the online newsletter of the
North American ALF Supporters Group, one article says that the ELF
``is now active in 10 to 15 countries, with some daring actions
taking place in the Netherlands, Finland, Poland, and now Canada
and the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest worry for security services will be when the earth
and animal liberation movements get together,'' it said. ``Well,
they have _ world, watch out, 'cause we've got a big planet to
save, plus millions of species depending on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web pages contain information on making devices for
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Arnold, the vice president of the Center for the Defense of
Free Enterprise, a defender of property rights and a critic of
environmentalists who specialize in cataloguing eco-terrorism, says
the groups are closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing before the Crime Subcommittee of the House
Judiciary Committee last summer, Arnold said that ``I've been able
to determine that certain criminal Earth Firsters, Earth Liberation
Front members, and Animal Liberation Front members are, in fact,
the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 report to Congress on animal-rights extremism, the
U.S. Justice Department said that the ``ALF is believed to have a
very loosely organized membership of 100 or fewer militant
activists who are willing to inflict large-scale damage or
destruction on behalf of their cause. All extremist animal-rights
groups are believed to be associated with each other by leadership,
membership or both.''
</P>
<P>
   But while England's movement may have inspired the one in this
country, that report found ``no evidence that would suggest that
there are any operational, logistical, or financial connections
between ALF or other groups in the U.K. (or other countries) and
their counterparts in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Other radical groups said the Earth Liberation Front is a fairly
new movement which they know little about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't even know where to reach them,'' said Cain Allen,
a member of the Liberation Collective in Portland, Ore. He said the
Liberation Collective, which is aligned with animal-rights groups
and labor-rights groups, does not speak for the ELF but dispenses
communiques it receives from the group and from others.
</P>
<P>
   The first mention of the ELF the Liberation Collective received,
Allen said, was in a faxed release last fall. In it, both the
Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front claimed
responsibility for a fire in Oregon that caused $450,000 in damages
to a holding corral where 488 wild horses and 51 burros captured by
the Bureau of Land Management were scheduled to be sold, possibly
for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream environmental organizations outspokenly denounce
anyone who takes the law into their own hands, saying that extreme
and illegal actions undermine the widespread support for sound
environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undermining the rule of law cannot possibly advance the cause
of environmentalism, '' said Fred Krupp, the head of the
Environmental Defense Fund. ``Regardless of what one's view of the
lynx is, or the expansion, the arson at Vail is an outrage.''

A MELTING POT OF LANGUAGES FOR EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By K. ALEASE DILDAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Que would happen if, wenn Du open your computerzo finde eine
message in esta lingua? No es Englando, no est Germano, no este
Espana, no est keine known lingua aber Du Understande!''
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't some kind of garbled translation program. It's a
message in Europanto, a linguistic amalgam created by Diego Marani,
a translator for the European Council of Ministers in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Marani figured that if Europe could come up with a single
currency, why not a single language? European Union members
frequently communicate in English even though it is not the native
language of most members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intended to give voice to the frustrations of the vast
majority of people who are forced to use English,'' Marani said,
``even though their command of the language is not very good.'' So
he wants to ``europantize'' English. After all, he notes, ``there
are many words such as blitzkrieg, pizza and leitmotif that
everybody understands.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Italy, Marani conceived Europanto while observing
the language wars in Belgium and listening to the polyglots at the
Council of Ministers in Brussels struggling to find a common tongue
for casual hallway encounters. Drawing from Italian, French, Dutch
and English _ languages he speaks fluently _ Marani began writing
lessons in Europanto for an internal publication of the council. An
officer of the council passed the publication to the editor of a
Belgian weekly, Le Soir Illustre. The paper began publishing
Marani's lessons in Europanto in December 1996, with the
double-edged slogan, ``Absurd times call for absurd solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons soon became a cult hit, offering useful tips that
more traditional language courses might overlook. In the lesson,
``Aan der diskoteka,'' Euro and Eura, the Dick and Jane of
Europanto, meet at a nightclub. ``Wat esse teine supportebra
size?'' Euro asks. To which Eura might counter with, ``Wat make? Me
palpe el behind.'' (What are you doing? Keep your hands to
yourself.)
</P>
<P>
   Belgium is a logical birthplace for a common tongue. Sandwiched
between the Netherlands and France, Belgium claims both country's
languages. The result is that Dutch-speakers have been waging a
bitter war of words with their French-speaking compatriots for
centuries. Enter a restaurant, address the maitre d'hotel in the
wrong language, and you may find yourself dining on cold pommes
frites. ``The language issue in Belgium is a very stupid one,''
says Marani, who has lived in Brussels for 10 years. ``It is the
first thing a foreigner notices.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for a single lingua franca to remedy the punishment
for the Tower of Babel goes back centuries. As the semiotician
Umberto Eco has explained, Irish grammarians argued in a
seventh-century document that Gaelic overcame the confusion of
Babel. ``All that was best in each language, all there was that was
grand and beautiful, was cut out and retained in Irish,'' he writes
of their work in his new book, ``Serendipities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more modern examples, like Esperanto. (Or, for that
matter, Frenglish, Spanglish or Englitalian). Invented in 1887 by
L.L. Zamenhof, who lived in Warsaw, Esperanto never caught on,
although it still has loyal speakers. Not surprisingly, the World
Esperanto Association in Rotterdam does not consider Europanto an
alternative to the century-old language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no definite structure, it's not a language,'' Nikolas
Rasic, a conference secretary, said of Marani's invention. ``I am a
professional linguist. What is he? A clerk?'' (Indeed, Marani said
that he receives ``letters from angry Esperantists,'' and added,
``They think I am plotting against them, but they are many and I am
only one.'') But who knows? Over time, perhaps recalcitrant
Esperantists may come around. Even Rasic conceded: ``I read it and
I thought it was funny. The purpose of Esperanto is to bring the
world together. If some other language can do it, OK''
</P>
<P>
   Rasic is right about Europanto's grammatical structure; there is
none. ``I see it instinctively, I feel the grammar inside of me,''
Marani says. ``It's like playing the guitar or painting a
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problem of getting other people to ``feel'' the
grammar, the French publisher Fayard plans a January release for
``Las Adventuras des Inspector Cabillot,'' stories in Europanto
about a bumbling detective at the fictional European Agency of
Strange Matters. Il Minotauro, an Italian publisher, will also
publish Cabillot stories under the title ``Adelanto mit
Europanto.''
</P>
<P>
   Marani says he has already received hundreds of communications
from Europanto fans around the globe. He adds that the Swiss and
Canadians, with their own linguistically divided countries, show
particular interest.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Marani takes a lighthearted approach to his creation.
But in less humble moments he declares that Europanto is a
harbinger of the future of English in the new common Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not his grandiose prediction is true, few could argue
with his critical assessment: ``Language in Europe is at a critical
juncture. It is going to be a mess.''

RUELAS EYES TITLE SHOT, FACES BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gabriel Ruelas of Sylmar, Calif., could be a step away from
another title shot.
</P>
<P>
   If John Brown's performance against Angel Manfredy last month is
any indication, it's a challenging step.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas (45-4, with 23 knockouts) and Brown (18-5, 9) will meet
on the undercard of the David Reid-James Coker super welterweight
fight tonight in Atlantic City, N.J., with the winner likely to
face the winner of the Dec. 19 fight between Manfredy and WBC super
featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas was scheduled to fight James Leija, from whom he took the
WBC title in 1994. However, Brown was called in when Leija injured
his ribs in training.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, an aggressive, skillful boxer with limited power, lost a
unanimous but close decision to Manfredy on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy John took Leija's place,'' Ruelas said. ``Leija
likes to move around and try to outbox people, but John comes right
after you.... I don't like chasing after a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown, who is from Atlantic City, wants redemption in
the wake of the Manfredy disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually really good timing for John,'' said David
Appollonia, Brown's manager. ``He's been chomping at the bit to get
another opportunity because of the resentment over his last
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid (10-0, 7 KOs), America's only Olympic champion in 1996, and
Coker (19-0, 12) are both undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Robert Garcia of Oxnard will defend his IBF
junior lightweight title against Ramon Ledon.
</P>
<P>
   The card will be televised live on HBO.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With fans chanting for him to remain with the
Yankees, Bernie Williams stood on a podium at City Hall Friday and
said, ``I think I've got a chance to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared. Then Williams, who is expected to file for
free agency shortly, motioned to George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner who was sitting nearby, and said, ``But you've got
to talk to this guy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is right in trying to deflect some of the tension
surrounding the Yankees' most notable decision of this off-season,
for if the team is to re-sign its cleanup hitter, both Williams and
the Yankees will have to bend substantially _ and that seems
unlikely. The Yankees appear far more likely to re-sign third
baseman Scott Brosius, another free agent who was the most valuable
player of this year's World Series, and work out a deal with
pitcher David Cone. But outfielder Tim Raines and catcher Joe
Girardi may well be playing somewhere else next season.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other players eligible for free agency, Williams must
file for that privilege by midnight Nov. 5. He is the American
League batting champion, a switch-hitting center fielder, and he is
expected to command numerous offers, from the Arizona Diamondbacks
and perhaps the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, Los Angeles
Dodgers and Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made $8.25 million in 1998, and the Yankees are
expected to make him an offer somewhere in the range of five years
for $10 million per season. But that probably will be far less, in
total dollars, than what Williams can get elsewhere; Williams would
have to be willing to take less to stay with the Yankees. Given
that Williams still feels slighted by past negotiations with the
Yankees and that his agent, Scott Boras, usually gets top dollar,
the chances of Williams being willing to make financial concessions
or the Yankees making an offer that is in line with other offers
seems improbable.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams rejects the Yankees' first offer outright, look for
the Yankees to acquire another center fielder very quickly. They
could explore a trade for the likes of Anaheim's Jim Edmonds or Ray
Lankford of the St. Louis Cardinals, or they could sign a free
agent, such as Brian Jordan. They could also determine to give
Ricky Ledee a shot at playing center field.
</P>
<P>
   After filing, Williams and the other free agents can talk to
other teams about their interest, but not specifically about money,
until Nov. 6. Then the bidding begins.
</P>
<P>
   Several matters are pending in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brosius can file for free agency, but the Yankees are resolved
to re-signing him and Brosius wants to come back. ``If they want me
back, they've got a pretty good chance of getting me,'' Brosius
said Friday in the Yankees' clubhouse before the parade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because Cone pitched 200 innings, he has the option of
accepting a one-year, $5.5 million contract from the Yankees by
next Wednesday at midnight. Cone, who won 20 games, may want to
parlay his success this summer into more dollars or some sort of an
extension, but those talks must move fast. ``I'm hoping to get
something done quickly,'' Cone said Friday. If Cone declines his
option, he can become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raines' tenure with the Yankees is probably over. The team
already has outfielders Chad Curtis and Paul O'Neill under
contract, and the late-season emergence of Shane Spencer and Ledee
virtually insures that duo will be in the majors next season; in
addition, the Yankees may retain Darryl Strawberry. Raines, who is
39, must file for free agency by Nov. 5
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees have eight more days to announce whether they are
declining a $3.4 million option for Girardi. But it is apparent,
with Jorge Posada ready to catch full time, that the Yankees will
choose to buy out the option for $400,000. The Yankees may try to
work out another, more inexpensive contract to keep Girardi, a
veteran who is well-liked and respected. Girardi, however,
indicated that as hard as it would be to leave the Yankees, his
preference still is to play every day for somebody. The Detroit
Tigers and Orioles and Chicago Cubs may all put in bids for him.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees have eight more days to determine whether they
will exercise the $2.5 million option on the contract of Darryl
Strawberry. This would be a cut-and-dried decision under normal
circumstances: Strawberry is an older, incapacitated player because
of his colon cancer and there are no guarantees he will ever play
again. But Steinbrenner has a liking for Strawberry, a particular
benevolence, and it figures that some arrangements will be made for
Strawberry to stay with the organization, whether through
renegotiation or other avenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Knoblauch, the second-baseman acquired from the
Minnesota Twins in February, technically has the right to demand a
trade before Nov. 6, and if he were to do so, the Yankees would
have to deal him by March 15 or allow him to depart as a free
agent. But others in the organization say Knoblauch's agents long
ago arranged the framework for a two-year, $18 million extension to
the three remaining years on Knoblauch's current contract, a deal
that presumably will be announced shortly. ``I'm coming back, if
they want me,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, is expected to sign a two-year
extension shortly, a deal that would keep him tied to the team
through the year 2001. Others in the organization say Torre,
already signed for next year at about $1.3 million, will get a
raise that will push his salary near $2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Cashman, the first-year general manager who worked under
a one-year contract (for about $250,000), likely will get an
extension from Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Williams departs or not, the Yankees will be the
favorites to repeat as the champions of the American League East.
The shortstop Derek Jeter is a rising star, and the core of the
pitching staff will remain intact, with David Wells, Orlando
Hernandez, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera, Hideki Irabu, Ramiro
Mendoza, Graeme Lloyd, Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Darren Holmes
all tied to the team through next year. With the ascension of
Hernandez, Ledee and Spencer to the big leagues, the farm system is
somewhat dry in Class AAA and AA, but very deep in Class A. The
Yankees' immediate and long-term future appears secure.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the Yankees was interested in discussing the future
Friday, as they milled around their clubhouse, shaking hands with
and hugging Darryl Strawberry and signing a last round of
autographs for one another before the parade. Shane Spencer picked
up a bottle of champagne and found a spot to add his signature to a
group of names that won't all be together next year.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Probably, very few federal judges telephone
professional wrestling lines for updates on the likes of Rowdy
Roddy and Macho Man.
</P>
<P>
   But federal judges in Pennsylvania have been poring over the
observations of Mark Madden, an irrepressible pro-wrestling
commentator here who acknowledges that the essays he writes for
callers to his 900-number are often sarcastic or even fictitious.
``Outrageous trash talk,'' he calls his musings, for which callers
pay $1.69 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But is outrageous trash talk journalism in the eyes of the law?
For two years, federal courts have been considering the question in
a case that puts Madden at the center of a landmark argument over
First Amendment rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose when Madden, in a lawsuit involving the two
biggest wrestling promotion companies in the United States, refused
to name the people who had given him information for insults he
delivered on his toll line.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was a journalist entitled to keep his sources
confidential, Madden thus probably became the first 900-number
reporter to go to the mat for his sources.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts say the case raises an important issue as the
line between traditional news and entertainment is blurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who decides whether somebody is an entertainer and not a
reporter?'' said Martin Garbus, an expert on media law, who said
that First Amendment lawyers had been watching the case.
</P>
<P>
   To those who may consider the case a goofy offshoot of
entertainment in which it is sometimes hard to tell truth from
fiction, Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert, points out, ``Many
of the great cases involved under the Bill of Rights have been
pressed where what is involved seemed silly.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal courts have ruled over the years that journalists
have a privilege to protect sources in some circumstances. But the
courts have not defined what a journalist is.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a federal district court here said that Madden was a
journalist with a right to remain mum because he gathered
information with the ``intent to disseminate'' it. In August, a
three-judge federal appeals panel disagreed, saying he was an
entertainer, ``disseminating hype, not news.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden's lawyers asked the full 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, in Philadelphia, to review the decision, saying the
appeals panel had created a new constitutional rule that evaluated
the content of speech to determine whether Madden was entitled to
First Amendment protection. And that, they said, was a dangerous
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to decide soon whether it will review the
appeals panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, 37 and a native of Pittsburgh, was for years a sports
writer and editor at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He now writes a
weekly column for the newspaper and is also host of a pregame radio
program for the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team and of a daily
sports talk show on WTAE-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is a sideline. He testified that he was paid $350 a
week by World Championship Wrestling, which owns and operates the
line.
</P>
<P>
   In his commentaries, he offers what he admits are ``gratuitous
plugs'' for World Championship Wrestling, known as the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   Madden testified that he submitted his 900-number scripts for
approval by WCW executives, and that they then got a performance
for their money.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that the WCW's archrival, the World Wrestling
Federation, was failing financially. The two wrestling promoters
compete fiercely for television ratings, and the WWF says the WCW
will do anything to steal its fans.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF and the WCW, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting
Systems, have sued each other, claiming unfair competition and
seeking millions of dollars in damages. It was in that legal fight
that Madden was subpoenaed and asked in a deposition to provide,
for example, the names of sources for his insults to WWF owner
Vincent McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry S. McDevitt, a WWF lawyer, said that if Madden did not
name his sources, he would seek to have him cited for contempt of
court.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against the WCW accuses its executives of using
Madden's 900-number reports as ``one of the principal conduits'' to
distribute disparaging information about the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   The WCW's lawyers have acknowledged that some of Madden's
statements ``blend factual reporting with his own style of
satirical editorial commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Madden was vague in drawing the line between
journalism and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked, for example, if he had ever met wrestling fans who
had called the 900 number and, if so, what their view of his
reliability had been.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he testified, he had met people who listened to his
900-number reports. And what they told him, according to his
testimony, showed that they viewed him just the way many people
view journalists today. ``These people,'' he testified, ``never
once treated the matters I spoke about as reality.''

N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL DEBATE TAKES HARSH TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first debate in the campaign for New York state
attorney general quickly turned nasty Friday as Republican
incumbent Dennis Vacco repeatedly called his Democratic challenger,
Eliot Spitzer, a liar and a lawbreaker, while Spitzer swung back by
raising questions about Vacco's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is somewhat ironic that the very laws you seek to
enforce you are currently in violation of,'' Vacco said, accusing
Spitzer of failing to properly notify the state about his use of
eight cooperative apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral for
a loan he took out to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general read from a document that he said was
signed by Spitzer's father, Bernard, a wealthy real-estate
developer, saying that the apartments had not been used as
collateral for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either this statement is perjurious,'' Vacco said, ``or the
source of your money is not being truthfully stated.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, however, brushed off the charges, maintaining that all
the appropriate documents had been filed. He also sought to put to
rest accusations from the Vacco campaign that Spitzer's father has
illegally contributed $4 million to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer to him is, humbug,'' Spitzer said. He said there is
a promissory note that establishes that he is spending his own
money, and he accused Vacco of waging a ``tawdry'' campaign through
news releases smearing Spitzer's father.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly trying to shift the focus, Spitzer cited a recent news
report saying that the attorney general received $37,500 in
campaign donations from subsidiaries of a car leasing company after
settling a lawsuit with the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue should be, why is the attorney general accepting
contributions from companies that have investigations pending
before the office?'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, taped at the studios of News 12 Long Island for
broadcast last night on that station and two other News 12 stations
in Westchester County and the Bronx, shed little light on these
questions. But in a race that has received minimal news coverage,
it gave both candidates the chance to outline their philosophies
about the office.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the two candidates are scheduled to meet again for a
one-hour debate to be carried live on WABC-TV in New York City and
on ABC affiliates throughout the state beginning at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer sought to portray his opponent as a captive of partisan
interests who has sullied an office that used to command more
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a race,'' Spitzer said, ``about restoring the grandeur
and majesty of an office defined by a simple principle: the
attorney general's office is supposed to be the law firm for the
people of the state of New York.'' He said he would be more
energetic and aggressive in enforcing environmental, antitrust and
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Spitzer, a former assistant district attorney
in Manhattan, said he would not abandon the office's role ``to keep
our streets safe'' _ although he acknowledged in a campaign
appearance Thursday that the attorney general plays a limited role
in combating street crime.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Vacco emphasized Friday that
he had fulfilled a pledge to redefine his office to make it more
relevant to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the attorney general's office had grown
disconnected from the people and was uninvolved in some of the most
important issues confronting New Yorkers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had stepped up prosecution of violent crimes
without neglecting other more traditional duties and cited his
efforts on behalf of patients' rights and against consumer fraud,
child pornography on the Internet and nursing-home abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates disagreed on whether the attorney general
should force General Electric Co. to clean up PCBs that were
legally dumped into the Hudson River before the cancer-causing
chemical was banned in 1977. Accusing the Republican administration
of sitting on its hands, Spitzer said he had met with GE officials
and felt confident that an agreement could be reached in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco said experts disagreed on whether the toxic sediment
in the river should be dredged. He asserted that the two
decades-old controversy should be resolved by federal environmental
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staggering past an 11th-hour snag over a jailed
American spy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat closed nine days of summitry
Friday with an intricate land-for-peace agreement, setting the
stage for immediate talks aimed at ending half a century of
bloodshed in the troubled Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the accord, which came after President Clinton
spent an extraordinary 82 hours over the course of the talks
coaxing the long-time adversaries toward peace, is an Israeli
pledge to withdraw troops from an additional 13 percent of the
occupied West Bank, and transfer it to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Palestinians pledged to launch an aggressive campaign
to root out terrorism and to end a decades-long appeal for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a U.S. initiative -- being called the Wye River
Memorandum -- the Israeli redeployments are to be conditioned upon
Palestinian actions, which will be assisted and verified with the
cooperation of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced plans to visit the Palestinian-controlled area
of Gaza in mid-December to lend support to Arafat and to spur the
next difficult, possibly final, round of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. He also pledged to ask Congress for additional
military aid to Israel and economic assistance for the Palestinians
as incentives to the implementation of Friday's accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement is designed to rebuild trust and renew hope for
peace,'' Clinton said, addressing several hundred summit
participants, members of Congress and senior White House aides
attending a formal signing ceremony in the elegant East Room. ''Now
both sides must build on that hope, carry out their commitments,
begin the difficult, but urgent journey toward a permanent
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''Salaam, shalom, peace be with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal contribution to the talks was extraordinary.
Not since 1978, when President Jimmy Carter spent 13 days holed up
with Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin -- a summit that produced a peace accord ending
three decades of Israeli-Egyptian hostilities -- has an American
president been so deeply involved in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the walnut table where Clinton, Netanyahu and Arafat
signed Friday's accord was Jordan's ailing King Hussein, a central
figure in steering nine days of summitry at the Wye River
Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore to a successful end.
Hussein had been in the country receiving cancer treatment at the
prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   His head bald, his face pale and drawn and his dark blue suit
hanging from once-strong shoulders grown gaunt from the effects of
chemotherapy, Hussein struck a moving figure at the talks, and at
the signing ceremony, as an enduring symbol of the quest for
Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We quarrel, we agree. We are friendly, we are not friendly.
But we have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or
narrow-mindedness the future of our children and their children's
children,'' Hussein said. ''There has been enough destruction.
Enough death. Enough waste. And it's time that, together, we occupy
a place beyond ourselves, our peoples that is worthy of them under
the sun, the descendants of the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's diplomatic success was also a political win for
Clinton, who has spent the past nine months struggling to step from
the shadows of scandal and assert presidential leadership in some
tangible form.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed that Friday's agreement is not a final
solution, but rather a step on the way to more difficult
negotiations ahead, he smiled broadly while basking in the glow of
an undeniable achievement of statesmanship in a peace process that
has produced far more pain and setbacks than satisfaction and
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, difficult work lies ahead, Clinton said, in the
so-called permanent status negotiations that are to begin in ten
days. He warned of the risks of increased terrorism of the sort
that nearly derailed the talks last Monday, when a Palestinian
terrorist lobbed a pair of grenades near a crowded bus stop in the
city of Beersheba, injuring 64 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''No doubt, as peace gains momentum, forces of hate, not matter
how isolated and disparate, will once again lash out,'' Clinton
said. ''The enemies of peace will seek to extract a price from both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on his own nation, however, to get behind Friday's
accord, which broke a dangerous 19-month stalemate in the
U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace process and raised hopes that Israelis
and Palestinians could meet a May 4, 1999 deadline for negotiating
a lasting end to a conflict that dates to Israel's birth in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast leaders echoed Clinton's cautious enthusiasm, Arafat
reading from a text in his native Arabic, and Netanyahu speaking
extemporaneously in fluid English.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important and happy day, a day of achievement that
we will always remember with optimism and hope,'' said Arafat.
''The peace process is going ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu hailed the accord as a balance between Israeli
security and expanding authority for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's a day when Israel and our entire region are more
secure,'' Netanyahu said. ''This has required sacrifice from both
sides, and reaching into what Lincoln called ''the better nature of
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ''means that our world today will be safer for our
children and for our neighbors' children,'' Netanyahu said. But, he
added, ''we are just at the beginning, or maybe at the middle, of
the road to a permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of negotiations, often called permanent status
talks, is intended to take up the most difficult issues remaining
between Israelis and Palestinians. Among those are the future of
Jerusalem, claimed by both, the question of a Palestinian state,
and a complicated array of economic, security and territorial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Friday's agreement, Netanyahu and Arafat had to
overcome deep-seated mutual distrust, the exhaustion of nine days
and eight nights of intensive negotiations, the pain and anger of
Monday's terrorist attack, and a last-minute fight between
Netanyahu and Clinton over convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, a former U.S. Naval intelligence officer, was found
guilty in 1987 of passing along classified information to Israel
concerning the military capabilities of Syria and Iraq. He was
sentenced to life in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Three American presidents -- Ronald Reagan, George Bush and
Clinton -- have turned down Israeli appeals for clemency for
Pollard, and the issue comes up in virtually every serious meeting
between senior U.S. and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. on Friday, after Netanyahu and Arafat had reached
agreement on the difficult issues dividing them, a dispute broke
out between the Israelis and Clinton over Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials told reporters gathered near the secluded
conference center, where the talks began on Oct. 15, that Clinton
had promised to release Pollard, a claim the White House quickly
denied.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement held the fate of the summit in question for
seven tense hours, while U.S. and Israeli diplomats worked to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have agreed to review this matter seriously, at the prime
minister's request,'' Clinton said. ''I have made no commitment as
to the outcome of the review.''

   WASHINGTON _ He was drawn and pale, left bald by repeated
courses of chemotherapy. He had no substantive inducements to offer
the Israelis or the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all the parties to the negotiations said, King
Hussein of Jordan, the longest-serving leader in the Middle East,
played a critical role in bringing the two sides together. It was
the latest and perhaps one of the final chapters in his long
history of coaxing the Arab world and Israel to accommodation if
not peace, and it cast him as conscience to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The king's ``courage, commitment, wisdom and frankly, stern
instruction at appropriate times were at the heart of this
success,'' President Clinton said at the signing ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded us of what rises above the facts, the arguments,
the legitimate interests, even the painful sacrifices involved,''
Clinton said of the Jordanian leader, who joined the talks after
finishing a round of cancer treatments at the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota last weekend. ``He was the living embodiment of the best
of our past and the brightest of our hopes for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The king, who is 62 and has ruled Jordan since 1953, had
delivered an emotional plea to the Israeli and Palestinian
delegations on Thursday evening, and repeated the same message
publicly Friday at the White House as Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, prepared to
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The king joked about the loss of his hair and eyebrows to
chemotherapy, and said that although many people have written him
off because of his illness, his morale is the best it has ever
been. He has non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and just completed the fourth
of six scheduled rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to
be there and to help in any way I can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quarrel, we agree, we are friendly, we are not friendly,
but we have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or
narrow-mindedness the future of our children or their children's
children,'' the king said, turning to face Netanyahu and Arafat.
``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste,
and it's time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our
peoples, that is worthy of them under the sun, the descendants of
the children of Abraham _ Palestinians and Israelis coming
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who witnessed the 1951 assassination of his
grandfather, King Abdullah, by a Palestinian who feared that Jordan
was about to make a separate peace with Israel, said Friday's
agreement would not bring an end to violence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that such a step as is concluded Friday will
inevitably trigger those who want to destroy life, destroy hope,
create fear in the hearts and minds of people, trigger in them
their worst instincts,'' the king said. ``Let's hope that the
overwhelming majority of us, those who are committed to the future,
those who know what responsibilities they hold now, will be able,
through steady progress and a determined joint combined effort, be
able to thwart their aims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has long played a critical role in efforts to bring
peace to the region, and was involved in each of the last several
breakthroughs. But he came to his role as peacemaker after fighting
Israel, violently expelling the Palestine Liberation Organization
from Jordan in 1970 and opposing the United States in the Persian
Gulf war. And he has had a tense relationship with Netanyahu, whom
he said two years ago seemed intent on scuttling the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left the Mayo Clinic, the king received a visit
last Friday from Ariel Sharon, the hard-line Israeli foreign
minister. Then, as negotiations bogged down earlier this week, the
king joined the talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland at several
points, both in person and by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the king stood alongside Clinton at the White House, the
two of them flanked by Netanyahu and Arafat. And even Netanyahu
paid tribute to Hussein, saying the Jordanian leader's two
appearances at the Wye Plantation negotiations ``gave us an
unforgettable and inspiring example of courage and humanity, and it
moved me deeply.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staggering past an 11th-hour snag over a jailed
American spy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat closed nine days of summitry
Friday with an intricate land-for-peace agreement, setting the
stage for immediate talks aimed at ending half a century of
bloodshed in the troubled Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the accord, which came after President Clinton
spent an extraordinary 82 hours over the course of the talks
coaxing the long-time adversaries toward peace, is an Israeli
pledge to withdraw troops from an additional 13 percent of the
occupied West Bank, and transfer it to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Palestinians pledged to launch an aggressive campaign
to root out terrorism and to end a decades-long appeal for the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a U.S. initiative -- being called the Wye River
Memorandum -- the Israeli redeployments are to be conditioned upon
Palestinian actions, which will be assisted and verified with the
cooperation of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced plans to visit the Palestinian-controlled area
of Gaza in mid-December to lend support to Arafat and to spur the
next difficult, possibly final, round of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. He also pledged to ask Congress for additional
military aid to Israel and economic assistance for the Palestinians
as incentives to the implementation of Friday's accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement is designed to rebuild trust and renew hope for
peace,'' Clinton said, addressing several hundred summit
participants, members of Congress and senior White House aides
attending a formal signing ceremony in the elegant East Room. ''Now
both sides must build on that hope, carry out their commitments,
begin the difficult, but urgent journey toward a permanent
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''Salaam, shalom, peace be with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal contribution to the talks was extraordinary.
Not since 1978, when President Jimmy Carter spent 13 days holed up
with Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin -- a summit that produced a peace accord ending
three decades of Israeli-Egyptian hostilities -- has an American
president been so deeply involved in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at the walnut table where Clinton, Netanyahu and Arafat
signed Friday's accord was Jordan's ailing King Hussein, a central
figure in steering nine days of summitry at the Wye River
Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore to a successful end.
Hussein had been in the country receiving cancer treatment at the
prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   His head bald, his face pale and drawn and his dark blue suit
hanging from once-strong shoulders grown gaunt from the effects of
chemotherapy, Hussein struck a moving figure at the talks, and at
the signing ceremony, as an enduring symbol of the quest for
Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We quarrel, we agree. We are friendly, we are not friendly.
But we have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or
narrow-mindedness the future of our children and their children's
children,'' Hussein said. ''There has been enough destruction.
Enough death. Enough waste. And it's time that, together, we occupy
a place beyond ourselves, our peoples that is worthy of them under
the sun, the descendants of the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's diplomatic success was also a political win for
Clinton, who has spent the past nine months struggling to step from
the shadows of scandal and assert presidential leadership in some
tangible form.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed that Friday's agreement is not a final
solution, but rather a step on the way to more difficult
negotiations ahead, he smiled broadly while basking in the glow of
an undeniable achievement of statesmanship in a peace process that
has produced far more pain and setbacks than satisfaction and
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, difficult work lies ahead, Clinton said, in the
so-called permanent status negotiations that are to begin in ten
days. He warned of the risks of increased terrorism of the sort
that nearly derailed the talks last Monday, when a Palestinian
terrorist lobbed a pair of grenades near a crowded bus stop in the
city of Beersheba, injuring 64 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''No doubt, as peace gains momentum, forces of hate, not matter
how isolated and disparate, will once again lash out,'' Clinton
said. ''The enemies of peace will seek to extract a price from both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on his own nation, however, to get behind Friday's
accord, which broke a dangerous 19-month stalemate in the
U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace process and raised hopes that Israelis
and Palestinians could meet a May 4, 1999 deadline for negotiating
a lasting end to a conflict that dates to Israel's birth in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast leaders echoed Clinton's cautious enthusiasm, Arafat
reading from a text in his native Arabic, and Netanyahu speaking
extemporaneously in fluid English.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important and happy day, a day of achievement that
we will always remember with optimism and hope,'' said Arafat.
''The peace process is going ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu hailed the accord as a balance between Israeli
security and expanding authority for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's a day when Israel and our entire region are more
secure,'' Netanyahu said. ''This has required sacrifice from both
sides, and reaching into what Lincoln called ''the better nature of
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ''means that our world today will be safer for our
children and for our neighbors' children,'' Netanyahu said. But, he
added, ''we are just at the beginning, or maybe at the middle, of
the road to a permanent peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of negotiations, often called permanent status
talks, is intended to take up the most difficult issues remaining
between Israelis and Palestinians. Among those are the future of
Jerusalem, claimed by both, the question of a Palestinian state,
and a complicated array of economic, security and territorial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Friday's agreement, Netanyahu and Arafat had to
overcome deep-seated mutual distrust, the exhaustion of nine days
and eight nights of intensive negotiations, the pain and anger of
Monday's terrorist attack, and a last-minute fight between
Netanyahu and Clinton over convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, a former U.S. Naval intelligence officer, was found
guilty in 1987 of passing along classified information to Israel
concerning the military capabilities of Syria and Iraq. He was
sentenced to life in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Three American presidents -- Ronald Reagan, George Bush and
Clinton -- have turned down Israeli appeals for clemency for
Pollard, and the issue comes up in virtually every serious meeting
between senior U.S. and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. on Friday, after Netanyahu and Arafat had reached
agreement on the difficult issues dividing them, a dispute broke
out between the Israelis and Clinton over Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials told reporters gathered near the secluded
conference center, where the talks began on Oct. 15, that Clinton
had promised to release Pollard, a claim the White House quickly
denied.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement held the fate of the summit in question for
seven tense hours, while U.S. and Israeli diplomats worked to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have agreed to review this matter seriously, at the prime
minister's request,'' Clinton said. ''I have made no commitment as
to the outcome of the review.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 25, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo was that it was
embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals of European
origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis, the poor and
those of Middle Eastern origin. Now, three years after an Orthodox,
Yemenite Israeli student sought to end the peace deal by
assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, here were the
representatives of that other Israel coming to terms with the
reality that Oslo had created. By Ethan Bronner. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PHOTOS-REVIEW _ Increasingly, if inconsistently,
disturbing images of the dead are finding their way into print and
on television. There are corpses without shrouds, without the
comfort of a soft focus. There are slack bodies, bloated bodies,
frozen frightened faces that make viewers turn away. In fits and
starts, the conservative reflexes that made graphic death a rarity
in newspapers in the generation after the Vietnam War are being
supplanted by a willingness to use these images, with their
powerful emotional impact. By Felicity Barringer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-REVIEW _ It would seem impossible for Genaro Arriagada
not to feel some satisfaction at the arrest in London of his
country's former military dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. As a
prominent academic in the years after Pinochet took power in Chile,
Arriagada churned out a series of critical studies on the military
and its rule. When Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to
a popular vote, Arriagada organized the coalition that campaigned
successfully for his defeat in a national referendum. By Tim
Golden. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAYS-POLITICS-REVIEW _ The struggle between defiant advocates
and those who prefer to compromise has been mirrored in other civil
rights movements, notably the one for black rights. But the gay
rights movement is distinct because it is made up of such a diverse
universe _ covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its
members share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely,
the experience of discrimination. It is not surprising, then, that
the movement as a whole has never reached a consensus about its
mission: An equal rights bill? Admission to the military? The right
to marry? To be left alone? By Adam Nagourney. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-REVIEW _ Until last week, most Americans thought of
Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and
innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who
almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.
On Monday, however, in a Washington, D.C. courtroom, the Justice
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for
personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian
schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.
By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LT.-GOVERNORS-REVIEW _ When it comes to questions of how
seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks in the nation's
state capitals, the answers often depend on the particular stadiums
in which they are warming the bench. In some states, the No. 2
person actually has clout, and campaigns for the job are serious
matters. By Jacques Steinberg. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EURO-CURRENCY-REVIEW _ Just 10 weeks before 11 European
countries adopt the euro as a common currency on Jan. 1, eventually
replacing marks, francs and lira, Europe has suddenly become the
world's bastion of economic safety. Far from being alarmed about
the changes and uncertainties ahead, traders have seized upon
European currencies _ including the lira _ as their preferred safe
haven from the turmoil rocking Asia, Russia and now even the United
States. By Edmund L. Andrews. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEACE-MESSENGERS-REVIEW _ In the television-oriented 1990s,
policy wonks are using celebrities to get their messages across.
Maybe it is inevitable that groups like the population fund, which
provides contraception and counseling, would turn to entertainers
and athletes to reach a wider audience than do the policy-makers
who inhabit Sunday-morning interview shows. At the United Nations,
Secretary General Kofi Annan has his own ``messengers for peace'' _
Magic Johnson, Muhammad Ali, Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who
said last summer that ``this probably means as much to me as any of
the two Oscars that I got.'' By James Barron. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW _ Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's strongman,
knows the playbook well. His first big performance was in Bosnia;
his second has just been completed in the Serbian province of
Kosovo. The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other
way, create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by
destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many
massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a
grand gesture grant some concessions _ like allowing monitors on
the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above. The
climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable keeper of
the peace; American and NATO officials come to consult and
sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of
your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and
protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which
you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more
years in power as their autocratic ruler. By Jane Perlez.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The body language in the East Room of the White House on Friday
was more eloquent than the words that were uttered and the accords
that were signed. For the first time since Benjamin Netanyahu
became prime minister of Israel more than two years ago, he looked
at ease with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The distrust
and stiffness between the leaders seemed to be gone, replaced by
the kind of respect and partnership that can make a permanent peace
possible in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   That growing trust and cooperation may be the most important
achievements of the nine days and eight sleepless nights of
bargaining and posturing in Maryland. The agreements reached by the
Wye River point the way toward a Middle East settlement. But
without faith in one another, Netanyahu and Arafat will never reach
that destination or work through the spasms of terrorism that are
likely to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland agreements, if fully carried out, should remove
many of the tangled issues that have paralyzed the peace effort
over the last 19 months. Thanks to intense, sustained mediation by
President Clinton and his aides, and the inspirational intervention
of King Hussein of Jordan, the two leaders settled on a detailed
plan to preserve Israeli security. U.S. intelligence officers, who
already work with Israeli and Palestinian security officials, will
closely monitor Palestinian authorities to insure that they arrest
terrorist suspects and confiscate illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Israel agreed to withdraw its troops from a further 13 percent
of West Bank territory, bringing to 40 percent the amount under
full or partial Palestinian control. Both sides now accept this as
a reasonable next installment on a final settlement. It allows the
Palestinians to enter the final phase of talks with an overwhelming
majority of the West Bank's Palestinian population, and a decent
portion of its territory, under their administration. The
Palestinians also agreed to complete the revision of their national
charter so there will no longer be any calls for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If all these pieces of the peace puzzle can be held in place in
the months ahead, the two sides can find an imaginative way of
reconciling Israel's insistence that Jerusalem remain unified and
under its authority with Palestinian demands that some part of
Jerusalem become the capital of a future Palestinian state. They
must decide the status of some 150,000 Jewish settlers now living
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, many in the heart of what
would probably be Palestinian territory under a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements must also be worked out for dividing up the rest of
the West Bank between Israeli security zones and
Palestinian-administered territory. Forms of Palestinian statehood
must be explored that would not create a military threat to Israeli
survival. Less dramatic, but just as important, scarce water
resources must be fairly apportioned.
</P>
<P>
   It would greatly assist the resolution of all these matters if
the case of Jonathan Pollard did not again enter the discussions.
Pollard's espionage work for Israel in Washington properly led to
his conviction. How long he remains in federal prison has nothing
to do with the peace talks, and should not have become a disruptive
issue in the last hours of the Maryland summit meeting. Making
peace in the Middle East will be hard enough without such
distractions.

VALLONE SAYS VOTERS SHOULD PRESS PATAKI TO AGREE TO DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frustrated by what he called a lack of attention to
his gubernatorial campaign, Peter Vallone said Friday that the
public should be taking his proposals more seriously and pressuring
Gov. George Pataki to debate him.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview with editors and reporters at The New
York Times, Vallone, who is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee
and the speaker of the New York City Council, spent considerably
more time lashing out at Pataki than discussing his own platform.
He angrily questioned why the Republican governor had remained
popular despite increasing the state's debt, vetoing spending on
education and failing to reform the state's campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said he was especially annoyed that Pataki had treated
him as if he were invisible, refusing to debate him or even to
acknowledge Vallone's questions about his record.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has repeatedly demanded debates, but the governor
has refused to be pinned down, saying only that it was up to his
campaign staff to arrange debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, what I'm saying here is, do you realize what's going
on?'' the normally placid Vallone said, raising his voice. ``Do you
have any conception that you have a governor in office that no one
knows anything about, that doesn't stand still long enough to be
questioned, that refuses to debate?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The best way I can describe it would be, I think
George Pataki is a hologram. He's there, but he's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vallone easily won the Democratic primary last month,
he spent most of the $5.7 million he has raised on that effort, and
has struggled in recent weeks to get his message out across the
state. Pataki, who is popular and much better known than Vallone,
has raised nearly $20 million for his re-election campaign and
invested much of it in television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who recently shepherded legislation through the council
that would discourage city candidates from accepting donations from
corporations, questioned why Pataki had not moved to limit the
amount statewide candidates could spend on campaigns. He suggested
that Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, another Republican seeking
re-election, were not only raising millions of dollars for their
campaigns, but were intimidating potential donors into withholding
donations to Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Times reporters and editors last week,
Pataki said that he found the state's campaign financing system
``dreadful,'' but added that he had not come up with a plan to
change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any realization about the accumulation of funds
that is taking place in the Pataki-D'Amato machine?'' Vallone said.
``Do you have any idea of why so many people are giving to that
campaign and are afraid to give to any other campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said that as governor, he would create thousands of jobs
by passing a law that would encourage state and local government to
hire and purchase goods from New York state firms. New York City
has such a law, he said, and it keeps the city from losing jobs and
contracts to New Jersey or Connecticut. A similar bill reached
Pataki's desk last year, but he vetoed it because he feared other
states would retaliate by refusing to hire laborers from New York,
Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a law would create at least 40,000 jobs each year, Vallone
said. ``I wouldn't mind if we were No. 1, but we're No. 47 out of
48 in job creation,'' Vallone said. ``That's a substantive issue.
Should he not be coming forward and talking about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone also proposed eliminating managed care and private
insurance companies, which he said have too steep profit margins
and spend too much on administrative costs. He would replace them
with a state-run health care system, using money from the state's
anticipated settlement with tobacco companies to provide health
insurance to the working poor and to reduce the state's Medicaid
burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to get across here is, I've come up with some
very substantive proposed plans for job creation, for health care
and for education,'' Vallone said. ``I have put forth issues which
I think are very, very important. That's the only reason I'm
running, is that I believe that this state is crying out for
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at his frustration with press coverage of his campaign,
he added:, ``I've had major press conferences. If you choose not to
cover it, that's different. But I had major press conferences on
every one of these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone seemed stung because Pataki had not used the City
Council's campaign finance legislation as a model for campaign
finance reform at the state level. The legislation is not yet in
effect _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vetoed it last month, and the
council just overrode the veto Thursday _ but Vallone said that
``most people in the entire nation have already copied, or at least
asked me about'' the package.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the interview, Vallone appeared the most
irritated about Pataki's refusal to debate him. He returned to the
subject numerous times, asking why the news media and the voters
were not angry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have the right to tell the people of this city
or the people of this state, `I choose not to debate,''' Vallone
said. ``If I'm choosing to put myself out there as a citywide or a
statewide candidate, this man, this governor, should sit down and
debate. Where is the outrage?''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: N.Y. MAYOR DANCES WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the gentle smiles and the strong colors of autumn, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seemed an odd addition this week to the
scenic state of New Hampshire. Trying out a new audience for his
old Marlon Brando imitation and his bragging stats on New York
City, The Mayor Who Tamed the Capital of the World suddenly landed
in civility central, a quilted haven where people tend to raise
their voices only at football games.
</P>
<P>
   So why was he in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential
primary, generating a New York buzz amid the soft cries of birds
going south for the winter?
</P>
<P>
   Not because he's test-running for president, he protested with a
sly grin. He was up there to see if Republican national
committeewoman Ruth Griffin would vote for New York City as the
site of the Republican Party Convention in the year 2000. He was up
there to take pictures of the foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Sure he was, the New Hampshire natives nodded agreeably. For all
their feigned quaintness, these veterans pride themselves on being
able to spot a presidential yearning in the best pre-season
camouflage. More important, with less than two years remaining
until the next presidential season, they know exactly what to do
with these nascent, barely contained desires _ fan them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with a primary as wide open as New Hampshire's, he
could win,'' cooed Republican state chairman Stephen Duprey to
reporters trailing New York's mayor.``We need quality candidates
like this,'' said Augusta Petrone, whose husband is a big
contributor in the state.
</P>
<P>
   This is fishing season in New Hampshire, where residents and
political people alike are trying to add candidates the way the
admissions director of a college tries to encourage applicants.
More is better, more is exciting. More means that the whole
whiz-bang New Hampshire madness is once again on track _ several
thousand political reporters jammed into a miniature monolithic
state where every voter picks candidates by the whites of their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So Giuliani and New Hampshire flirted vigorously this week. To
energetic applause, the mayor offered his strategy for a Republican
candidate to take back the White House in two years. ``The way you
win an election is by contesting the other person's vote,'' he
explained. Democrats usually win the cities, and Giuliani is a
Republican who has been elected twice as mayor of the biggest city
in America. The logic is unsinkable, unless, of course, you ask how
the mayor of New York City could win in the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had an answer to that one too, describing how New York
had responded to Republican principles just like other areas of the
country. New York is diverse, he said, like most of America, both
urban and suburban. He wasn't sure New York could count as rural
exactly, but, he offered, ``parts of Staten Island might qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally came the clincher. He was asked whether New Hampshire
should be the first presidential primary, and he agreed it should.
This is like asking somebody in the Bronx if the Yankees should
stay there. ``Sure,'' the mayor said, flashing the full-Buick grin,
``somebody has to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a long and otherwise rousing day, however, the
mayor found himself at one of those dead evenings that are the
lifeblood of politics. The Republican women's club of Nashua, all
50 of them, sat like stones while the mayor rambled through his
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it became clear to the regulars in the room that this
guy would need a little polish if he wanted to outshine Steve
Forbes, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and even former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, who, as Duprey put it, never left New Hampshire
after he ran third in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it had seemed easy to imagine New York's mayor in
the White House marathon. But the idea of polishing Rudy or making
him say the right political thing instead of exactly what he's
thinking at the time . . . nah, too difficult. So maybe the mayor
really was up there to sell New York for the next GOP convention
and to help raise money for candidates. Maybe he was in New
Hampshire to see the leaves. Really.

BALLOT MEASURE MAY AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Less than a month ago, Gov. Pete Wilson let loose
national political lightning by signing a bill moving California's
presidential primary to the front of the pack in 2000, on March 7,
just after New Hampshire and Iowa. But unless voters here pass an
obscure ballot measure next month, the new primary may be virtually
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   That is because both major national political parties require
that delegates to their nominating conventions be chosen by party
members only, but two years ago, voters in California created a
blanket primary system, in which all candidates' names appear on a
single ballot, regardless of party, and Democratic and Republican
voters can mix and match.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, Wilson and the Legislature agreed to put a measure
on the Nov. 3 ballot, returning the state's presidential primary to
the old system, in which voters from each party get separate
ballots. But the measure has drawn little public notice and no
financial backing amid a raft of tight races.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure, known as Proposition 3, fails, the California
parties could be forced to create some kind of elaborate and costly
parallel system _ caucuses, conventions, or mail-in balloting _ to
choose their delegates, while the primary would be just for show.
That has political professionals here gnashing their teeth in rare
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few things where Republicans and Democrats
agree,'' said Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant in
Sacramento. ``But for all the hoopla about the new primary, we're
going to be relegated to a beauty contest if this doesn't pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of moving up the primary was to increase California's
influence, after years in which the state's June primary came too
late to make it a player.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort will be moot if Proposition 3 fails. It is too
late for the national parties to change their rules, even if they
wanted to _ and they do not.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' only other hope is a challenge to the open primary
law now pending in the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. A federal
judge earlier ruled that the open primary served an important
purpose in giving voters greater choice, and fell within strict
limits set by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A recent statewide Field Poll found that 83 percent of likely
voters were not even aware of Proposition 3, and that even after
the ballot description was read to them, only 26 percent said they
would vote ``yes'' on it. The telephone poll of 703 likely voters
had a margin of error of five and a half percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Election experts were aware of the potential problem when the
measure was passed in 1996, but it drew little public notice then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of `open' sounded nice to people,'' said state
Republican chairman Michael Schroeder. ``They didn't realize what
the effect would be.''
</P>
<P>
   If Proposition 3 fails, Schroeder said the parties here, like
those in the other two states with blanket primaries, Alaska and
Washington, would have no choice but to adopt some new system, like
caucuses, conventions or mail-in ballots to select delegates. But
he said that such options were undesirable and that a mail-in
election could cost $500,000, which would have to be financed by
the party, unlike a normal election, which is financed by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Democratic Party, Bob Mulholland,
agreed that none of the options seemed practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we don't like,'' Mulholland said, ``but
we'll just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that national Republican Party rules allowed
states with blanket primaries to select their delegates at any
time. The California Republicans have already set their 2000 state
convention for the second week of February, and Schroeder said,
``Whatever we end up doing, we'll probably do it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventions or caucuses tend to draw the most die-hard party
members, which means liberals for the Democrats and conservatives
for Republicans. That prospect is unappealing to a moderate like
Wilson, a Republican who hoped the moved-up primary could be a key
to a possible Presidential candidacy of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a pretty strange thing for the parties to try to
set up a caucus and ignore the results of a primary,'' said
Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh.

HEDGE FUND FIRM SAYS IT COVERED ITS LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Conn.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellington Capital Management, the hedge fund firm in Old
Greenwich, Conn., that was forced to sell many of its holdings to
meet margin calls earlier this month, told its investors on Friday
that the losses in its three funds, while sizable, appeared to be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   By selling nearly $2 billion of its holdings over the last two
weeks, the firm appears to have been able to meet all its margin
calls. The funds are also said to have significantly reduced the
amount they borrow, leaving them less vulnerable to any further
market downturns.
</P>
<P>
   The firm _ run by Michael Vranos, who had been a star mortgage
bond trader at Kidder, Peabody _ was among several hedge fund
companies that have been rocked by the recent turbulence in the
bond markets. When the value of their mortgage-related securities
fell sharply in mid-October, Ellington received margin calls from
its lenders and was forced to unload hundreds of millions of
dollars of its holdings in a two-day period.
</P>
<P>
   The funds have had losses that are said to average around 25
percent so far this month, but Ellington seems to have successfully
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the actions we took were effective in
protecting our investors' capital,'' said David Bailin, the firm's
executive vice president.

 &HT;    Schrader to start from pole spot
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Ken Schrader won another Winston Cup pole Friday, his
22nd, which he appreciates. But, if it's OK, he would pay 80 grand
to stand just once on a Winston Cup winner's stage.
</P>
<P>
   It took Schrader 27.432 seconds to put his No. 22 Monte Carlo on
the pole for Sunday's Dura-Lube 500 with a speed of 131.234 miles
per hour on the one-mile flat oval.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader hasn't stood on a Winston Cup winner's stage in 232
races, dating back to Dover, Del., June 2, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say. We've just got to win and we can win
Sunday,'' said Schrader, who has won nine times on this track
competing on the Southwest Tour, Midgets and Silver Crown series.
``We've had plenty of reasons keeping us from it. Most of the time
when you don't win races, it's because we didn't do our job good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin was second fastest at 131.205 mph, meaning he'll
make his first front-row appearance of the season. Joining him in
the top 10 are Kenny Wallace, 130.605; Bill Elliott, 130.373; Rich
Bickle, 130.279; Rusty Wallace, 130.180; Rick Mast, 130.105; Mike
Skinner, 130.100; David Green, 130.025; and Ted Musgrave, 129.931.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, only the Wallaces, Elliott and Skinner have spent any
time on the first five rows. For Rusty Wallace, this is 11 for 11
at Phoenix. Mark Martin and Jeff Gordon can pay close attention to
their each from their fifth row perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Gordon said. ``I overdrove it into
(turn) one and missed my line big time. We're trying to win races,
win poles. We're not thinking about a whole lot than coming to
Phoenix and running well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is seeking redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I'm after,'' said Rusty Wallace. ``I've got a
chance for third place in the the points. If you can't get the big
one at the end of the rainbow, you've got to get all you can get.
We've messed up a couple of times when it was our's for the
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenery isn't as enticing to many who couldn't qualify 26th
or better: Jeff Burton; 46th, Michael Waltrip, 45th; Dale
Earnhardt, 42nd; Darrell Waltrip, 40th; Ernie Irvan, 39th; Bobby
Labonte, 37th; and Terry Labonte, 29th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled as a team here, there's no doubt,'' Burton
said. ``Obviously, I'm not giving them the right input, and we're
not coming here with something that feels good enough to me to
start. But, we've come from the back before and we'll do our best
to do it again.''

 &HT;    This one should bea day to remember
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For those in the state of Georgia calling themselves
college football fans, a word of advice on this beautiful Saturday
morning: Enjoy this day. When it comes to football, it doesn't get
much better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech is at home tonight playing a monster game against
Florida State for first place in the ACC and a possible spot in the
Orange Bowl. Not only will the game be televised nationally by
ESPN, but the College GameDay crew _ Fowler, Corso and Herbstreit _
are in our fair state for the second time this month.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is No. 11 and on the road at Kentucky, where a win would
set up a showdown next week in Jacksonville against No. 5 Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern (7-0) is back where the Eagles belong _ No. 1
in Division I-AA and thinking about another national championship
as they go on the road to face The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since the fans of the state's major
schools have gone this far into October and been this happy. Have
fun while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   On with this week's picks:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6 Florida State (6-1) at No. 20 Georgia Tech (5-1), 7
p.m., ESPN: The Yellow Jackets showed the right stuff last week in
beating Virginia. But the problems that existed a week ago _ most
notably a defense that gave up 600 yards _ are still there. FSU's
defense is better and its offense is rounding into shape. Florida
State knows it has no margin for error, and that makes the
Seminoles a dangerous team. Florida State 35-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Georgia (5-1) at Kentucky (5-2), 12:30 p.m.,
Jefferson-Pilot: If the Bulldogs are not on top of their game, they
could be in trouble. Tim Couch and the boys are for real on offense
and proved it by scoring 39 last Saturday at LSU. They take a ton
of chances on defense, so Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter has got
to make them pay. Let's go with the Dawgs. Georgia 38-31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama (4-2) at No. 3 Tennessee (5-0), 3:30 p.m., CBS:
Alabama is on on the way back, but the Tide is not there yet.
Tennessee has had a week off to get some of its people well and
should be ready for the stretch drive. Traditionally, Alabama has
kept this game close, but not this time. Tennessee 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 24 Mississippi State (5-1) at LSU (3-3), 6 p.m., ESPN2:
The Tigers' defense was passed silly by Georgia, Florida and
Kentucky. Now, LSU gets a running team that plays solid, if not
spectacular, football. It's tempting to pick LSU because the Tigers
are due. But Mississippi State needs a win to stay on top in the
SEC West. Miss. State 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 UCLA at California (4-2), 3:30 p.m. The Bruins are ripe
for a letdown after emotional wins over Arizona and Oregon. Cal has
already beaten Southern Cal. This game will be closer than the
experts think. UCLA 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 19 Missouri (5-1) at Nebraska (7-1), 12:30 p.m.: This is
the anniversary of Matt Davison's shoe-string catch that allowed
Nebraska to beat Missouri and stay alive for the national title.
Nebraska 35-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 25 Texas Tech (6-1) at No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M (6-1), 3:30 p.m.:
Texas Tech has a three-game winning streak over the Aggies. Running
back Ricky Williams is second in the nation in rushing (166.9 yards
per game). Texas A&AMP;M, its only loss to Florida State, could
solidify its spot at the top of the Big 12 South. Texas A&AMP;M 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern Cal (5-2) at No. 12 Oregon (5-1), 6:30 p.m.: The
Ducks had a costly 41-38 loss to UCLA, with running back Reuben
Droughns lost for the season with a broken leg. Oregon still has
Akili Smith, the nation's No. 2 passer, and a good crew of
receivers. Oregon 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miami (3-2) at No. 13 West Virginia (4-1), 3:30 p.m.: West
Virginia gets linebacker Gary Stills back after an injury. Miami
has scored 191 points in its first five games, its best scoring
output of the decade. West Virginia, whose only loss was to No. 1
Ohio State, is very tough at home. West Virginia 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   _ Army (2-4) at No. 18 Notre Dame (4-1), 2:30 p.m., NBC: Notre
Dame is 21-1 against the service academies since 1986. The Irish
play Army, Baylor, Boston College and Navy the next four weeks.
Notre Dame 42-10.
</P>
<P>
   The others
</P>
<P>
   ACC _ Clemson 24, Duke 10; North Carolina 17, Wake Forest 16;
Virginia 28, N.C. State 24.
</P>
<P>
   SEC _ Ole Miss 35, Arkansas State 17; Auburn 24, La. Tech 23;
South Carolina 17, Vanderbilt 7.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25 _ No. 1 Ohio State 42, Northwestern 7; No. 4 Kansas State
48, Iowa State 17; No. 9 Wisconsin 31, Iowa 14; No. 22 Tulane 35,
Rutgers 28.
</P>
<P>
   Last week _ 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   Season _ 100-37 (72.9 pct.).

 &HT;    Ga. Southern sees D as key vs. Citadel
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Despite an offense that has averaged 514
yards a game in its last six, Georgia Southern coach Paul Johnson
thinks defense will be the key for his top-ranked Eagles against
The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are coming off a strong defensive effort in last
week's 37-24 victory over Appalachian State. Senior defensive end
Eric Davis had five tackles behind the line of scrimmage, while
linebackers Daryl Morrell and Josh Smithers combined for 19 tackles
against a team that defeated Wake Forest two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Morrell, a sophomore from Mableton, Ga., was returning after
missing two games because of a neck injury. He also blocked a
field-goal attempt and swatted away a pass attempt to help secure
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys who make a play even if he's not in the
right place,'' Johnson said about Morrell. ``No question it's a
big, big plus having him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern (7-0, 5-0 Southern Conference) enters the game
with the nation's top rushing offense. Led by junior quarterback
Greg Hill and freshman fullback Adrian Peterson, the Eagles are
averaging 6.5 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who is averaging 169 yards per game, needs 168 yards
to surpass the school's single-season rushing record of 1,354 yards
set by Joe Ross in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   THE CITADEL VS. GEORGIA SOUTHERN
</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, 2 p.m., Hagood, Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Georgia Southern leads 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Georgia Southern 7-0 (5-0).
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: Top-ranked Georgia Southern will be seeking its
third-straight Southern Conference road victory. ... In their last
six games, the Eagles have averaged 514.2 yards of total offense.
... The Citadel, which has switched from the wishbone to the
I-formation, is coming off an impressive victory over Furman in
Greenville. ... Bulldogs' QB Stanley Myers has thrown for 122 yards
a game and is the team's second-leading rusher behind TB Antonio
Smith, who is averaging 91 yards a game.

 &HT;    Dogs, Cats do battle in critical SEC match
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia is past the midpoint of its season, and
the Bulldogs are right where coach Jim Donnan thought they would
be.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 11 Bulldogs, 5-1 overall and 3-1 in the SEC, continue to
win the games they're expected to and stole a victory earlier this
month at LSU, perhaps the league's most disappointing team this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia enters its most critical stretch, beginning with
today's contest at Kentucky, the first of three straight road dates
for the Dogs, who have won their last seven games away from home.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still much at stake for Georgia: A victory over
Kentucky would set up a possible showdown of top-10 teams in
Jacksonville next week, when the Bulldogs battle No. 5 Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is a bonus year for us,'' Donnan said. ``It really
is. We're just trying to steal some wins. I really felt like next
year would be the year we had the caliber of talent and the numbers
that we need. But we've been pretty consistent. In the last six
games, we've stubbed our toe only once. That's pretty good. We're
letting everyone know that last year wasn't a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats also are battling for respect. Some are calling
today's meeting the biggest football event in the commonwealth this
decade. With its third win in a row, Kentucky not only would climb
above .500 in the SEC for the first time since 1993 but also would
qualify for its first bowl game in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people look at Kentucky and say, `Well,
they've got a great offense, but they can't win in the SEC,' ''
Wildcats quarterback Tim Couch said. ``We're trying to prove people
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats also want to prove that last year's 23-13 loss in
Athens was a fluke. Kentucky, hindered by a steady rain, found the
end zone just twice in Sanford Stadium, the lowest scoring total in
18 games under second-year coach Hal Mumme. The strong-armed Couch
threw for 324 yards on 41-of-55 passing, but he also was
intercepted three times.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is expected to defend Couch and Mumme's pass-happy
attack in a similar fashion today, allowing the record-setting
quarterback to throw underneath but attempting to contain him deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our defense will play better against them,'' Donnan
said. ``Look what Florida did against them (in a 51-35 win by the
Gators on Sept. 26). You take away three big plays, and Florida
shut them down pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan also seems confident that his offense, behind freshman
quarterback Quincy Carter and two-way star Champ Bailey, will
exploit the Wildcats' aggressive, blitzing defense, which ranks
next-to-last in the SEC in points allowed and passing and total
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're keeping people out of the end zone, but they're still
giving up a lot of yards and points,'' Donnan said. ``It should be
a shootout.

WITH JUST FIVE STEPS, RANGERS MIGHT BE THE 1999 YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The foe is mighty. But this year's Yankees, history tells us,
can always become last year's Braves.
</P>
<P>
   A well-heeled also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, glory is fleeting. Dynasty today, gone tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency can pollute a team's vital chemistry, not to mention
disrupt a batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the mighty New York Yankees may not have lapped the
Rangers as many revolutions as one would think. Rome fell. So can
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   But it's going to take a plan. A Rangers Five-Part Makeover
Plan. Cue the theme from Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   1. Sign Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Have you checked the list of free-agent shortstops? How does
Andy Stankiewicz sound?
</P>
<P>
   Clayton passed his two-month trial with the Rangers with
trumpets and colors. Management knew he was a slick fielder, but he
scored bonus points with both his hustle and the surprising pop in
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Critics mention his .234 average in St. Louis, but Clayton hit
.285 in 52 games for the Rangers and his .441 slugging percentage
was nearly as good as third baseman Todd Zeile's.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, Clayton's broad range at shortstop
helped make Rangers pitching better. The staff's earned run average
in July was 5.62. After Clayton arrived, it was 4.68.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $3.5 million this season, and he figures to cost the
Rangers at least $15 million over three seasons. Best of all, he
wants to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sign Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The most lopsided edge in the Rangers-Yankees comparison is the
pitching matchups. If Stottlemyre goes against David Wells, who
goes next against David Cone? The Yankees have El Duque; the
Rangers have El Whammo.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson comes, Stottlemyre or Rick Helling provide an
appropriate follow-up at the 2-3 spots on the starting staff. Aaron
Sele slides to a more competitive No. 4, leaving John Burkett to
round out the rotation as the fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   Pair Johnson against Wells, Stottlemyre against Cone, Helling
against ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Sele against Andy Pettitte and
Burkett against Hideki Irabu, and the Rangers are at least in the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre will have trouble getting staff-ace money, whether
it's Arizona (Andy Benes) or back to St. Louis (Matt Morris). He
could cost in the $6 million per year range.
</P>
<P>
   But it's pitching. If you have to ask, you can't afford it. And
under new owner Tom Hicks, the Rangers don't have to always ask.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson Derby will be intriguing. The big lefty lives in
Arizona, but why would he want to go and do something stifling like
that?
</P>
<P>
   No state income tax _ that needs to be Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin's mantra between now and the time Johnson is signed. If
he signs with the Rangers, Melvin needs to remind him, Johnson also
gets to pitch regularly against his smiling buddy, Ken Griffey Jr.
Johnson, it has been rumored, would like that.
</P>
<P>
   3. Reseed the bullpen with left-handed arms.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to use the Yankees as a measuring stick, Scott
Bailes, Eric Gunderson, Greg Cadaret and Tony Fossas do not match
up well against Graeme Lloyd and Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent list is dotted with capable left arms, among them
Dennis Cook, Scott Radinsky, Greg Swindell, Butch Henry and Mike
Magnante.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Hicks needs to pick just two. The preferences here would
be former Rangers pitcher Cook (2.38 ERA in 68 innings with the
Mets) and Swindell (3.59 in 90 innings with the Red Sox). Boston's
Butch Henry, coming off knee _ not shoulder _ surgery, is an
interesting possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell earned $1.3 million this past season, and Cook made
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   4. Take advantage of Todd Zeile's folly.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's agent has said he wants to exercise Zeile's right as a
player traded in the middle of a multiyear contract and demand a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the Rangers get to holler, ``Bingo.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile finished the season with remarkably commendable statistics
_ a .271 average overall with 19 home runs and 94 runs batted in.
But the guy has made 49 errors at third base in two seasons and
adds zero charisma to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Takers, anyone? Please?
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was making $3.2 million. San Diego's Ken Caminiti earned
$3.5 million and figures to go on the free-agent market for only a
modest raise. Caminiti was bothered by leg injuries and batted .213
over the final two months, but he is only two years removed from a
40-homer season and is a fierce competitor. Plus, he's a
switch-hitter and can take aim at The Ballpark's Home Run Porch.
</P>
<P>
   5. Find some patience at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the Yankee formula. The Rangers need to boost their team
on-base percentage, and the two most conspicuous lead-off men on
the free-agent rolls are Tony Phillips and Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Either could bat first and be the designated hitter. That could
free the Rangers to form a power-hitting first-base platoon of Mike
Simms and Lee Stevens. Their combined stats _ 36 homers and 105 RBI
_ more than favorably compare with Will Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   The Five-Part Makeover Plan, admittedly, would not come cheap.
But you'll notice there are no Bernie Williamses or Mo Vaughns to
hike the price, either. In this plan, money is spent in all the
right places.
</P>
<P>
   The foe is mighty. But Rome fell, too.
</P>
<P>
   Must have been the state income tax.

<P>
   Alfred W. Van Sinderen, who served as the top executive of
Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. for 17 years, died
Oct. 12 at the Harborside Healthcare-Willows, a nursing home in
Woodbridge, Conn. He was 74 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sinderen's wife, Suzanne, said he had been at the Willows
since shortly after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage more than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sinderen, who had become the telephone company's most senior
executive, with the title of president, in 1967, gave up
operational control in 1984 and retired a year later as chairman.
He had been with the company 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Van Sinderen began teaching at Yale University's
graduate school of management. He increased his duties at Yale when
he left the telephone company and also took on a series of civic
projects. In one civic job, he served as president of the
Foundation for the New Haven Green from 1986 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Van Sinderen received an undergraduate degree from Yale and a
master's degree in business administration from the Harvard
Business School. He served as a naval officer in the Pacific during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Van Sinderen is survived by five
children, Alexander Van Sinderen of Lafayette, Calif.; Sylvia
Abbate of Cheshire, Conn.; Jean Vashaw of Ridgefield, Wash.;
Katherine Tucker of Waxhaw, N.C., and Alex Madlener of Woodbridge,
Conn.; two sisters, Katharine Howe of Delray Beach, Fla., and Jean

   James P. McFadden, an editor, publisher and prominent Roman
Catholic layman, died on Oct. 17 at his home on the Upper East Side
of Manhattan. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an esophageal hemorrhage, and he also had cancer,
said William F. Buckley Jr., editor at large of National Review,
where McFadden was on staff for more than 25 years, 12 of them as
associate publisher.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden had been the editor of The Human Life Review, a
quarterly journal of scholarship opposed to abortion, since he
founded it in 1974. He had also been chairman of the National
Committee of Catholic Laymen since founding it in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Youngstown, Ohio, he graduated in 1953 from
Youngstown College and was in the Army from 1954 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Faith; three daughters, Maria Maffucci
of Manhattan, the executive editor of Human Life Review, Regina

IN DEBATE, FRANKS SAYS DODD DOES LITTLE FOR CONNECTICUT

   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ Gary Franks, the Republican seeking to
unseat Sen. Christopher Dodd, used their opening debate Friday
night to scold Connecticut's senior senator repeatedly, accusing
him of missing crucial votes and paying more attention to Hollywood
than to the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
disputed few of the accusations, but instead responded placidly and
with occasional humor, stressing accomplishments like his
sponsorship of the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows workers
to take time off without pay to care for a sick child or family
member.
</P>
<P>
   Franks brought up the DNC _ the issue his staff calls ``the
bomb'' because of the associated campaign fund-raising
controversies _ when he noted that Dodd had served 24 years in the
House or Senate without serving as ranking member or chairman of a
committee. Franks, said, ``The only thing he headed was a party,
and that doesn't count, as far as I'm concerned.'' He added that
Connecticut was not receiving its fair share of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up!'' he told Dodd at one point. ``We need these
dollars.'' Franks went on, ``You can't explain this away, Chris.
You've missed so many votes, you don't show up, you've stayed away
from the state 90 consecutive weekends _ 90 consecutive weekends.
How are you supposed to be in touch with the people of
Connecticut?''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he believed he had delivered for the people of
Connecticut, and said he would leave it up to them to decide if he
had enough clout. ``It's not just the chair you sit in,'' he said,
``it's what you do in the chair you're in.'' He then joked that, in
view of some of the budget cuts Franks supported when he was in
Congress, he wished that Franks had missed a few more votes than he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said he had a voting record of 98 percent for the last six
years, and 95 percent for his 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, held in a renovated theater now called the Garde
Arts Center, was sponsored by The Day of New London and the League
of Women Voters of Connecticut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Franks referred over and over to Dodd as ``Chris,'' while the
senator consistently referred to Franks as ``my opponent.'' The
format was loose, allowing the candidates to decide how many
rebuttals they wanted to take. At one point, when the moderator
asked if he wanted to respond to one of Franks' fusillades, Dodd
suppressed his apparent annoyance and said, ``Why don't you just
move along?''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about campaign financing, Franks said 75 to 85
percent of his contributors were from Connecticut, a statement he
said his opponent could not make. ``Most of his dollars are coming
from New York City, Washington, D.C., and California _ the
Hollywood, Beltway, Broadway candidate,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd responded that he had received donations from 8,000
individuals, half of which were for $100 or less. ``I also believe
that my strongest support has come from small donors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being far too modest,'' Franks cut in, ``because he's one
of the leaders of the PAC.''
</P>
<P>
   In Franks' closing statement, he referred to his status as a
Republican who is black. ``There are some people out there who are
of color who may have never voted for a Republican, and there are
some white people out there who may have never voted for a black
individual,'' he said. ``I know that in this great state of ours,
that's not an impediment, it's just an interesting little twist.
And I also know that when all is said and done, when you look at my
record versus my opponent, what I plan to do for Connecticut and
for your families, you will see a distinct difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd used his closing statement to thank the state's voters for
the chance to serve. ``We talk a lot about our records and so
forth,'' he said. ``I think people in an election want to know what
you're for, as well _ what your plans are for the future. I think
we need to keep our economy on a steady foot: a good fiscal policy.
We need to improve our educational system. I mentioned health care
as a critical issue. I'd like to see us do better with
transportation and privacy. We're about to have the last election
of the 20th century, and I think we need to prepare well for that
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' second and final debate will be held Thursday in
Farmington, west of Hartford.

</P>
<P>
   Dodd responded that he had received donations from 8,000
individuals, half of which were for $100 or less. ``I also believe
that my strongest support has come from small donors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being far too modest,'' Franks cut in, ``because he's one
of the leaders of the PAC.''
</P>
<P>
   In Franks' closing statement, he referred to his status as a
Republican who is black. ``There are some people out there who are
of color who may have never voted for a Republican, and there are
some white people out there who may have never voted for a black
individual,'' he said. ``I know that in this great state of ours,
that's not an impediment, it's just an interesting little twist.
And I also know that when all is said and done, when you look at my
record versus my opponent, what I plan to do for Connecticut and
for your families, you will see a distinct difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd used his closing statement to thank the state's voters for
the chance to serve. ``We talk a lot about our records and so
forth,'' he said. ``I think people in an election want to know what
you're for, as well _ what your plans are for the future. I think
we need to keep our economy on a steady foot: a good fiscal policy.
We need to improve our educational system. I mentioned health care
as a critical issue. I'd like to see us do better with
transportation and privacy. We're about to have the last election
of the 20th century, and I think we need to prepare well for that
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' second and final debate will be held Thursday in
Farmington, west of Hartford.

RIVER PRESERVE IS EFFORT TO SAVE DESERT SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's dedication of the San Pedro River Preserve is part of
a last-ditch effort to save the endangered Southwestern willow
flycatcher and some of Arizona's best remaining desert forests.
</P>
<P>
   This 876-acre swath of cottonwood and willow trees, a vibrant
ribbon of green that snakes across the otherwise languid tan hues
of the Sonoran Desert, is the 13th preserve in Arizona run by the
Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   This national conservation group now protects more than 28
square miles of wildlife habitat across the state. In partnerships
with state and federal agencies and with private landowners and
local communities, the conservancy has helped preserve nearly 300
square miles of sensitive lands in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The new preserve, about 35 miles south of Globe, near Winkleman,
flanks nearly three miles of the San Pedro, the state's last major
undammed river and a relic of a once-vast complex of desert rivers
that covered Arizona like a web.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 90 percent of Arizona's rivers have been turned
into dry washes because of dams. And even the San Pedro is in
danger of drying up in coming decades because of water demands in
the rapidly growing communities of Fort Huachuca and Sierra Vista,
upstream from the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Though its intentions are praised as lofty, the conservancy's
moves to preserve land are under attack from private-property
advocates on one side and other environmental groups who contend
the conservancy doesn't do enough for wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The San Pedro River Preserve was purchased with the help of a
$4.4 million grant from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The federal
dam agency sees the preserve as an alternative for flycatcher
habitat that will be drowned once floodwaters fill behind Roosevelt
Dam, which was raised 77 feet, to 357 feet, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people, are losing three times,'' said Elizabeth
West, assistant director of the American Land Rights Association, a
group based in Battle Ground, Wash., that advocates for
private-property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using our (tax) money to take productive land not only
out of production, but off the tax rolls,'' said West, explaining
that the land is no longer available for farming, grazing or timber
production.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Tucson-based Southwest Center for
Biological Diversity contends that the conservancy's new preserve
will never sustain the number of flycatchers that now ring
Roosevelt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center,
said his group still is awaiting a federal court hearing in Phoenix
on one lawsuit and is planning a second lawsuit over the potential
elimination of habitat that supported 123 of the migratory
songbirds that nested at the lake this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fight the Bureau of Reclamation to the end to
save these birds. The habitat set up on the San Pedro as mitigation
is ridiculously inadequate,'' said Suckling, adding that only five
pairs of flycatchers nest on the new preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Lake is one of three _ of a total of six _ major
flycatcher nesting areas in the Southwest that are being destroyed
because of water storage projects. The other two are at Lake Mead,
on the Arizona-Nevada border, and at Lake Isabella in California.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Conte, a spokeswoman for the conservancy, said the San
Pedro preserve is doing more than saving the flycatcher.
</P>
<P>
   The preserve also supports kites, hawks, the rare yellow-billed
cuckoo, black-chinned hummingbird and even bald eagles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the conservancy is joining with other groups to turn old
fields, ponds and an orchard back to native habitat. Among the
partners are the Arizona Water Protection Fund, the Center for
Desert Archaeology, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``As private land owners, we know that the best conservation is
done by people who love and understand the land,'' said Les Corey,
executive director of the conservancy's Arizona chapter, which
boasts nearly 24,000 members in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is too big for anyone to accomplish alone. Only when
private landowners, local communities, scientists and agencies work
together, as they are doing at the San Pedro River Preserve, will
we glimpse a future where some of the best of Arizona will be there
for our descendants,'' Corey said. &QL;

ARE BRUINS RUNNING ON EMPTY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ Maybe they haven't done it with mirrors, but look
hard enough and you begin to see a faint reflection.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the UCLA Bruins have one of the most potent and
sophisticated offenses in the land. They're third in scoring (46.6
points) and seventh in yards (497) per game. Their system, their
quarterback and their offensive line are as good as they get.
</P>
<P>
   But the gaudy numbers and the personnel do not equate, at least
not this week. Not without big-play receiver Freddie Mitchell
(broken leg). Not without big-play tailback DeShaun Foster
(sprained knee). Not with kicker Chris Sailer hobbling on a
strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   And not with a receiver corps that's one body from skeletal
entering today's game at California. One starter, Danny Farmer,
practiced sparingly this week because of sore hamstrings. The
other, Brian Poli-Dixon, spent most of the week nursing a sprained
toe and aching wrist. The top reserve, Brad Melsby, is struggling
to regain form after missing two years with injury and illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking the same thing,'' center Shawn Stuart said.
``You look at all those (injuries), and we're still scoring points.
Guys have gone down, and the output is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes back to coaching. Teams do things to stop us
for a couple drives, and we re-route. We say, `Hey, this isn't
working. Let's adjust.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Bruins are so depleted they'll use walk-on Mark
Reynosa as their third tailback today, placing added pressure on
oft-injured starter Keith Brown and reserve Jermaine Lewis, two
weeks removed from a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   They're so depleted reserve quarterback Drew Bennett may play
receiver today, based on his participation in the final seconds
against Oregon. The 6-5 Bennett is one of UCLA's best athletes,
with speed, great hands and a 38-inch vertical.
</P>
<P>
   They're so depleted walk-on Ryan Wilkins made the trip as a
sixth receiver. His spot on the 60-man travel team usually goes to
a ninth defensive lineman. Wilkins has played in two games and has
one catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have too many people to look to,'' quarterback Cade
McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's timing could not be worse. Cal (4-2, 2-1) has the
Pac-10's best defense, allowing 18.7 points and 321.8 yards. The
Bears are aggressive, fast and opportunistic (17 takeaways), and
they'll try to prevent UCLA from taking its usual routes to the end
zone _ via the ground and long passes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Oregon, the Bears probably will stack the line and dare
UCLA to run the ball five-against-nine. They'll play tight
man-to-man against the Bruins' receivers, challenging Farmer's bad
hamstrings and Poli-Dixon's bad toe.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Bruins must recognize, then counterpunch. Their best
bet is diversity _ throwing to the fullbacks, Durell Price and
Craig Walendy, and to the tight ends, Mike Grieb and Ryan Neufeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal has a really good defense,'' Stuart said. ``They have a
good enough defense to stop us. We have to adjust and find things
that are working.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous weeks, UCLA probably won't need 40
points to survive. If form holds, 20 or 25 should do. The Bears are
last in the Pac-10 in scoring, rushing yards and total yards. Their
offense has scored just nine touchdowns _ same as Lewis. For all
the accolades paid UCLA's offense, the outcome may hinge on the
Bruins keeping Cal out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   What the numbers cannot predict, of course, is psychology. The
Bruins expect Cal's best shot, just as they expect everyone's best
shot. Such is the burden of a 15-game winning streak and No. 2
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the cowboy in the black suit with the
pearl-handled guns,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``Everybody
wants to knock you off.''
</P>
<P>
   But after emotional games against Arizona and Oregon in recent
weeks, is the tank empty? Regardless of the point spread _ the
Bruins are a two-touchdown favorite _ this is not the time to
refuel. Cal can squash their Fiesta Bowl hopes as surely as Arizona
or Oregon. In addition, victory gives Cal the tiebreaker advantage
in the Rose Bowl formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose the game, Cal's in the driver's seat if they win
the rest of their games, because they beat us,'' Toledo said.
``I've tried to emphasize there are things in life you don't get
many shots at. We've positioned ourselves to play for the national
championship. We can't stub our toe.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after breaking a leg and spraining a knee and
straining a groin.

UNION FEARS FREEZE-OUT BY BASKIN-ROBBINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ice-cream retailer Baskin-Robbins got some icy
treatment from a workers union that fears the company will close
its Southern California production plant, leaving about 80 people
out of work.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen members of Teamsters Locals 630 and 63 picketed
Friday outside Baskin-Robbins' franchise training center in
suburban Burbank, saying that parent Allied Domecq -- which also
owns Togo's sandwich shops and Dunkin' Donuts -- plans to close its
suburban Vernon operation to save money.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said talk of closing the plant ``is speculation,
and Baskin-Robbins makes it a practice not to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baskin-Robbins USA Co., based in suburban Glendale, has
already said it will close its Southbury, Conn., ice cream
production facility Nov. 4, and union leaders say it's just a
matter of time before the company closes its Vernon plant as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to close up the Vernon plant,'' said Kurt
Larsen, president of Teamsters Local 630. ``They haven't directly
said so, but every indication is that they're going to do it.
They're just going to abandon 80 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said the company has contacted plants in other parts of
the country to take over production, and has tried to move its cake
line to a plant in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Huizar, a material handler in Vernon for more than four
years, said he and 15 other union members were laid off last week.
He is subject to recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking (for work) at union plants to keep our pension
-- it could be produce, it could be dairy,'' Huizar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vernon plant makes 8 million gallons of ice cream each year,
amounting to 40 percent of the company's total output. Vernon
employees make an average of $16 to $17 an hour, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough to replace these high-paying jobs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The union had timed the demonstration to coincide with the
graduation of a batch of new franchise owners from the training
program. But a security guard at the facility said the new
franchisees had left about the time the picketing started at 11:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said the company is closing the Connecticut plant to save
what amounts to less than one-tenth of a cent for the cost of an
ice-cream cone -- this despite what the union said was a $1.2
million aid package offered by the state of Connecticut that
Baskin-Robbins rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the . . . decision that this is what they're going
to do, and to hell with the people who have worked with them all
these years,'' Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Baskin-Robbins labor relations director
Ric Morris said the company has met with the union and Connecticut
state officials ``to explore alternatives to the plant closure,''
which was announced in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closure was certainly not considered without regard to the
Southbury people who have made such important contributions to the
Baskin-Robbins brand and have been part of the local
ice-cream-making tradition,'' Morris said in the statement. ``In
addition to retaining the plant's 26 drivers, our company is
committed to exploring potential work opportunities for the less
than 40 employees who will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the picketers at Friday's demonstration were not Vernon
plant employees but were there to show their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   One current Vernon worker who did walk the picket line was
Robert Poole, 26, a four-year employee who was there with his wife
and two young sons. The suburban Sun Valley couple are expecting a
daughter in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much thought I was stable,'' Poole said. ``It's a
rude awakening to realize that nothing in life is stable.''

IN NEW AD, SCHUMER USES D'AMATO'S OWN WORDS AGAINST HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer released a new television
advertisement Friday night that seeks to use Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's
own words against him: a 19-second clip of unedited news footage in
which he repeatedly denies that he ever insulted Schumer with a
Yiddish vulgarism.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after he issued his denial, and after D'Amato's own
supporters said they had heard him make the remark, the senator
acknowledged that he had said it. The Schumer advertisement shows
D'Amato voicing his denial in halting and disjointed sentences as
two messages flash at the bottom of the screen: ``New Yorkers can't
trust Al D'Amato. Eighteen years is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which Schumer's advisers turned a piece of news
footage into a commercial was evidence of the ferocity that Schumer
has shown in trying to transform D'Amato's use of the vulgarity,
and his initial denial of it, into a metaphor for the Republican
senator's public behavior and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement was released as D'Amato went to Bushwick, in
Brooklyn, to accept the endorsement of neighborhood Hispanic
leaders and tried to turn the campaign back to the subject that had
apparently served him well until earlier this week: votes Schumer
missed in Washington this year while he was campaigning for U.S.
Senate. On this stop, D'Amato cited bills of interest to Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third day in a row, D'Amato found himself responding
to Schumer's criticism of the insult and of the senator's decision
to enlist Holocaust survivors to assail the congressman's record on
Jewish issues. (Schumer is Jewish.) D'Amato strongly defended his
use of the vulgarism _ a crude way of saying ``fool'' _ as an apt
description of his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits the bill,'' said D'Amato as he abruptly cut short a
news conference Friday morning, climbing into his car and pulling
the door shut as reporters shouted questions at him through the
windows. D'Amato's aides later said he had rushed off because he
did not want to miss the parade for the Yankees in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement released Friday night marked one notable
moment in this campaign: notwithstanding all the money the
campaigns have spent on television advertisements, this was the
first one that featured D'Amato speaking. It is not unusual for
someone who has been in office as long as D'Amato has, and who is
viewed unfavorably by many voters, to stay out of his own
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, produced by Schumer's media consultant, Hank
Morris, is made up almost entirely of a clip from New York 1 News
of a news conference D'Amato held Wednesday morning to answer
questions about his remark. In it, D'Amato glances around
uncomfortably _ at one point looking straight into the camera _ as
he denies having made the remark. He also appears to renounce the
use of that kind of language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have no knowledge of ever doing it,'' D'Amato says in
the clip. ``I just don't. All right? I think it's ridiculous. I
think he's probably pretty desperate, and that's why when you ask
me do you _ I have no knowledge of it. I would never, I have never
engaged in that, I wouldn't engage in it. It's wrong. I haven't
done it. What, I'm going to do it now? It is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, D'Amato sent a letter to Schumer acknowledging
that he had used the word during a private meeting with Jewish
leaders, but saying he stood behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In Bushwick, D'Amato responded to questions about Schumer's
advertisement by attacking the congressman's attendance record.
``It's a desperate attempt to divert attention from his record,''
D'Amato said. ``And it's not going to work. We're going to continue
to contrast our work for the people of this state, our making a
difference, with the congressman putting politics _ his political
agenda _ ahead of doing the business of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator again said it was Schumer who was ``trying to inject
religion'' into the debate. Once again, he offered no examples to
support the charge. The issue first came up last weekend, when
D'Amato brought Holocaust survivors to the Holocaust Memorial Wall
across from the United Nations building to assail Schumer's record
on issues of concern to Jews. D'Amato is Roman Catholic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign aides, who earlier this week had appeared
glum over the evident success D'Amato was having in turning the
campaign into a referendum on Schumer's attendance record, could
scarcely contain their delight at the turn of events. No public
measurements of any shift in voter sentiment have been taken, but
the incident has clearly shifted the focus of the debate away from
Schumer's voting record and toward D'Amato's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer seized on D'Amato's denial that he had made the
statement to dramatize a central theme of the congressman's
campaign: that the senator is untrustworthy. Schumer's advisers
said Friday that they believed that D'Amato's initial denial of a
statement that was heard by 40 people was far more politically
significant than his use of a vulgar Yiddishism.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, D'Amato's use of the vulgarity and his
reference to Rep. Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan as ``Jerry Waddler''
_ Nadler is a large man _ inevitably encouraged a reprise, in
newspapers and on television, of other colorful incidents in the
junior senator's career.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's supporters said such incidents _ like the time D'Amato
used an exaggerated Japanese accent to mock Lance Ito, the judge in
the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, during a radio interview _ could
reinforce the belief among some voters that D'Amato's behavior did
not befit a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he defended his attacks on Schumer, D'Amato said Friday
that he remained unsure whether he had in fact said what a number
of people, including former Mayor Edward Koch, said he had. ``It
was something that, truthfully, people say I said,'' D'Amato said.
``I believe I said it, if they tell me. I have no recall at the
time. It's just that simple. It was not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Schumer appeared with B. Thomas Golisano, the
Independence Party candidate for governor, who endorsed Schumer by
offering just the kind of assault Schumer's advisers had been
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has spent the last 18 years embarrassing himself
and our state,'' Golisano said. The candidate, who is a wealthy
businessman, added: ``As a man with considerable experience in the
world of business, I can tell this very clearly: if Al D'Amato was
an officer of a major corporation, he would have been fired for his
conduct this week. There is no place in the world of politics, or
anywhere in American life, for the kind of crude comments and cheap
deceptions that Al D'Amato demonstrated this week.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican chairman William Powers responded with a
written statement referring to Schumer's missed votes. ``Based on
his sorry attendance record, it's fair to say Chuck Schumer would
be fired if he worked for Tom Golisano's company,'' Powers said.

Brooklyn, to accept the endorsement of neighborhood Hispanic
leaders and tried to turn the campaign back to the subject that had
apparently served him well until earlier this week: votes Schumer
missed in Washington this year while he was campaigning for U.S.
Senate. On this stop, D'Amato cited bills of interest to Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third day in a row, D'Amato found himself responding
to Schumer's criticism of the insult and of the senator's decision
to enlist Holocaust survivors to assail the congressman's record on
Jewish issues. (Schumer is Jewish.) D'Amato strongly defended his
use of the vulgarism _ a crude way of saying ``fool'' _ as an apt
description of his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits the bill,'' said D'Amato as he abruptly cut short a
news conference Friday morning, climbing into his car and pulling
the door shut as reporters shouted questions at him through the
windows. D'Amato's aides later said he had rushed off because he
did not want to miss the parade for the Yankees in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement released Friday night marked one notable
moment in this campaign: notwithstanding all the money the
campaigns have spent on television advertisements, this was the
first one that featured D'Amato speaking. It is not unusual for
someone who has been in office as long as D'Amato has, and who is
viewed unfavorably by many voters, to stay out of his own
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, produced by Schumer's media consultant, Hank
Morris, is made up almost entirely of a clip from New York 1 News
of a news conference D'Amato held Wednesday morning to answer
questions about his remark. In it, D'Amato glances around
uncomfortably _ at one point looking straight into the camera _ as
he denies having made the remark. He also appears to renounce the
use of that kind of language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have no knowledge of ever doing it,'' D'Amato says in
the clip. ``I just don't. All right? I think it's ridiculous. I
think he's probably pretty desperate, and that's why when you ask
me do you _ I have no knowledge of it. I would never, I have never
engaged in that, I wouldn't engage in it. It's wrong. I haven't
done it. What, I'm going to do it now? It is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, D'Amato sent a letter to Schumer acknowledging
that he had used the word during a private meeting with Jewish
leaders, but saying he stood behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In Bushwick, D'Amato responded to questions about Schumer's
advertisement by attacking the congressman's attendance record.
``It's a desperate attempt to divert attention from his record,''
D'Amato said. ``And it's not going to work. We're going to continue
to contrast our work for the people of this state, our making a
difference, with the congressman putting politics _ his political
agenda _ ahead of doing the business of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator again said it was Schumer who was ``trying to inject
religion'' into the debate. Once again, he offered no examples to
support the charge. The issue first came up last weekend, when
D'Amato brought Holocaust survivors to the Holocaust Memorial Wall
across from the United Nations building to assail Schumer's record
on issues of concern to Jews. D'Amato is Roman Catholic.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign aides, who earlier this week had appeared
glum over the evident success D'Amato was having in turning the
campaign into a referendum on Schumer's attendance record, could
scarcely contain their delight at the turn of events. No public
measurements of any shift in voter sentiment have been taken, but
the incident has clearly shifted the focus of the debate away from
Schumer's voting record and toward D'Amato's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer seized on D'Amato's denial that he had made the
statement to dramatize a central theme of the congressman's
campaign: that the senator is untrustworthy. Schumer's advisers
said Friday that they believed that D'Amato's initial denial of a
statement that was heard by 40 people was far more politically
significant than his use of a vulgar Yiddishism.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, D'Amato's use of the vulgarity and his
reference to Rep. Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan as ``Jerry Waddler''
_ Nadler is a large man _ inevitably encouraged a reprise, in
newspapers and on television, of other colorful incidents in the
junior senator's career.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's supporters said such incidents _ like the time D'Amato
used an exaggerated Japanese accent to mock Lance Ito, the judge in
the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, during a radio interview _ could
reinforce the belief among some voters that D'Amato's behavior did
not befit a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he defended his attacks on Schumer, D'Amato said Friday
that he remained unsure whether he had in fact said what a number
of people, including former Mayor Edward Koch, said he had. ``It
was something that, truthfully, people say I said,'' D'Amato said.
``I believe I said it, if they tell me. I have no recall at the
time. It's just that simple. It was not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Schumer appeared with B. Thomas Golisano, the
Independence Party candidate for governor, who endorsed Schumer by
offering just the kind of assault Schumer's advisers had been
looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has spent the last 18 years embarrassing himself
and our state,'' Golisano said. The candidate, who is a wealthy
businessman, added: ``As a man with considerable experience in the
world of business, I can tell this very clearly: if Al D'Amato was
an officer of a major corporation, he would have been fired for his
conduct this week. There is no place in the world of politics, or
anywhere in American life, for the kind of crude comments and cheap
deceptions that Al D'Amato demonstrated this week.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican chairman William Powers responded with a
written statement referring to Schumer's missed votes. ``Based on
his sorry attendance record, it's fair to say Chuck Schumer would
be fired if he worked for Tom Golisano's company,'' Powers said.

HENSON CO. PLANNING MUPPET-THEMED ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Kermit the Frog and the rest of the Muppets will
be hopping out to the masses soon.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Jim Henson Co. plans to open a series of
Muppet-themed family entertainment centers nationwide, a
spokeswoman said Friday. The facilities will not be located in
Southern California and Florida because of agreements with Walt
Disney Co. for Muppet Vision 3D attractions at Walt Disney World
near Orlando, Fla., and at the yet-to-be-built California Adventure
theme park in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Muppet Vision 3D, the last project Jim Henson worked on before
his death in 1990, opened at the Disney-MGM Studios in 1991 and
became one of the most popular attractions at the theme park. An
upgraded version of the 3D movie-and-show attraction will open in
2001 as an anchor to the Hollywood District sector at California
Adventure, now under construction in the former Disneyland parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Muppets, with such characters as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear,
Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat, date back to 1957, when Kermit sang ``I've
Grown Accustomed to Your Face'' to a purple monster on ``The
Tonight Show.'' The troupe gained fame from appearances on ``Sesame
Street,'' its own syndicated show and four movies, with a fifth,
``Muppets in Space,'' set for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Henson spokeswoman acknowledged that the yet-to-be-named
Muppet centers could wind up competing with the DisneyQuest and
Club Disney chains, which were recently launched by the
entertainment giant to attract families that don't have the time or
inclination to plan trips to Disney's main attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Club Disney play parks opened last year in suburban West Covina
and Thousand Oaks, in neighboring Ventura County, with three more
due by March. DisneyQuest, with more complex interactive
attractions, debuted in Florida in June.

CORNELL PLANS GREATER FOCUS ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the growing list of elite research universities that are
making undergraduates a higher priority, Cornell University
announced plans Friday to transform undergraduate education _
changing everything from the way students live to the way they
learn.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell president Hunter Rawlings made the announcement during a
major policy address to trustees and alumni. It comes as more and
more universities _ from Duke to Stanford to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ respond to growing criticism that they
have shifted their focus to graduate students, often at the expense
of underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a broadening recognition that this needs to be
done,'' said Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research
on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania. ``But it is
not clear that we know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings said he would ask Cornell's trustees to approve
investing more than $200 million in the coming decade in the
changes, which are intended to reach from the residence halls to
student participation in research laboratories. Cornell, in Ithaca,
N.Y., has 12,500 undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   The university will move all freshmen together on the
university's north campus, where new buildings will be built to
accommodate them. Having them together will make it easier ``to
weave academic pursuits into the fabric of student life'' for the
freshmen, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings has asked a committee of students and faculty and staff
members to develop a plan for a system of residential houses for
upper-class students, like the house systems at Harvard and Yale,
to bring students into greater contact with professors.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell also announced a campaign to raise $200 million in
endowment for student financial aid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As good as we are in undergraduate education, we aim to become
even better _ in fact, the best research university for
undergraduate education in this country,'' Rawlings said. ``The new
initiatives and financial commitment will provide the foundation
for that improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the oldest research universities, like Harvard and Yale,
started life as small undergraduate colleges, centered on nurturing
and educating their young students. But since World War II, their
research activities have mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members who once involved themselves deeply in the lives
of their colleges and of their students have increasingly become
oriented toward their graduate students and professional societies.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Kramnick, chairman of Cornell's government department, who
will head the new committee on reshaping residential life for
upperclassmen, said that had been the case at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Cornell in 1972, faculty meetings were
filled,'' he said. ``Now it is sometimes hard to get a quorum.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he and other faculty members still carried
the same teaching load, many spent less time advising and acting as
mentors for students.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, research universities have been thriving.
Endowments have soared. Applications are reaching records.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the universities have increasingly come under fire
for their preoccupation with research and neglect of
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of institutions were doing really terrific things, but
it was hit and miss,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, the chairwoman of
a report for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching last spring that called for an overhaul of undergraduate
education at universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is happening now, at Cornell and elsewhere, is
more focus on the totality of the undergraduate experience,'' said
Ms. Kenny, who is also president of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings has been trying to make changes in undergraduate life
throughout his four-year tenure at Cornell, but he said the
Carnegie report had added impetus. ``We want to be responsive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, however, said that the goal was to build on some
programs Cornell had in place, like drawing more students into
faculty research laboratories, where they can become partners in
work under way.
</P>
<P>
   He said that besides creating opportunities for more
faculty-student interaction in the residence halls, he wanted to
expand on programs like Cornell's Presidential Research Scholars
Program, in which students conduct paid, part-time research with a
faculty mentor during their four years on campus. ``I want to give
that some momentum,'' he said.

ORANGE COUNTY SET BACK IN BID TO RECOVER LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has dealt a serious blow to Orange
County's chances of recovering further damages from Wall Street
securities firms in connection with the county's 1994 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling issued late Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Gary
Taylor rejected the main legal argument the Southern California
county has been using in its lawsuits against more than a dozen
securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically means their primary case against the rest of the
Street is going to be eliminated,'' said George Simon, a lawyer
with Foley &AMP; Lardner in Chicago. He represented Fuji Securities,
which was being sued by Orange County in the case before Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer representing Orange County, agreed
that the theory rejected by Taylor represented ``the heart of the
case against the brokers.'' He said the county planned to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The county has been arguing that its former treasurer, Robert
Citron, was not authorized by state laws and the state constitution
to enter into some of the risky transactions he undertook that
eventually led to the county's bankruptcy. Therefore, the county
argued, the transactions, known as reverse repurchase agreements,
should be void and the county compensated by the brokers.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, in a 36-page ruling, concluded that ``although they
may have been unwise, speculative, or unduly risky'' the
transactions were not unauthorized and not void. ``There was
authority to act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County, which lost more than $1.6 billion in the
bankruptcy, has recovered $739 million in settlements, including
$400 million from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the Wall Street firm that
served as its financial adviser and as underwriter of $875 million
of Orange County bonds. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter settled for
$69.6 million, Nomura Securities for $47.9 million and Credit
Suisse First Boston for $52.5 million. The county also reached
settlements with a law firm and its accounting firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those existing settlements will not be affected by Thursday's
ruling, Hennigan said. He also said the county had reached, but not
yet announced, settlements with three other parties, two of them
securities firms. One is Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., which agreed to pay
$6 million $7 million. He would not identify the other two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling seems to raise questions about whether the firms that
did settle should have done so. But lawyers familiar with the
litigation say some of the companies, particularly Merrill Lynch,
were sued on other grounds as well as the one rejected by Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say that Thursday's ruling will make it harder for the
county to reach lucrative settlements with the roughly dozen other
brokerage firms it has sued. Still, the county does have other
arguments it can use against some of these brokers. The county has
also sued Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., the credit rating agency that is
a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.; Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, a bond
underwriter, and Brown &AMP; Wood, a law firm. Taylor's ruling is
expected to have little bearing on these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Securities, a New York-based unit of Japan's Fuji Bank,
played a relatively minor role in Orange County and decided not to
settle because it thought it did no wrong, Simon, the company's
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Fuji ever did was respond to bids from the county,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the reverse repurchase agreements, the county sold securities
to brokers and agreed to buy them back in the future, usually in
less than 180 days. It then invested the proceeds from the sale in
riskier but higher-yielding securities, hoping to make a profit
even after subtracting the costs of the reverse repurchase
agreement.

HIGH STAKES FOR NORTHRIDGE, MONTANA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ A season won't be made by a win, but a loss
could be catastrophic. The winner sits atop the Big Sky Conference;
the loser tries to save a season.
</P>
<P>
   The winner plays bigger, more important games in upcoming weeks.
The loser scrambles to re-enter the Division I-AA football playoff
race.
</P>
<P>
   It's still October, but the stakes are enormous as No. 24 Cal
State Northridge hosts Montana State for homecoming today at 3:05
p.m. at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this win to stay on top because if we slip an inch,
it's over with,'' CSUN defensive lineman Levi Line said. ``This
school has never won a Big Sky championship, and we want to make
history. We have the team. . . . We can't slip an inch, or it's
going to be sayonara.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (4-2, 3-1 Big Sky) is in this position because of last
week's slip _ no, make that a plummet _ against league doormat
Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   The smarting of a 35-21 loss to the Hornets still exists, and it
has served as the motivation for a hard-hitting week of practice.
But it did more.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat also stripped the Matadors of their first-place
cushion, of having the luxury of a slip up. And it re-opened the
conference race, allowing Montana State (4-2, 2-1) and Weber State
(5-2, 3-1) to creep into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the repercussions that have made this the most
important game at CSUN since the team moved to Division I-AA in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a great shot at winning a championship, we need to win
this week,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``It's the simple fact
that if we win (our remaining league games), we're the champs. It's
a nice position to be.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next three weeks, CSUN plays its closest three
competitors in the league. After the Bobcats leave, CSUN travels to
Utah to play No. 17 Weber State next week before finishing the home
portion of its schedule against Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State plays Northern Arizona, Eastern Washington and
Montana in the upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to lose this game, be at Weber State beating
them in the fourth quarter and saying, `What's the score of the
Montana State game?' '' CSUN strong safety Vito Clemente said. ``We
don't want to be waiting around to see what other people do for us
to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN can take a big step in precluding that scenario by beating
the Bobcats. That is also a problem. The Matadors are 12-8 since
joining the league in 1996 _ including victories in their last
seven conference games _ but are winless in two tries against
Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at Bozeman, the Bobcats blew open a close game in the
fourth quarter of a 31-20 victory. It was not just the loss that
was painful, but (begin ital)how(end ital) CSUN lost: throwing five
interceptions, giving up 228 yards rushing and allowing a 91-yard
kickoff return after they had cut the deficit to 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   Some Matadors even remember 1996, when Montana State beat CSUN
21-20 at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago they came in here and beat us. That hurt,'' CSUN
wide receiver Aaron Arnold said. ``It was our homecoming, they beat
us and we played bad. It seems like every time we play them we find
a way to lose. Last year we had five turnovers, and if anyone
watched the film they know we should have won.''

NEWCOMERS TO NEVADA COULD DETERMINE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `a') 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ From the observation deck of the Stratosphere Tower,
1,149 feet above the glitzy casinos on the Strip, dozens of green
fingers can be seen on the outskirts of town, sticking out into the
brown desert valley.
</P>
<P>
   These are new communities in the fastest-growing part of the
fastest-growing state, and they are the battleground for one of the
tightest Senate races in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these communities did not exist in 1992 when Sen. Harry
Reid, D-Nev., who is running for a third term, was last elected. By
some estimates, 40 percent of the potential voters in Nevada this
year were not here six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign, is running in
this area, historically a Democratic stronghold, for the third time
in four years, having been sent to Congress to represent Las Vegas
and most of its suburbs in the Republican sweep in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who these people are and how they will vote: That is the
question everyone is trying to come to grips with,'' said Billy
Vassiliadis, an advertising executive and lobbyist, who is said to
have one of the savviest political minds in the state.
</P>
<P>
   So Reid, who has raised more than $4 million, began widespread
television advertisements in April, early for a candidate here, to
introduce himself to the newcomers. ``The real challenge for me in
this race is the 400,000 new people,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   And Ensign, who has nearly $3 million, has spent weekends
knocking on doors in these outlying communities. The experience
convinced him, he said, that the new voters, many of them retirees
who left Southern California for a place with a similar climate,
cheaper houses and lower taxes, were conservatives sympathetic to
his politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates and the handicappers say the race is too close
to call. The opinion polls are inconclusive, in part because nobody
knows who will vote.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican leaders say they must win this seat if they
are to have any hope of gaining five seats for a 60-vote,
filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Reid calls Ensign a conservative extremist. Ensign calls Reid a
tax-and-spend liberal. Neither characterization does justice to
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   In style and philosophy, said Jon Ralston, publisher of a
political newsletter here, they are ``polar opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 58, has a high-pitched voice and a pasty complexion. He
has held office most of his adult life, beginning with a term in
the Nevada Assembly. But he is an awkward campaigner, and in his
one televised debate with Ensign often became tongue-tied. Ralston
calls him ``charismatically challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reid is a skillful legislator who will probably become his
party's whip, the No. 2 post in the Senate leadership, if he is
re-elected. He takes credit for legislation important to Nevadans,
including a bill that prevents states from taxing the pensions of
retirees who move to other states.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Reid has
arranged for Nevada to receive an ever larger share of federal
highway money. And he has used his influence to block a plan
favored by Republican leaders to create a nuclear waste depository
at Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's emphasis on the issue forced Ensign, to his considerable
embarrassment, to cancel a campaign appearance by Sens. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, two of the party's sponsors of
the Yucca Mountain measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seniority,'' Reid tells audiences, ``puts Nevada on par
with the larger states.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's positions _ for gun control and more spending on social
programs, and against big tax cuts _ are in line with most other
Democrats. But he favors outlawing a late-term abortion procedure
that opponents call partial-birth abortion and supports a proposed
constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. He
endorsed a Republican proposal, never adopted, to use 10 percent of
the budget surplus for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign, 40, is tall, tanned and handsome, charming on the
campaign stump and formidable in debate. ``Ensign definitely has
the advantage when they are side by side,'' said Steven Parker, a
political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign used his alliance with Speaker Newt Gingrich to win a
seat on the House Ways and Means Committee, a rare assignment for a
freshman, and he quickly mastered the intricacies of tax and health
legislation. But as a junior representative, he has not had the
same opportunity as Reid to put his stamp on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign has generally voted with his party's conservative
leadership, but he broke with them in 1996 to to support an
increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Ensign tells his audiences, his ability to work
with Republican leaders would be more valuable than Reid's
seniority.

   No one knows how the scandal involving President Clinton will
affect the race. A Democratic poll this month showed that Clinton
is seen in a worse light by voters here than he is nationally. Only
38 percent of Nevadans said they had a favorable opinion of the
president, while 49 percent had an unfavorable view.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign has called for the president to resign. But he does not
bring up the matter unless he is asked, and he is rarely asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has called the president's activities ``immoral.'' But Reid
says that voters know that he is married to his high school
girlfriend, has five children and six grandchildren and does not
share Clinton's ``predilections.''
</P>
<P>
   If Reid wins, it will almost certainly be because of women's
votes. Polls show that among women, he leads Ensign by 10 points or
more. He is being helped by several women running on the Democratic
ticket, particularly the candidate for governor, Mayor Jan Laverty
Jones of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Ms. Jones, who began far behind, is drawing
close to her Republican opponent, Kenny Guinn, a retired business
executive and school superintendent who has been campaigning for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   This election could mark a turning point in Nevada politics.
Twenty years ago, Democrats had a 7-1 advantage in voter
registration. Now the Republicans have a slight edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as truly a generational contest,'' said
Vassiliadis, the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense here that Harry Reid is a real player who gets
things done,'' Vassiliadis said. ``He's up against a congressman
who's seen as a hot political prospect, a new breed. This is a test
of the direction this state is going in.''

NEWCOMERS TO NEVADA COULD DETERMINE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also filed in category `p') 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ From the observation deck of the Stratosphere Tower,
1,149 feet above the glitzy casinos on the Strip, dozens of green
fingers can be seen on the outskirts of town, sticking out into the
brown desert valley.
</P>
<P>
   These are new communities in the fastest-growing part of the
fastest-growing state, and they are the battleground for one of the
tightest Senate races in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these communities did not exist in 1992 when Sen. Harry
Reid, D-Nev., who is running for a third term, was last elected. By
some estimates, 40 percent of the potential voters in Nevada this
year were not here six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign, is running in
this area, historically a Democratic stronghold, for the third time
in four years, having been sent to Congress to represent Las Vegas
and most of its suburbs in the Republican sweep in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who these people are and how they will vote: That is the
question everyone is trying to come to grips with,'' said Billy
Vassiliadis, an advertising executive and lobbyist, who is said to
have one of the savviest political minds in the state.
</P>
<P>
   So Reid, who has raised more than $4 million, began widespread
television advertisements in April, early for a candidate here, to
introduce himself to the newcomers. ``The real challenge for me in
this race is the 400,000 new people,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   And Ensign, who has nearly $3 million, has spent weekends
knocking on doors in these outlying communities. The experience
convinced him, he said, that the new voters, many of them retirees
who left Southern California for a place with a similar climate,
cheaper houses and lower taxes, were conservatives sympathetic to
his politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates and the handicappers say the race is too close
to call. The opinion polls are inconclusive, in part because nobody
knows who will vote.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican leaders say they must win this seat if they
are to have any hope of gaining five seats for a 60-vote,
filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Reid calls Ensign a conservative extremist. Ensign calls Reid a
tax-and-spend liberal. Neither characterization does justice to
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   In style and philosophy, said Jon Ralston, publisher of a
political newsletter here, they are ``polar opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 58, has a high-pitched voice and a pasty complexion. He
has held office most of his adult life, beginning with a term in
the Nevada Assembly. But he is an awkward campaigner, and in his
one televised debate with Ensign often became tongue-tied. Ralston
calls him ``charismatically challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reid is a skillful legislator who will probably become his
party's whip, the No. 2 post in the Senate leadership, if he is
re-elected. He takes credit for legislation important to Nevadans,
including a bill that prevents states from taxing the pensions of
retirees who move to other states.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member of the Appropriations Committee, Reid has
arranged for Nevada to receive an ever larger share of federal
highway money. And he has used his influence to block a plan
favored by Republican leaders to create a nuclear waste depository
at Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Reid's emphasis on the issue forced Ensign, to his considerable
embarrassment, to cancel a campaign appearance by Sens. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, two of the party's sponsors of
the Yucca Mountain measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seniority,'' Reid tells audiences, ``puts Nevada on par
with the larger states.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's positions _ for gun control and more spending on social
programs, and against big tax cuts _ are in line with most other

that opponents call partial-birth abortion and supports a proposed
constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women. He

 MONTEREY, Tenn.: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the other side was Looper, a candidate who, even before the
events of this week, seemed in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tennessee, he was a student at West Point until a knee
injury forced him to take an honorable discharge in 1985, the
Associated Press reported. He moved to Georgia, where he ran
unsuccessfully for the state Legislature at 23. He was a
legislative aide, then reportedly lived for a while in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   He won his job as tax assessor in what many people here
described as a a negative campaign two years ago, promising to
fight for lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But quickly his career was marked by accusations of scandal,
including charges that he had offered tax breaks to land developers
in return for political contributions. The accusations led to
Looper's indictment in March on charges of theft and misuse of
office _ charges he denied. He is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   When one developer turned down his offer, the indictment said,
he increased a tax assessment on the developer's parents.
</P>
<P>
   He is also being sued by a former girlfriend who said he
fathered her baby and once tried to transfer ownership of her home
to himself by faking a deed.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release after the woman filed suit, Looper said she
``left me with heart palpitations, a small box of memorabilia and a
red G-string.''
</P>
<P>
   His manner bothered many here. ``His attitude was that we're all
dumb, and he was here to save us,'' McBroom said. He talked down to
Democrats, and promised favors to his Republican constituents,
people here said.
</P>
<P>
   He fired employees and insulted co-workers, courthouse workers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was the smart one, but he kept getting caught,''
McBroom said.
</P>
<P>
   Looper said he was being persecuted because he was a Republican,
in a county dominated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Finding people to speak up for him is hard. One woman in
Cookeville acknowledged voting for him, but begged not to have her
name used in connection with him.
</P>
<P>
   His race for the state Senate seemed to make no sense. He ran
unopposed in the primary, because state Republican Party officials
did not believe anyone could unseat Burks. The party did not
endorse Looper because of his history, state party leaders said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, but unlikely, that he could win.
</P>
<P>
   Write-in candidates almost always fail, but voters said this is
an unusual case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she will win,'' said Phillips of Mrs. Burks, who has
had little to say publicly about her campaign. The voters, Phillips
and others here said, will vote their broken hearts, and their
outrage.

ANNE KLEIN SAID TO BE FOR SALE, WITH NAME AS BIGGEST DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The women's sportswear maker Anne Klein &AMP; Co. is up
for sale, and despite the fact that the company has been losing
money for several years, its lucrative product licenses and
well-known brand name would make it an attractive acquisition,
fashion industry analysts and executives said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives estimated that Anne Klein might be
worth $50 million to $75 million. Others said that the high value
of its licensing businesses could lure a suitor willing to pay even
$100 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have is a tremendous brand name,'' said Bud Konheim,
chief executive of Nicole Miller. ``Everybody knows about Anne
Klein and respects it as a label.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``their brand loyalty has slipped over the last few years,
they have tremendous distribution and a classy product,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein has been struggling for several years and is
estimated to be losing $15 million to $20 million a year from its
clothing lines. But its licensing agreements are providing income
of about $12 million a year and have sales of about $300 million,
industry executives said. The company receives licensing income
from a number of products, including handbags, shoes, watches and
hosiery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great potential,'' said Eli Tahari, chairman of
Tahari Ltd., a New York-based bridge sportswear design company
interested in acquiring the company. ``They have great licensing
income. That alone makes them a company that has great
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein is owned by Tomio Taki and Frank Mori, who also
co-own Donna Karan International. Before starting her own company,
Ms. Karan was the hand-picked successor to the designer Anne Klein,
who died of breast cancer in 1974.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although company officials declined to comment, those believed
to have been approached about purchasing the company include Tahari
and Arthur Levine, who owns Kasper ASL Ltd., a leading maker of
women's suits. A third company, Los Angeles-based Azteca Production
International, headed by Hubert Guez, is also interested in buying
the company, industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Azteca, a jeans manufacturer, is considered a strong candidate
because analysts say they believe it has a lot of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasper makes sense as a good fit, Konheim said, adding: ``It
is known for suits. Anne Klein gets them into sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Anne Klein, Kasper president Gregg Marks said:
``They have made a big turnaround, and their product looks
wonderful. We're a successful company and we're always looking for
ways to increase shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein stunned the industry in April 1996 when it closed its
designer collection and said it had lost $25 million since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has been plagued by problems
stemming in part from not having a widely recognized and
distinctive look to its clothing, fashion experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been a revolving door for designers, none
of which has successfully revived the overall line.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company has hired two designers, Isaac Franco and Ken
Kaufman, from rival Emanuel, and has changed the name of its core
bridge collection from Anne Klein II to just Anne Klein.
</P>
<P>
   And the fall clothing line and a new advertising campaign
featuring well-known women politicians, executives and athletes
wearing its clothes have been well received.

   STUTTGART, Germany _ The next S-Class, the luxury flagship of
Mercedes-Benz, will be 500 pounds lighter and loaded with high
technology. The imposing slab-sided styling of the current car will
give way to a striking, smoother design that Mercedes says will be
the most aerodynamic car on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The new model, to go on sale in March as a 2000 model, is lower,
shorter and narrower, yet it has more usable interior room.
</P>
<P>
   With the next S-Class, Mercedes will have completed the
transformation of its lineup to cars that are lighter, livelier,
better equipped and more aggressively priced than their
predecessors. This strategy has paid handsomely, with U.S. sales up
56 percent so far this year, on top of a 35 percent gain for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   North American versions of the S-Class will come with two V8s
that meet ultra-low emissions standards: The S430 has a 4.3-liter
engine with 275 horsepower, and the S500 has a 5-liter power plant
that turns out 302 horsepower. The six-cylinder S320 will no longer
be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The S500 will have xenon-gas headlamps, heated seats, napa
leather upholstery and burled walnut inlays; the S430 will have
eucalyptus trim, with most of the other items available as options.
</P>
<P>
   Every S-Class will have a five-speed automatic transmission;
anti-lock brakes; traction control; the ESP anti-skid system;
electronic brake assistance (which provides maximum braking force
in panic stops), and electronic brake proportioning (which prevents
the rear wheels from locking up). Also new are 14-way-adjustable
power seats; air bags in all four doors; a side ``air bag curtain''
that deploys from the headliner to stretch across the side windows,
and rear head restraints that rise automatically when a passenger
is present. The Baby Smart system deactivates the air bags if it
detects the use of a child seat.
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive option coming in the second half of 1999 is
Distronic, a cruise control that uses Doppler radar to monitor the
car's proximity to the vehicle ahead. When the cruise control is
on, if the vehicle in front gets too close, the system gradually
cuts engine power. It then applies up to 20 percent of the car's
braking force to maintain a certain distance _ which the driver can
set _ between the S-Class and the vehicle ahead. The system worked
flawlessly in a test drive on a German Autobahn, and seemed
perfectly natural after a few minutes snugged up behind another
car.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has returned to an air suspension, similar to that of
the old 300 and 6.9 models, but it says this one is more robust and
more reliable. Jointly developed by Bosch and Mercedes, it keeps
the ride quiet while adjusting for the weight of a load.
</P>
<P>
   Controls for the Mercedes-Bosch navigation system, the stereo,
the air conditioning and the telephone have been integrated into a
cathode-ray-tube system in the dashboard, with a control button
just below; the TV screen tells the radio station you're listening
to, the CD track you have selected, the telephone number you have
dialed, and information about the climate control _ even where you
are, where you are headed and how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has not announced prices, but hints that even with the
additional features, the new S-Class will be less than the current
car, which begins around $75,000.

METS CLOSE TO SIGNING PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A one-day record of 44 players filed for free agency
Friday, but none of them was named Mike Piazza or Al Leiter. The
New York Mets' catcher and No. 1 pitcher may never file because the
Mets appear to be close to signing them.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official with knowledge of free-agent negotiations
said he understood the Mets were close to reaching agreement with
both players, and a friend of Piazza said, ``It looks like Mike is
coming back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips declined to discuss his
negotiations with agents for Piazza and Leiter, but said, ``There
are no guarantees from anybody, but the fact that they haven't
filed gives me some hope that they feel we're proceeding in the
proper direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The official agreed with that assessment but also cautioned that
until there are agreements, the players could still decide to test
the market by filing for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although no precise negotiating numbers were mentioned, the
baseball official said the Mets' offer to Leiter was close to $32
million for four years, which is what Leiter had sought. The friend
of Piazza said the Mets were talking close to the $94 million
neighborhood for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Any average annual figure over $12.5 million, which is what
Pedro Martinez earns pitching for the Boston Red Sox, would make
Piazza the highest-paid player in baseball, at least until a free
agent like Randy Johnson or Kevin Brown signs. Piazza rejected a
six-year, $84 million offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   As close as they seem to be with their two players, the Mets
apparently are not close to agreeing to a trade that would bring
Bobby Bonilla back to them. Bonilla was rumored Friday to be
returning in a trade with the Dodgers for Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of a National League club said the Dodgers shopped
Bonilla during the World Series and specifically offered him to the
Mets for Rojas, a relief pitcher the Mets would like to shed. Kevin
Malone, the Dodgers' new general manager, was in Montreal when
Rojas pitched there.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, however, have not jumped at the swap, the executive
said, because Phillips is not convinced he wants to have Bonilla
come back to New York, where he developed a questionable image when
he played the infield and outfield for the Mets from 1992 through
July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bonilla on Friday in a conference telephone call
with reporters, Phillips said, ``It's not appropriate to talk about
players on other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' new manager talked about Bonilla, with whom he
feuded when both were in Baltimore in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some differences about the DH,'' Davey Johnson said in
Los Angeles, where he was unveiled as the Dodgers' new manager. ``I
had some young outfielders that I wanted to give a chance to play
early. Bobby had struggled DHing. He is very active and hyper, but
he went on to drive in over 100 runs and hit .300. Then he signed a
$24 million contract, so I don't think it had any adverse effect on
Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that he loved Bonilla, a switch-hitter, and said:
``We need his left-handed bat in the lineup. I don't think there's
any problem between me and Bobby now.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, said the executive who told about the Dodgers'
trade proposal, is that neither Johnson nor the Dodgers like
Bonilla and they want to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piazza and Leiter did not file for free agency Friday,
Mets relief pitcher Dennis Cook did. Of the seven members of the
Mets who are eligible to become free agents, Phillips said the
club's priority was to sign Piazza, Leiter and Cook, but he added,
``We have not closed the door on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Mets eligible are Carlos Baerga, Lenny Harris, Tony
Phillips and Armando Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips initiated talks with Piazza's agent, Dan Lozano, in Los
Angeles last Wednesday. ``I think it was a very productive first
meeting,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager said he thought the Mets were aided in their
quest to retain the catcher because he ``significantly enjoyed the
last part of his year here.'' After joining the Mets on May 22,
Piazza batted .349 with 23 home runs and 76 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he has heard that Leiter, a 17-game winner with a
2.47 earned run average in 1998, would like to stay in New York,
``but I've also heard Al would like to test the market.'' Leiter,
who turned 33 Friday, said Wednesday that chances were 50-50 he
would sign with the Mets without testing the market. &QL;

USC DUCK HUNTING AT RIGHT TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ If you believe Paul Hackett, USC meets ``the best
team'' in the Pacific-10 Conference when the Trojans face
12th-ranked Oregon at Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although his comments earlier this week raised the ire of
college football observers _ not to mention crosstown rival UCLA _
Hackett would probably like to prove himself wrong when the Trojans
play their biggest game of the season today.
</P>
<P>
   For if Oregon really is better than No. 2-ranked UCLA, and the
class of the Pac-10, than the Trojans would appear to be in big
trouble this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for USC, few agreed with Hackett's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (5-1, 2-1) gave UCLA all they could handle last
weekend, but they appear to enter this game with a broken wing.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon lost its marvelous tailback, Reuben Droughns, for the
season after he broke an ankle against UCLA. Droughns was leading
the country with 7.4 yards per carry when he suffered the injury,
and led the conference with 164.8 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Just as vital, the Ducks lost tackle Marco Aguirre (knee) during
the UCLA game, and have been forced to reshuffle their line.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the mental effect the 41-38 overtime loss had on the
Ducks, and there appears to be several major questions entering
this contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to predict what will happen to a team that
clearly played a great football game and lost in overtime, and . .
. the loss of their runner, you just don't know because they
haven't been through that yet,'' Hackett said. ``This team, this
year, has not had to deal with that. They now have to play without
their great runner. How much will that affect them? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks held a team meeting Thursday, because coach Mike
Bellotti felt the team was still moping during practices this week.
</P>
<P>
   A cause for alarm? Perhaps, but the Ducks are still solid
seven-point favorites over the Trojans (5-2, 3-1), who will be
playing in a sold-out Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They still have quarterback Akili Smith, an experienced
offensive line and several eager running backs _ including Taft
graduate Jerry Brown _ eager to fill Droughns' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to run the football to be effective,'' Bellotti said.
``I have confidence that as a group, they will succeed and handle
it. We may not run exactly the same plays we did with Reuben, but
those guys actually have better speed. Brown and (Jason) Cooper are
two of the fastest guys we have in pads.''
</P>
<P>
   USC may not have Oregon's injury problems, but the Trojans have
plenty to worry about. USC has not played in Eugene since 1993, and
no current player has ever faced the Ducks here.
</P>
<P>
   The players did gain some confidence from last weekend's 42-14
victory over Washington State, which at least showed they can win
in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst will start, but he will
be relieved by Carson Palmer, and everyone will be watching to see
if Van Raaphorst experiences the nausea attacks that have bothered
him during three games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who had his longest stint of the year after replacing
the ill Van Raaphorst last weekend, is hoping for another early
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be a little more comfortable,'' Palmer said. ``I
didn't know what to expect last week. It went by so quick. Normally
games take forever. I think I'll be settled in this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Ducks are the ranked team, the Trojans also view
this game as a chance to keep their own long-shot Rose Bowl bid
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose again to have a shot at the Rose Bowl,'' wide
receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``Obviously, we have to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   With USC's offense mired near the bottom of the Pac-10 stat
charts, it will once again be up to the defense. The Trojans shut
down Washington State, but no one confuses the Ducks' graceful
attack with Washington State's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, USC needs to concentrate on containing Smith, without
letting any of the running backs go crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chris Claiborne said he's decided to start pushing
his teammates, as the game's continue to magnify in importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the game starts, if a guy messes up on a play, there's
certain things you have to let the guy know so he doesn't do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Smith) gave us fits last year. It's a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sophomore Antuan Simmons will start in place of Ken
Haslip at cornerback. . . . Hackett decided to practice at Autzen
Stadium on Friday afternoon, after all. He had considered canceling
the walk-through because the offensive line has been nicked up. &QL;

SCELZI SERVES NOTICE IN POINTS CHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By John Sturbin 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ Reigning Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi served
notice last night that he will be running on full-kill for the rest
of the 1998 National Hot Rod Association season.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi went into qualifications for the 13th annual Revell
Nationals at the Texas Motorplex trailing Cory McClenathan by 11
points. Only three races remain on the schedule, and one way to cut
into the points lead is to set a national record. That is worth an
additional 20 points, and Scelzi put himself halfway there with his
second-round qualification run.
</P>
<P>
   Driver of the Team Winston dragster, Scelzi covered the
all-concrete Motorplex quarter-mile in 4.538 seconds and 303.84
mph. Scelzi's elapsed time was a track record and earned him the
provisional pole. The ET was also one-thousandth of a second under
the national record of 4.539 seconds set by Joe Amato in March at
Houston Raceway Park. According to NHRA rules, Scelzi must run
within 1 percent of his first pass _ 4.583 seconds _ to rewrite the
record and claim the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the show. And we'll be on full-kill from here to
Pomona,'' said Scelzi, referring to the season-ending Winston
Finals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway next month. ``There's no
alternative. We're trying to get back in the lead, and win races.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi's blast relegated Kenny Bernstein, the first-round
leader, to No. 2 at 4.585 seconds and 319.71 mph in the Budweiser
King Dragster.
Funny Car
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Pedregon says his Funny Car does funny things on the way to
covering a quarter-mile in less than five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bull. It tries to buck you out there,'' Pedregon
said. ``But when it's humping around in the middle \Rof the run\S
and gets squirrelly, I know it's on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon nailed the provisional pole for the 13th annual
National Hot Rod Association Revell Nationals with one of those
runs, a blast at 4.839 seconds and 317.90 mph. Both numbers set
Motorplex track records. It was also the third-quickest elapsed
time in NHRA Funny Car history _ all recorded by the man known as
``The Cruzer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon has the national record of 4.819 seconds, set in March
1998 at Houston Raceway Park in Baytown.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon's second-round effort last night knocked Whit Bazemore,
who had posted a career-best elapsed time of 4.891 seconds at
309.70 mph, off the provisional pole in the Team Winston Chevrolet
Camaro Z/28. Bazemore had moved from 21st and last in the field to
first before Pedregon put the Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand
Prix on the point.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief ``Wes Cerny never predicts if the car will be
aggressive,'' Pedregon said. ``Only twice has he told me, `Hang on,
it's going to have the front end up and it's going to be dancing
around.' That was in Houston when we set the national record, and
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, the 1992 Winston world champion, will be seeking to
lock up his 11th pole of the season today during the final two
rounds of qualifications.
Leaders midpack
</P>
<P>
   Points leader John Force, the seven-time Winston world champion,
stood 10th on the 16-car ladder after a pass of 5.013 seconds at
300.50 mph in the Castrol GTX Ford Mustang. Force leads Ron Capps
by 47 points in the title chase.
</P>
<P>
   Capps suffered through a miserable two rounds that left him 13th
overall. Capps put up a best lap of 5.214 seconds at 253.73 mph on
his first pass despite a broken blower that destroyed the engine of
his Copenhagen Camaro Z/28.
Hoover joins the club
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon session, veteran Tom Hoover became the 16th
and final member of the Castrol 4-Second Club with his first
four-second pass. Hoover, driver of the Pioneer Electronics Dodge
Avenger, ran 4.93 at 296.7 mph.
