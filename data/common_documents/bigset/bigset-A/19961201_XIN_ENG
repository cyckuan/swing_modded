<HEADLINE> Sudan Optimistic About Postponement of UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudan was optimistic about
the results of the discussions the U.N. Security Council is going
to conduct during the one-month postponement of the
implementation of the U.N. resolution 1070.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's Vice-President Mohammed Saleh made the remarks in an
exclusive interview with the local daily Akhbar Al-Youm, which was
published today.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said Egypt's current coordination with France and Russia
in this connection is in favor of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that we would not be punished for a crime
we did not commit," Saleh stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "if the final decision comes against us,
we will be ready for any emergency."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued resolution 1070 on August 16,
which calls for imposing an air embargo on Sudan by the end of
November this year for its failure to hand over the three
suspects allegedly involved in the attempt on Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, last year.
</P>
<P>
On November 23, however, the U.N. postponed the implementation
of the resolution until the end of December due to a
French-Russian request that offers the Security Council an
opportunity to assess the consequences of the implementation of
the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Russia's New 'Concordsky' Returns to Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tu-144LL, a modified and
upgraded version of Russia's "Concordsky" supersonic passenger
jet, returned to the skies near Moscow at the weekend, carrying
hopes for future Russian-United States cooperation in supersonic
aviation.
</P>
<P>
The design of the Tu-144LL used to be a Cold War secret in the
great race for technical supremacy. Now, an advanced version of it
is being used by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) and the Russian Tupolev Design Bureau as an
experimental aircraft in their joint program to develop a second
generation of supersonic airplanes.
</P>
<P>
At the Zhukovsky Flight Research Center outside Moscow, one of
Russia's military airfields, the Tu-144LL successfully zoomed into
the sky at about 13:30 Moscow time (10:30 GMT) on Friday.It was
the first stage in a series of test flights aimed at aiding the
design of the "plane of the future."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that this so-called supersonic flying laboratory
will complete a series of 32 flights within a period of six
months, testing structural, thermal, acoustic and aerodynamic
effects of flight at more than twice the speed of sound, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
They hope to obtain enough data from the flights to enable
them to begin work on the development of an aircraft which could
cross the Pacific or the Atlantic in less than half the time of a
modern subsonic aircraft, and carry up to 300 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-144LL is a modified and upgraded version of the
"Concordsky" -- the first Soviet passenger supersonic jet which
flew between Moscow and Alma-Ata, now capital of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
An earlier model crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973, killing
13 people and seriously deflating the pride of the Soviet
Union. The technologically and financially troubled program was
put on ice in 1978, although some planes continued to be produced.
</P>
<P>
This successful half-hour test flight of the Tu-144LL
"describes what the next generation of supersonic aircraft will
probably look like," said Robert Witcofski, a senior NASA
engineer. The U.S. space agency is using the Tu-144LL for its high
speed research program, after a long search for a suitable
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this project is not only important to America (the
United States) and Russia, but for the world as a whole," declared
Russ Barber, NASA's project manager.
</P>
<P>
"The jet may begin flights in 2006," Tupolev chief designer
Alexander Pukhov told a reporters after the Tu-144LL test flight.
He predicted the world's airlines would need about 500 such jets
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, NASA's news release stated that "the international
economic stakes are high." It predicted sales would exceed more
than 200 billion U.S. dollars, and have the potential to create
"140,000 new jobs in the United States," easily making the
10-million-dollar investment by U.S. companies such as Boeing Co,
McDonnel Douglas and General Electric worthwhile. The Russian
contribution is about one-third of that.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the formerly highly respected Russian aviation
industry is crumbling as it struggles to adapt to the new
conditions of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
This industry used to receive its orders and money from the
state, developing military jets. Now partially privatized, it can
no longer depend on the government for regular income, and as it
attempts to convert to a market in which civil aircraft are in
greater demand than military aircraft, it is discovering that its
technology is far behind that of the West, the experts
say. Moreover, the industry needs more money for further
development.
</P>
<P>
As state support has dried up, the jobs of millions of aviation
workers are in the balance. Tupolev, for instance, has been forced
to lay off 6,000 workers since 1991. Many of its 9,000 remaining
staff had not been paid since May, the Moscow Times said.
</P>
<P>
The fading light of the Russian aviation industry became all
too obvious when workers demonstrated before the test flight,
demanding payment of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
"We hope international projects such as this will help us get
out of the deep crisis," declared Valentin Klimov, Tupolev's
General Director.

<HEADLINE> Russian Interior Troops to Guard at Chechen Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian interior troops will
guard the administrative borders of Chechnya after completing the
pullout from the breakaway republic, Russian Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov said today.
</P>
<P>
"Additional measures are necessary in order to prevent
the 'export' of arms, drugs and criminals from Chechnya," Kulikov
said. He was speaking at a session of the Military Council of the
Interior Ministry's troops.
</P>
<P>
The interior troops are due to be completely withdrawn from
Chechnya by the beginning of next year under a decree signed by
President Boris Yeltsin last week to ensure peaceful presidential
and parliamentary elections in Chechnya scheduled for January,
1997.
</P>
<P>
But the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament,
urged Yeltsin Friday to reconsider the decision, noting that the
move may only help Chechnya gain independence from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China, India Should See Further Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Both China and India should
deal with bilateral relations in their strategic perspective,
visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who went to
Jiang's residence to see him off, that his visit turned out to be
"very smooth and successful".
</P>
<P>
The Indian president said Jiang's visit will promote the
development of Indian-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting held on Thursday, Jiang and Sharma
exchanged views on many issues in an atmosphere of friendship and
frankness, as described by the Chinese visitor.
</P>
<P>
"Consensus has reached especially on the establishment of a
constructive and cooperative partnership," said the Chinese
president who is to leave New Delhi on Sunday for Islamabad to
continue his visit.
</P>
<P>
The conception of the constructive and cooperative partnership
has pointed out the direction for the development of bilateral
relations in the future, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He cited a sentence from an old Chinese poem that says one has
to climb up higher if he aspires to see farther as the guideline
for Chinese and Indian leaders dealing with bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China and India signed on Friday an agreement on the
confidence-building measures along the line of actual control in
the Sino-Indian border areas.
</P>
<P>
The accord is hailed as conducive to solving the border issue
which is left over from history.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers Continue Protest Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece has remained cut in two
for the second successive day today with tractors blocking major
highways after hours-long negotiations Friday night between the
government and farmers brought no result.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have set up roadblocks at several points on the main
Athens-Salonika motorway, the main road artery linking the
northern and southern parts of the country, as well as at
junctions in central and northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are demanding higher prices for their products, lower
production costs through cheaper diesel, fertilizer, seeds and
electricity, the reduction of value added tax to 8 percent on farm
equipment and the settlement of debts that cooperatives owe to the
state-owned Agriculture Bank, which come to about 1.3 billion u.s.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary to the Prime Minister's Office George
Paschalidis had lengthy talks with farmers' representatives in
Larissa, central Greece, Friday night, but farmers warned that
they would continue their protest action until Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers' coordinating committees were scheduled to
meet today and Sunday to discuss joining the protest action.

<HEADLINE> MCI, Following At&AMP;T, Will Raise Long-Distance Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 30 (Xinhua) -- MCI Communications Corp., the
second largest telecommunication company in the U.S., will raise
long-distance rates, following the move of the industry's giant,
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported here today that MCI filed with the
Federal Communications to boost rates 4.9 percent on Sunday. AT&AMP;T
said it will raise basic long-distance rates by 5.9 percent, also
starting Sunday, to cover increased costs for customer service and
for enhancing its phone network.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as the two companies prepare for competition
from regional Bells, which penetrated the long-distance market
worth 70 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Sprint Corp., another major telecommunication provider, raised
rates by 2 percent earlier this month. AT&AMP;T's rate increase could
raise the average phone bill of a customer by 60 cents a month,
the company said Wednesday.

40,000 refugees believed to be inching north along the Rwandan
border.
</P>
<P>
-- Diplomats from more than a dozen countries met in Ottawa and
gave the formal go-ahead to an international relief mission that
could air lift food to refugees in eastern Zaire if it proves
necessary.
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Values In Britain Reach 7-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain are
rising faster than at any time in the past seven years, according
to the latest figures from the Nationwide Building Society.
</P>
<P>
In the year to November, they rose 8.8 percent after going up
1.3 percent in the last month alone. These are the biggest
increases since house prices peaked in May l989.
</P>
<P>
Further evidence of renewed market activity comes with Inland
Revenue figures showing the number of housing transactions in
October at its highest since 1989.
</P>
<P>
This week the Land Registry found that the average value of
transactions it registered in the three months to September was
nearly 5 percent high than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage commitments are running at levels last seen at the end
of l990, suggesting that considerable momentum has built the
recovery in the housing market.
</P>
<P>
Bank of England figures show that demand for mortgage finance
is having a powerful impact on the economy and has been
accompanied by strong growth in demand for consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts warned Chancellor Kennth Clarke, who
announced the last budget before election next May on Tuesday that
the economic recovery could run out of control if the house market
gathered too much momentum.
</P>
<P>
However, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke made clear in his Budget
briefings that he would not hesitate to raise base rates if he
thought the economy was overheating.

<HEADLINE> Countries Agree to Canadian-led Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian-led multinational
humanitarian mission to eastern Zaire has been formally approved
by ambassadors from 14 countries here.
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead was given by representatives of 14 participating
countries at a meeting Friday, which was chaired by Paul
Heinbecker, Canada's assistant deputy foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
"Now the multinational force is formally constituted,"
Heinbecker was quoted as saying by today's newspapers here.
</P>
<P>
In all, about 20 countries are expected to contribute to the
multinational force, which is likely to be made up of 1,000 to
2,000 soldiers instead of the 10,000 initially planned.
</P>
<P>
The scaled-down mission comes nearly three weeks after Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien began talks with other world leaders
to help an estimated million or more refugees from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many refugees have returned to Rwanda. However, at
least 100,000 are still in eastern Zaire, Heinbecker said.
</P>
<P>
The force, based in Entebbe, Uganda, under the leadership of
Canadian Lt.Gen. Maurice Baril, will carry out reconnaissance to
determine where the refugees are and how best to get food to them.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Baril and his people are going to be on the spot and they are
going to make an assessment," Heinbecker said.
</P>
<P>
Steps are being taken to begin consolidating about 500 Canadian and
U.S. military personnel deployed at Entebbe into a formal
multinational headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Three Canadian Forces C-130 Hercules transports now in Entebbe will
begin moving relief supplies closer to distribution points in the
Great Lakes region, said the Canadian Department of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
However, a decision as to whether the force will begin airdrops or
seek to move supplies over land has not been taken.
</P>
<P>
Dropping food from the air - which has been criticized as
unworkable by some - is not the best option but may be only way to
distribute supplies, Heinbecker noted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian military has said airdrops could begin early next
week.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Industrial Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's industrial output
increased by 10.8 percent in October this year compared with the
same period a year earlier, the National Statistical Office (NSO)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that South Korea's monthly industrial
output registered a two-digit expansion over the same period of
the previous year since January when it grew 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSO attributed the robust increase in industrial output to
increased sales of automobiles, office automation equipment and
chemicals, both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The output in the heavy and chemical industrial sector had
achieved a 14.8 percent growth last month while the light
industrial sector suffered a 2.5-percent fall.
</P>
<P>
Factories operated at an average 82.2 percent of capacity in
October, slightly up from the previous month's 81.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale and retail sales had risen for the year by 7.6
percent last month, and the unemployment rate leveled off at the
September rate of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
October's industrial perk-up was temporary and the economic
downturn was likely to deepen in the months ahead, a NOS official
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's economic growth rate this year is predicted to be
6.8 percent, compared with last year's 9 percent, according to the
Bank of Korea, the country's central bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- African countries still
back a second term for the Secretary General of the United
Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made today by Botswana's ambassador to the
U.N. Joseph Legwalla, in Gaborone, the Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported.
</P>
<P>
African countries are now divided over whether or not to
continue to back Boutros-Ghali's bid for re-election as the
U.N.chief.
</P>
<P>
Cracks have emerged after the United States accused African
states for ''wasting time'' by refusing to come forward with
alternative candidates for the post.
</P>
<P>
Ghana,Ethiopia,Rwanda,Uganda,Burundi,Tanzania and Cote d'Voire
are reportedly among countries saying Boutro-Ghali should step
aside for other African candidates.
</P>
<P>
But so far a majority of member states of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU) still back the current U.N.chief's bid for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, said
earlier this week that if the Americans continue to oppose a
second term of Boutros-Ghali, Africa should put up alternative
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vetoed Boutros Ghali's attempt to seek a
second term, claiming he has failed to reform the organisation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Botswana has
further relaxed exchange controls, Radio Botswana reported today.
</P>
<P>
The controls previously prevented dual listing of foreign
companies on the Botswana Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, issued recently, registered
stockbrokers are allowed to buy any shortfall or sell any surplus
to other stock exchanges via registered participants in the
market.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme provides permanent residents with an additional
opportunity of investing on foreign companies without using
capital allowances.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the changes investment by an individual company or
institution in a foreign company was viewed as an external
investment and subjected to direct external and portfolio limits.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana stock exchange officials have hailed the move as a
significant step for the future development of the country's capital
market.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Opposition Alliance Seeking To Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition alliance in
Ghana is still searching for a magic formula that would help them
defeat President Jerry Rawlings and his ruling National Democratic
Congress (NDC), only a week to the country's general elections.
</P>
<P>
The center-right New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the center-left
People's Convention Party (PCP) went into an electoral alliance to
contest the December 7 polls, saying that joining together is the best
way of ending Rawlings' 15-year rule, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
However, the two traditional rivals have been feuding openly, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The great alliance was born to bring hope to the opposition which
is hungry for power. But hey have been fighting each other rather than
consolidating this historic alliance," said Alice Nuatro, a secretary
at a government ministry, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
"These people postponed, twice, the launching of their campaign and
have now abandoned the idea. I don't think they are organized," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The lack of cohesion in the opposition may even cost them votes as
people begin to wonder whether they can effectively rule the country
if they win power.
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed at what is happening and i may rather sleep than
vote on election day," George, Obeng, a supporter of NPP, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
NDC Press Secretary Vincent Asiseh even ridicules the opposition
alliance by saying that should they win the polls, they will spend
their time disagreeing rather than ruling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the alliance have been desperately trying to
play down the deep divisions and intransigence which threaten to wreck
the electoral marriage.
</P>
<P>
Although they pointed out that there is absolute peace and
reconciliation at the apex, they have to concede there is a problem at
the parliamentary level where some one dozen seats are still being
disputed by the two parties.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The government has
approved the plan to start a Catholic University of Mass
communication In Mwanza, Northwestern Tanzania, in 1998, accoding
to the official Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the 36th graduation ceremony at the Nyegezi Social
Training Institute (NSTI) in Mwanza today, President Benjamin
Mkapa said, to facilitate the establishment of the university,
the government was considering to hand back the building of the
Nyegezi Agriculture institute to the Catholic Church in Mwanza
and make it as a part of the university.
</P>
<P>
"I have directed the relevant ministry to make a valuation
with regard to the government's property for compensation," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
The building, which is about 10 kilometers from Mwanzan and
was once owned by the Catholic Church and handed to the
government, has been lying iddle after the government closed the
institute last August for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president commended the tireless efforts by the
Catholic Church in promoting social services in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that the church should consider more
gender balance in its institution to back up his government's
efforts to promote gender equality from primary level to higher
learning institution.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the number of female students in higher learning
institutions is now not satisfactory and cited the 1989/90 to
1993/94 intakes where only 15 to 18 percent of the enrolled
students at the Dar es Salaam University were female, 13 to 20
percent at Sokoine Agriculture University, 16 percent at Dar es
Salaam Technical College and only one percent at Arusha Technical
College.
</P>
<P>
During the graduation ceremony 94 graduats were awarded
certificates and diplomas respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Head of State to officiate at a
graduation ceremony at NSTI, which was established over 36 years
ago. enditem

<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here this afternoon for a brief visit to Egypt, during
which he will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the stalled Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to brief Mubarak on the failure of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on Israel's troop redeployment
from the West Bank city of Hebron, the Egyptian MENA agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, fresh from his Gulf tour, would also brief Mubarak on
his visits to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Arafat said in Jericho that no progress was
achieved during the attritional, three-month Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations on the redeployment in Hebron, the last West Bank
town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership had rejected any separation between
the Israeli redeployment and the final-status talks during a
meeting chaired by Arafat Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It insisted there should be links and synchronization between
the mechanisms for the repeatedly-delayed redeployment in Hebron
and for the redeployment in other areas in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
His visit here also coincided with an emergency session of the
Cairo-based Arab League, which was held today at the request of
the Palestinian Authority and Syria to discuss the Israeli
government's settlement activity in Palestinian territories and
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Permanent Representative to the league Mohamed
Sobeih warned that a failure to achieve progress in the ongoing
peace process and Israel's procrastination in the negotiations
with the Palestinians would throw the region into a "climate of
tension and violence."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegate said that Arab and Palestinian people
will not accept anything less than the land for peace principle.
</P>

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu pledged last week
that the Jewish settlements will continue to expand regardless of
the mounting Arab outcry.

BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A four-member team of oil
experts from the British Lloyds, who are in charge of examing the
implementation of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal, today arrived
in Iraq's northern city of Zakho to inspect oil installations
there to prepare for the oil export.

According to the oil-for-food agreement, Iraq is expected to
start some time this month exporting 700,000 to 800,000 barrels
of crude each day within six months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies for its people living under six years

<HEADLINE> Foundation-stone of Chinese Monastery Laid in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The foundation-stone of a
Chinese Buddhist monastery was laid today in West Nepal's Lumbini,
birthplace of Buddhism founder Sakyamuni.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Culture Minister Bal Bahadur K.C., Vice-Chairman of the
Chinese Buddhist Association Ajia Losang Thubten, Chinese
Ambassador to Nepal Zhang Jiuhuan and a top Chinese official for
religious affairs jointly laid the foundation for the monastery,
which is expected to be completed within two years at a cost of
over 4 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-style monastery will be donated by the Chinese
Buddhist Association under an agreement signed in Kathmandu
earlier between the association and the Lumbini Development Trust
of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the foundation-stone laying ceremony, Ajia, leader
of a visiting Chinese Buddhist delegation, said the construction
of the monastery, originally proposed by the 10th Panchen Lama
and Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association Zhao Puchu, will
further enhance the friendship between the two countries , carry
forward the good traditions of Buddhism, and contribute to peace
in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for China to build a monastery in a
foreign country and the monastery will be a great event in the
history of Sino-Nepalese friendly relations, Ye Xiaowen,
director-general of the Bureau of Religious Affairs under the
State Council of China, said on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Ye is in Nepal at the head of a 10-memebr Chinese officials
delegation to attend the centenary celebration of the rediscovery
of Ashoka Pillar in Lumbini, about 150 km west of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The 1896 discovery of the Ashoka Pillar, which was erected by
an ancient Indian emperor to mark the birthplace of Sakyamuni,
proved Lumbini the birthplace of the Buddhism founder, or the
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The celebration program was inaugurated earlier today by the
Nepali culture minister amid a grand ceremony. The Nepali
government expects the nearly one-month-long celebration will help
promote Lumbini as a major pilgrim destination for Buddhists from
foreign countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nesim Tumkaya, representative
of the United Nation's Population Fund, has expressed his concern
about the situation of HIV/AIDS in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in connection with the World's
AIDS Day here today, Tumkaya said that although Pakistan was not
as seriously affected by HIV/AIDS as some other countries, there
was a real danger that it might become so since the spread of
infection has already started.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1,033 persons infected with HIV, and 64 full
blown cases of AIDS in Pakistan. However, on the basis of
scientific methods, it is estimated that 50,000 to 80,000 persons
actually carried virus in the country, according to Tumkaya.
</P>
<P>
Tumkaya, also chairman of UNAIDS, said that UNAIDS and its
partners in Pakistan have looked at the problem with great concern
and have accordingly agreed to double their efforts to help the
national AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
The UN agencies have been joined by the Embassy of Norway,
which has committed a significant amount of financial resources
for these efforts, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
rated bilateral ties with Pakistan as "all-weather" during his
meeting today with Pakistani Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj
Khalid.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here on a four-day state visit, said that it
is because China and Pakistan have always abided by the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence that bilateral relations have
stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
He told the former Pakistan National Assembly speaker that his
meeting earlier in the day with President Farooq Ahmed Khan

The Pakistani caretaker prime minister said Pakistan and China
respect and support each other and enjoy a sound cooperative
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Khalid, who succeeded Benazir Bhutto as the country's prime
minister, has visited China many times and served as the principal
of the International Islamic University prior to becoming the
caretaker prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Khalid told the Chinese visitor that he has been focusing on
bolstering Pakistan-Chinese friendship since the 1950s and that he
was very glad to meet Jiang today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said President Leghari's comment on the
relations between the two countries reflects the thought of the
Pakistan people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's visit, the fourth by a Chinese president
to the country, will further promote bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> China, Pakistan to Forge All-Round Cooperative Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China and Pakistan reached an
agreement today to forge a 21st-century-oriented, all-round
cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was struck between visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari
during their two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "China and Pakistan are close friends and their
friendship is honored by time."
</P>
<P>
The ups and downs in the international arena have never held
sway over bilateral relations, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president cited as a proof of strong ties Jiang's
state visit. "Though Pakistan has undergone government reshuffle,
the Chinese president came to visit as scheduled, which attests to
the solid friendship built up on a sound basis," he said during
the presidential meeting which was overtime by half an hour.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president dismissed Benazir Bhutto from her post
as prime minister in early November.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Pakistani peoples, Jiang said, have established
mutual understanding, trust and support through their long history
of friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have coordinated and cooperated well in
international affairs apart from fruitful cooperation in politics,
trade, economy, culture and military affairs," added the Chinese
president.
</P>
<P>
He went on to describe the two countries as friends who have
gone through thick and thin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added: "The Sino-Pakistani friendship serves as a model
for countries with different ideologies and social structures."
</P>
<P>
Leghari hailed the friendly relations between the two countries
as a contribution toward regional and global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president visited China in 1994 while Jiang is
the fourth Chinese president to visit this country. Former
Chinese presidents Liu Shaoqi, Li Xiannian and Yang Shangkun
visited Pakistan in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "The Sino-Pakistani friendship was forged by the
older generation of state leaders of our two countries and the
friendship has withstood historical trials.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are duty-bound to maintain and further this traditional
friendship."
</P>
<P>
Leghari agreed with Jiang's remarks and added that
Pakistani-Chinese relationship is the cornerstone of his country's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the wish of the Pakistani people to forge a
21st-century-oriented cooperative partnership as well as to
maintain friendly and fraternal ties with China.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president also said his country is willing to
develop friendly relations with other South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that South Asian nations can resolve their disputes
through peaceful negotiations so as to develop and promote the
economy in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Leghari exchanged views concerning regional and
international issues including that of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president hoped that a compromise can be achieved
among Afghanistan's ethnic nationalities by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that his country has always appealed
for a peaceful solution to the Afghanistan issue. He added the
Afghanistan people are capable of solving their own problems.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong,
Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering, Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, Special Assistant Wang Weicheng,
Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Gyaincain Norbu and
Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid.

<HEADLINE> Russia Marks 100th Anniversary of Zhukov's Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russians leaders laid wreaths
this morning at a monument to former Soviet military leader Georgi
Zhukov near the History Museum in central Moscow to mark the 100th
anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, head of the presidential administration Anatoly
Chubais, Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, parliament leaders and
war veterans.
</P>
<P>
The main commemorative activities in the capital city, devoted
to the jubilee of the great military leader who became
world-famous during World War II, were staged several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
The name of Zhukov is connected with a number of the pivotal
battles of the war.
</P>
<P>
He successfully carried out the first Russian offensive
operation in the first months of war to defeat the striking Nazi
army group in the area of Yelnya, some 300 kilometers southwest of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Zhukov shouldered responsibility for grueling battles against
the German fascists at approaches to Leningrad (now St.
Petesburg) and during the Battle of Moscow where Nazi Germans
suffered the first major defeat.
</P>
<P>
He coordinated actions of Russian fronts in the Battle of
Stalingrad (now Volgograd) which inflicted a staggering blow on
the Nazis. The military leader masterminded the Kursk-Oryol Battle
which broke the backbone of the German military machine.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet marshal signed the act of capitulation of
Nazi Germany in May 1945.
</P>
<P>
Zhukov enjoys a popular love in Russia and in other former
Soviet republics as well.

LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of children left
behind by AIDS victims in Zambia stands between 500,000 and
600,00, the Zambia News Agency (ZANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report came amid functions organized since the weekend in
the country to mark the world AIDS day.
</P>
<P>
An anti-AIDS drive is going on in Zambia to raise people's
consciousness about the deadly disease. Paintings are seen in
streets, roadsides in both urban and rural areas all over the
country, saying "AIDS/HIV cannot be cured but can be avoided".
</P>
<P>
At an ecumenical candle light service at a church in Lusaka at
the weekend, President Frederick Chiluba said that the society
should reform and change its life styles and the use of condoms
was not enough to be an answer.
</P>
<P>
He urged political leadership and those in high positions in
other sectors to stand and work as one to try and find ways of
combating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank of Zambia Governor Jacob Mwanza has called on
all business houses in the contry to establish a foundation to

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up County Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Increasing farmers' incomes
should top the agenda in programs to develop the county economy.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Tieying said this Saturday, when he
addressed a national conference on the reform of the county
economy. He stressed that the reform must focus on arousing
farmers' enthusiasm and protecting their interests.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of agriculture and the rural
economy as a whole, as well as the increase of farmers' incomes,
should be the priority in the reform process.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the Chinese population live in thousands of
rural counties, with most people engaging in farming.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product is
turned out by counties.
</P>
<P>
Volume of county retails accounts for 50 percent of the
national total and the county industrial output value accounts for
more than 50 percent of the country's total, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Li, also director of the State Commission for Economic
Restructuring, recommended that bolder measures be adopted in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Clear Away Mountain of Alkali Residue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A huge hill formed of waste
from alkali factories in this north China port city is to be
cleared soon.
</P>
<P>
The hill, containing three million cu m of residue, occupies a
600-sq-m area between the Tianjin Port Bonded Zone and the Tianjin
Economic Development Area.
</P>
<P>
A development company in the city plans to use the residue as
foundation material for a new bonded warehouse zone nearby.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in China that such an operation has
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
The project, to cost 80 million yuan (about 9.6 million US
dollars), will help develop 1.4 sq km of land and save more
than two million cu m of loess soil.
</P>
<P>
Disposal of the waste, which encroaches on land and pollutes
the environment, is a problem that has plagued the chemical
industry for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Alkali Plant has discharged 15 million tons of such
waste over the past 80 years.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been discovered that the waste is superior to
that of loess soil for filling purposes in construction.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years Tianjin plans to develop more than 30
sq km of coastal marsh, which will need 40 million tons of earth
for filling.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, experts say, the utilization of alkali residue will
result in considerable economic and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city intends to remove another two huge piles of
such residue over the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Individually-owned and private
businesses are booming in this east China metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest city today has a total of 51,600 private
economic entities, a rise of 11,800, or 29 percent over the number
last year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 550,000 people were employed by individually-owned
businesses this year, 200,000 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly increasing numbers and expanding scale are two
important characteristics of the development of the private
sector, which boasts nearly 30 billion yuan in registered capital.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government attributed the booming of private
businesses to the fewer workers needed by the textile and
electrical equipment industries.
</P>
<P>
More than 760,000 people are now self-employed in the city,
one-fifth of the number employed in state-run enterprises and
government institutions.

<HEADLINE> Red Ribbon To Draw Concern About AIDS in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Red Ribbon Center, an
education forum on AIDS, will come into operation here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Red ribbon is the international symbol for concern about
HIV/AIDS and people infected with the fatal disease. One of the
main objectives of the center is to promote community
participation in AIDS education and research, said a spokesman for
the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
The center was developed by the Department under the
sponsorship of AIDS Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
"It also aims at facilitating social, behavioral and
epidemiological research on HIV/AIDS in Hong Kong and Asia, and to
 enhance international collaboration in the fight against
HIV/AIDS," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The new center, rather than a treatment center, is composed of
an information center, an exhibition area, a library and a
resource unit providing support to small non-governmental
organizations working on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the center is part of the activities to mark the
World AIDS Day, which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
The number of HIV carriers has consistently gone up in Hong
Kong since the first AIDS case was reported here 15 years ago. The
latest figures provided by the Department of Health show that now
there are 228 AIDS cases reported and 738 persons diagnosed as
HIV carriers in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Aidid Imposes Taxation in South Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since the
the late Somali president Mohammed Siad Barre was toppled in
1991, the formal taxation was imposed today by the government of
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Citizens and businessmen woke up in the morning with the
presence of groups of three men, two in police uniform armed with
ak-47s and one from the municipal forces of Hussein Aidid at
their business stalls.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed militiamen are patrolling the main streets of
south Mogadishu, where Aidid gains most of the control.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Omar Mohamed, the Mogadishu governor appointed by
Hussein Aidid, told reporters that the collection of the tax in
the capital will improve the social services in terms of health,
education and sanitary operations by the government.
</P>
<P>
Taxation enforcers include more than 190 municipal forces, 200
policemen and 400 so-called national forces.
</P>
<P>
The tax collection is meeting with opposition in many places
from businessmen, who are either complaining that the tax rate is
too high or preparing arms at their business stalls.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle to the tax operations is at the main Bakara
Market, where hundreds of militiamen are employed to protect
the interests of Somalia's biggest business dealers.
</P>
<P>
According to the businessmen at Bakara Market, the largest
business center throughout the country, they are offering 3,000
Somali Shillings to the militiamen (something close to US dollars
0.40 cents) each day to ensure that they could pay no more money.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no reports about forcing those big
businessmen to pay the tax. Extensive talks are being said to
undertake between officials from the government of Hussein Aidid
and representatives from the business communities.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), as the promotional arm of local companies, will
launch services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it
was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
SMEs, which account for 98 percent of the local companies, form
the backbone of Hong Kong's economy. Their contribution to the
economic boom in the Asia Pacific region is also widely
recognized, said Anna Lai, deputy executive director of the TDC.
</P>
<P>
With the globalization of economic activity and rapid
technological change, SMEs are facing keen competition in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises are usually in a weak position for lack of
resources in research and development and an global marketing
network.
</P>
<P>
That is why the TDC has decided to provide new services for
SMEs, including an industry data bank, an inquiry system, trade
directories, seminars, workshops and training programs. "They
require strong support to continue their success stories," said
Lai.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Prime Ministers Voice Hope for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 1 (Xinhua)-- Both co-prime ministers of
Cambodia today voiced their hopes for stability in the
southeastern Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers made the point as they returned to
Phnom Penh this afternoon from the first informal summit of the
Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which ended
Saturday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh told reporters at the
Pochentong International Military Airport: "We hope that from now
on there will be political stability" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that three countries -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar
(also known as Burma) -- will be admitted as members of the ASEAN
simultaneously next year.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said separately to the press:
"Good -- everything is good."
</P>
<P>
But they did not go into details on the outcome of the ASEAN
summit and any contact between them during the journey.
</P>
<P>
Political tension emerged between the two prime ministers
following the slaying on November 19 of Hun Sen's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
They had verbal conflict with each other before leaving together
for the summit on November 29, mainly over defection of Khmer
Rouge elements and ownership of public land and property.
</P>
<P>
Their joint appearance at the ASEAN summit at last was deemed
to have hinted that the partnership between them could be
maintained.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Premier Criticizes Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti has openly criticized his Israeli
counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu for failing to match his words
with deeds.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti made the accusation in an exclusive interview with a
leading Israeli Hebrew newspaper Ma'ariv, which was published
today.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti charged that Netanyahu tells Jordanian leaders one
thing and does something entirely different.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Netanyahu ought to know that as time goes on,
the Jordanian leaders are increasingly bewildered.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted so much to trust Netanyahu. We gave him every
possible chance... But as time passes, we are becoming more
frustrated and confused. You hear from him one thing and on the
ground you see something else," Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
Both Jordan and Israel attach great importance to the
relations between the two neighbors. Israel reportedly takes
pride in having what it called "warm peace" with Jordan in
comparison with that between Israel and Egypt. The Jewish state
terms its peace with Egypt "cold peace."
</P>
<P>
However, the relations have soured since the rightwing
Netanyahu government opened the Western Wall Tunnel in the Old
City of Jerusalem in September without consulting Jordan
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has since then lashed out at the
hardline policy of the new Israeli government on the
peace process. King Hussein visited the West Bank city of
Jericho in October and expressed strong support for the
Palestinian positions, including the demand for an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti has said that Jordan supports the Palestinian position
on the matter of "hot pursuit" in Hebron or other Palestinian
towns.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Monks Mark Panchen's First Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Monks at the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Lamasery, the seat of the Panchen Lama in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, celebrated Friday the first anniversary of the religious
leader's ascent to the throne and the publication of President
Jiang Zemin's inscription greeting the occasion .
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old Living Buddha was confirmed and approved by
the central government as the 11th Panchen Lama in November last
year, after the traditional procedures for his selection had been
followed.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription last December for a
signboard for the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, which read: "Safeguard
the Country and Benefit the People".
</P>
<P>
Monks in the lamasery recalled the search for the reincarnation
of the 10th Panchen Lama, which lasted for six years.
</P>
<P>
They said that the event demonstrated the Communist Party of
China's policy of freedom of religious relief, and it was a
victory for the Party's policies concerning ethnic groups and
religion.
</P>
<P>
"We must regard President Jiang's inscription as an
encouragement and guidance for us to forge ahead, and as an
important text for spreading patriotism and socialism among both
monks and laymen," said Gayhang, a senior monk at the lamasery, on
behalf of the other monks.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- With the approval of the State
Council, prices for China's postal and telecommunications services
will be readjusted, beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications have jointly issued a circular on the raising
of charges for postage and local urban telephone calls, while
reducing those for international and local rural calls, as well as
for telephone installation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more efforts will be exerted to rectify all kinds of
overcharges for such services.
</P>
<P>
The postage for all domestic ordinary mail letters has been
raised to 50 fen, from 10 fen for local delivery and 20 fen for
other types of domestic delivery.
</P>
<P>
China suffered a six-billion-yuan loss from urban telephone
services last year, while the higher charges for international
calls has slowed down the development of the service.
</P>
<P>
International telephone call charges will be reduced by an
average of 30 percent, while those for urban telephone calls
will be raised by 20 percent. In addition, China will simplify
charges for domestic long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
It will also cut charges for the use of telephones in the
country's rural areas and charges for telephone installation, in a
bid to speed up telecommunications development in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The commission and the ministry also call on all organizations
which provide postal or telecommunications services to clear up
all cases of overcharging and better serve customers by improving
services.

STOCKHOLM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Brian Tobin, President of the
International Tennis Federation (ITF), rejected suggestions by
several American players in Malmo of Sweden on Sunday that the
Davis Cup should be played every two years rather than annually.
</P>
<P>
"Only two or three Americans out of the World's top 50 players
have not played Davis Cup this year. The competition isn't about
these players it's about the 124 countries that participated this
year," Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
America's World number one Pete Sampras and compatriot Andre
Agassi both suggested the Davis Cup be played either every two or
even four years.
</P>
<P>
The two players had complained that the Davis Cup put extra
pressure on their schedules and neither played in their Davis Cup
quarter-final defeat by the Czech Republic this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Tobin conceded that he would be talking with the ATP
tour organisers about arranging the most convenient dates for the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Collectors of antiques and art
works in China are becoming more sophisticated, an expert
commented here today following an auction.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinhui, an appraiser from the famous Rongbao Art Gallery,
said that judging from a series of auctions held here this fall,
China's antiques and art works buyers are now just as numerous and
astute as those from abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended '96 Rongbao Fall Arts And Antiques Auction, 274
of the total 312 pieces were sold, with the total volume of
business reaching 30 percent over the originally expected figure.
</P>
<P>
"One of the outstanding characteristics of this auction was the
important role played by the buyers' increased sophistication,
which could be viewed as a signal of a mature antiques and arts
market," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that buyers now have more scope for choice. "They
have begun to consider the artistry, instead of only paying
attention to the names," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This fall at least four large-scale arts and antiques auctions
have been held here, with a number of records being improved.
</P>
<P>
In October a painting by Fu Baoshi, a leading modern Chinese
painter, was sold at an auction for about 1.3 million US dollars,
an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business at the '96 Hanhai Fall Arts and Antiques
Auction in November was 15.7 million US dollars-worth, also a
record.

BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese health official
announced on the World AIDS Day today that 5,157 cases of HIV
infection, including 133 cases of full-blown AIDS, had been
reported in China by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The figures were 4,305 and 131 cases, respectively, at the end
of August this year, even though experts estimate that China's
actual number of HIV infection cases is between 50,000 and 100,000.
</P>
<P>
"China is undergoing an HIV/AIDS epidemic at present, since the
speed of HIV virus transmission is obviously faster than before,"
Vice Minister of Public Health Yin Dakui told a gathering to
observe the ninth World AIDS Day here.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was attended by health officials, experts and
representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), United
Nations Development Program, European Union and some other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of individuals who have devoted themselves
to spreading knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention among the public
were given awards by the Ministry of Public Health and the China
STD (sexually transmitted diseases) and AIDS Prevention Foundation.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition on STD and AIDS prevention and control was also
opened in Beijing today, as part of a nationwide publicity drive
on the occasion of the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
"One World, One Hope" is the theme of this year's World AIDS
Day.
</P>
<P>
"The theme reflects the worldwide efforts to organize a
rational, enlightened and determined response to the global AIDS
epidemic, and encourages us to be optimistic," said Dr S.T.Han,
the WHO's regional director for the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates that up to June this year the actual number
of HIV infection cases around the world had reached 27.9 million,
including at least 7.7 million cases of AIDS infection, and 5.8
million AIDS patients have died.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that 40 million people will be infected by the HIV
virus and 10 million will develop full-blown AIDS by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
Soon nobody in the world will be safe from the threat of
HIV/AIDS, a UNDP representative said here today.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned of an uncontrolled epidemic of HIV/AIDS in
China if effective countermeasures are not taken immediately, even
though the country still has a low level of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will carry out an overall action plan to
mobilize governmental departments and the whole society to launch
a nationwide campaign against HIV/AIDS, according to officials
from the Ministry of Public Health.

LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria-Sierra Leone
military pact is to be dissolved following the peace agreement
signed Saturday between the Sierra Leonean government and the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the Nigerian "Sunday
Punch" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The truce deal, signed in Abidjan, Cote'Devoire, by President

five-year-old civil war in the west African country, where more
than 10,000 people have been killed, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the truce deal include the demobilization of the
RUF as a movement, the integration of some RUF fighters into the
Sierra Leone national army, intergration of the members of RUF
into the civil society, and the reduction of the army.
</P>
<P>

war has ended because "democracy has returned to Sierra Leone and
good leadership has been enthroned."
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been fixed for the withdrawal of foreign
forces in the country. But it was agreed that the Nigerian, South
African and Guinean troops would be withdrawn in quick phases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Unearth World's Oldest Rice Field in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
announced they have unearthed the oldest paddy field in the world
- dating back 6,000 years - near east China's Suzhou city.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the finding, announced by a Sino-Japanese
research team last month, was believed to be 3,500 years older
than another ancient rice field discovered in Fukuoka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
They are calling it a breakthrough in the research of rice
growing by early human society.
</P>
<P>
Located at the Caoxieshan archeaological site 15 kilometers
east of Suzhou, 33 plots of ancient farm fields, covering a total
of 450 square meters, have been excavated since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The largest was 12.5 sq.m. while the smallest was less than one
sq. m., according to a report on last Thursday by the
Shanghai-based "Wen Bao Daily."
</P>
<P>
A large number of carbonized rice seeds were found dotting the
fields. "The research has proved the seeds were not from wild
plants, but from cultivated rice," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Experts also found an irrigation system had been adopted in the
paddy fields, which were linked by ditches, allowing water to run
through them.
</P>
<P>
"Experts concluded that the fields were also the earlest
irrigated farmland in human history," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Pottery and hook-shaped tools made of deerhorns, also unearthed
from the site, were believed to be used by ancestors to draw water
from nearby wells.
</P>
<P>
"We found the fields were cultivated in the different periods,"
said Ding Jinlong, director of the Archaeological Dept. of the
Suzhou Museum. "This shows that the fields had been used as a rice
production base for a long period."
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta area has been considered the first
rice-growing area in China and one of cradles of the Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
From 1992, the State Cultural Relics Bureau authorized the
Nanjing Museum, Suzhou Museum, Lianyungang Museum and Wuxian City
to take charge of excavation work.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the
Japanese Miyazaki University also carried out the research work.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Technology For China's Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Air Force plans
to adopt advanced aero-technology and study technological
developments used in other countries as part of its effort to help
modernize its own technological standards and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Xin Dianfeng, deputy commander-in-chief of
the Air Force, recently made the remark in the city of Zhuhai at
China's first air and space show.
</P>
<P>
"To promote its modernization, the air force has focused on
expanding information channels, and will follow the latest trends
of aero-technology in the world," the general said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Zhuhai, Xin viewed flight demonstrations by
two fighters developed by Chinese aviation experts, and by the
Russian-made Su27, Su30 and Il78, and observed that a gap exists
between the weaponry used by the Chinese air force and that of
foreign air military forces, especially the electronic and
firearm systems.
</P>
<P>
"The air force must rely on the domestic aviation industry for
further development, instead of relying on the import of
foreign-made warplanes," Lieutenant General Xin said. "However, we
will introduce some advanced equipment and technology to promote
the improvement of our own technological standards and weaponry."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese air force has been equipped with a
group of fighters, bombers and transport planes with improved
air-born weaponry and electronic instruments.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Xin, who is a former pilot, said that all of
the pilots in the Chinese Air Force hold a college degree, and
high-ranking officers, from the commander-in-chief to commanders
of the military regions of the air force, were once pilots.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident in the future of the air force, and
that with the rapid development of China's aviation industry, the
weaponry of the air force will continue to be improved, making it
a strong presence in the world military scene.

number of Taiwan reporters come to the mainland for news
coverage. To date, he added, some 5,000 trips have been made by
Taiwan reporters for news reportage on the mainland, and this has
contributed tremendously to the in-depth understanding and mutual
affections of the people across the Taiwan straits, and more and
more Taiwan compatriots have acquainted themselves with the
mainland's drive of reforms and opening to the outside world.

</P>
<P>
Departments at all levels and in various regions of the
mainland are active in providing easy accesses and assistance to
Taiwan journalists, the offcial said, adding that channels for
news coverage are unimpeded and some Taiwan news organizations
have already their de facto resident offices on the mainland.

The regulations have been formulated precisely for the purpose
of simplifying the procedures, increasing efficiency and providing
better and still more convenient services for Taiwan reporters in
their news coverage on the mainland, the official said.

<P>
Noting that the promulgation of the regulations fully shows the

<HEADLINE> Travelers in Shanghai Provided with More Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Only a year ago, travelers who
wanted to go from Shanghai to Nanjing in neighboring Jiangsu
Province had to wait in line for a train ticket for the 380-km
journey.
</P>
<P>
Now, they can go by either train or bus as soon as they arrive
at the station.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway, a large
number of imported luxury buses are now carrying passengers, who
prefer the easier access and comfortable interior.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from Shanghai Statistical Bureau show that more
and more local residents prefer motor vehicles for short trips and
airplanes for long journeys, rather than trains and boats, the
traditional inter-city means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, 9.88 million passengers took buses
and 4.59 million traveled by air from Shanghai to other provinces
and cities, rising 17.7 percent and 13 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the same time, passenger totals on trains and ships fell
7.7 percent and 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
To attract travelers back, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has
opened more train services, while ship companies are focusing on
expanding special tourist offerings.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A service commitment has been
formulated by Hainan's tourism administration, hotels, travel
services, tourist shops and sites to help protect the interests of
tourists and regulate the tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was signed by representatives from 213 hotels, 237
travel services, 22 tourist shops and sites in the island province
at the southernmost tip of China.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that hotels will grant preferential
prices to travel agencies that have contributed sufficiently to
the tourist guarantee fund, and that standard room fees for
individual tourists and group travelers not organized by travel
services will not be lower than the amount charged to groups
brought in by travel services.
</P>
<P>
Travel services are forbidden from offering unreasonably low
prices as a means of competition, and from contracting business to
individuals. And tourist guides and others working in the industry
are banned from soliciting high sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies are also required to insure travelers against
accidents during tours.
</P>
<P>
Tourist shops and sites must strictly follow a uniform price
standard, and refrain from selling poor-quality and fake goods,
and paying sales commissions to gain more visitors. Tips paid to
tourist guides and drivers should not exceed 20 percent of sales,
and all the fees should be settled by travel services.
</P>
<P>
All of the tourism businesses are under supervision of local
tourism administrations and price control departments, and those
who violate the regulations could face penalties ranging from
fines to being closed down.

</P>
<P>
"The China-Pakistan good neighborliness and friendship based on
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have stood the test of
time and developed steadily, thanks to the joint efforts of the
leaders, peoples and successive governments of our two countries,"
Jiang said in a written statement released upon arrival at the
Islamabad Airport.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Pakistani President Farooq
Ahmed Khan Leghari.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan have regularly exchanged presidential visits
since they established diplomatic relations in 1951. Jiang is the
fourth Chinese president to visit Pakistan after Liu Shaoqi in
1966, Li Xiannian in 1984 and Yang Shangkun in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premiers and Pakistani prime ministers exchanged
official and unofficial visits scores of times in the past 45

times.
</P>
<P>
"The fields of mutually-beneficial cooperation between us are
expanding and fruitful results have been attained therefrom,"
Jiang said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He described the bilateral relations as not only conforming to
the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Pakistani peoples but
also contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability in
South Asia and Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said his visit will strengthen friendship, deepen mutual
understanding and extend mutually-beneficial cooperation, which
will lay a sound foundation for the two countries to bring their
traditional friendship into the next century.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay, Jiang is scheduled to hold talks with
Pakistani President Leghari and caretaker Prime Minister Malik
Miraj Khalid.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president had worked in a factory in Pakistan in
1976 and an old pal reunion is slated for Monday for him to meet
some of his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is also scheduled to deliver a speech on China's
relations with South Asia at the Pakistani senate.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president is to visit Lahore, a major city in
Pakistan, before leaving for Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Jiang on his Pakistani visit are Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong,
Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering, Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, Special Assistant Wang Weicheng,
Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Gyaincain Norbu and

<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin left here today for Lisbon to attend a summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the
formation of a new security model across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
plans to submit to the meeting scheduled for Monday proposals for
"the development of a general and all-embracing model for a Europe
of the 21st century," said sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Russian Premier will once again
voice protest at the meeting against the eastward expansion
efforts by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the heads of state and government of the 54 OSCE
countries is expected to adopt a number of documents of principled
nature on prospects for European security.
</P>
<P>
After a sight-seeing tour of the Portuguese capital after his
arrival, Chernomyrdin will meet Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to examine European security and
questions of bilateral relations, including economic ties between
Russia and Portugal, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Russian national security chief Ivan Rybkin, also Deputy
Chairman of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, arrived in Lisbon on
Saturday for a meeting of the OSCE's governing body today.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin foresaw a difficult dialogue at the governing body
meeting, since it should specify key issues on the eve of the
upcoming summit, an Itar-Tass report quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The main issue, as discussed at the Stockholm session of the
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, is to create an all-embracing system
of security on the continent, Itar-Tass said, adding that the
NATO's expansion plans will also be a difficult topic.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Belarus first participated in international marathon in
April 1995, and this is the second victory since her triumph in
the Las Vegas marathon last February.
</P>
<P>
Li Yemei said the strong wind, measuring between 38 km/h to
47km/h, cost her a back-to-back win.
</P>
<P>
"I felt quite good until the 20 kilometers," she said. "I
planned to improve my record. But my legs felt heavy from the
moment I began to run up a slope."
</P>
<P>
Her coach, Yang Jianxun, told Xinhua that Li had not fully
recovered from the Beijing Marathon last October and that she
could hardly find time for training while studying at Beijing
University.

HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- About 62 percent of Zimbabwean
households are poor and 46 percent of the population lives in
absolute poverty, preliminary results of a poverty assessment
study have shown.
</P>
<P>
The revelation has jerked some concerned Zimbabweans living in
relative comfrot to form a pressure group, the poverty reduction
forum, to lobby for policies aimed at reversing this frightening
scenario, the "Sunday Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the forum Leornard Maveneka said the situation
should not be allowed to continue to slide down. The forum would
be putting pressure on the government, the donor community and
the private sector to make certain policy changes in curtailing
the rate of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year the government released its poverty alleviation
action plan which sought to empower poor communities but its
implementation has been delayed by lack of financial resources.

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh to Shift Water-Sharing Talks to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina and visiting West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu of India
held "very positive and fruitful" talks on water-sharing here
Saturday and the two sides agreed that more discussions on the
issue should be held in Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Hasina and Jyoti, assisted by ministers and officials of their
respective sides, had talks for nearly 90 minutes and met
exclusively for nearly an hour without any aides. After the
meeting, both leaders told journalists that they were hopeful
about the solution of the Ganges water-sharing issue.
</P>
<P>
But according to sources close to the prime minister today, the
differences between the two sides over a 2-year short-term
water-sharing agreement as proposed by the Indian side and the
demand for a long-term agreement by the Bangladeshi side had not
yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
"The Bangladeshi side is not in a position to sign any
agreement which may trigger a lot of commotion among the common
people," the sources said, adding that Jyoti did not say anything
concrete to Hasina about the demand of Bangladesh. But he said he
will visit New Delhi from December 3 and would brief Prime
Minister Deve Gowda on the outcome of his current visit to Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"Every thing would be finalized in New Delhi," Jyoti said while
passing by newsmen after his talks with Hasina.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hasina had planned to visit New Delhi in
the first week of this month to sign a permanent agreement on the
water-sharing issue with her Indian counterpart Gowda.
</P>
<P>
A date for the visit has not yet been fixed, the sources close
to Hasina told the press, adding that she would be visiting India
if something concrete transpired regarding the much expected
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jyoti arrived in Dhaka Wednesday to hammer out an acceptable
solution to the outstanding Ganges water-sharing problem.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar More Prepared Than Laos, Cambodia to Enter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary General Dato'
Ajit Singh said Myanmar is more prepared than Laos and Cambodia to
participate in free trade as envisioned in the ASEAN free trade
area (AFTA) scheme.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, Myanmar is well prepared to enter AFTA. While for
Cambodia and Laos, preparations are going on," he said after
briefing heads of the prospective ASEAN members at the ASEAN
secretariat here Saturday, an official at the ASEAN secretariat
said today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the three countries were invited to attend the
first informal summit of ASEAN held here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Singh said there was still no decision yet to admit Cambodia
and Laos into AFTA at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"I think the decision to admit these three countries will be
taken later, maybe at the end of the foreign ministerial meeting
in July 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN members were discussing the three countries'
preparations to join AFTA, and would hold negotiations with them
about the terms for entry into AFTA and other terms and criteria
set by ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of AFTA is to promote greater foreign
direct investment and intra-ASEAN investment in the region.
Another important aim of AFTA is to promote ASEAN as a competitive
production base geared to the global market.
</P>
<P>
The common effective preferential tariff (CEPT) scheme, which
is the main mechanism for realizing AFTA, was launched on January
1, 1993. The scheme covers manufactured and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The product coverage in the scheme is the most comprehensive
ever in any ASEAN trading arrangement.
</P>
<P>
At an ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in Jakarta last
September, six ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) agreed to lower their import
tariffs starting in 2003 while the association's seventh member,
Vietnam, agreed to do the same in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The first informal summit of ASEAN held here Saturday decided
that  Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar will be admitted as ASEAN's
formal members simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The actual timing of the admission of the three countries will
be announced in due time, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
said on Saturday after the summit meeting.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Round of SAARC Trade Negotiations Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The second round of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) trade
negotiations concluded here Saturday with member countries
pledging to allow preferential entry for more products into their
markets.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the SAARC secretariat here,
trade officials from SAARC members agreed to increase the number
of commodities for preferential treatment from the current 226 to
1,500.
</P>
<P>
The step was another important milestone towards trade
liberalization in the region after the South Asian preferential
trade arrangement (SAPTA) came into force one year ago, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka and the Maldives -- hope to launch a South Asian free
trade area (SAFTA) preferably by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to sources attending the negotiations, India, the
largest economy in the region, has alone offered preferential
entry to about 900 items on the expanded list.
</P>
<P>
The agreed tariff concessions on these items would range from
10 to 15 percent, an Indian trade official said.
</P>
<P>
The national schedules of concessions finalized and adopted at
the Katmandu meeting will be considered by the SAARC Council of
Ministers, which is scheduled to meet later this month in Delhi,
India, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Closes Down Chernobyl's No.1 Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine completely closed down
one of the two working reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant at 10 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the No.1 reactor started at 8:30 a.m. as
scheduled. Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said Friday that it
would never be used again.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said another reactor, or No. 2 reactor, which closed
five years ago, would be restarted before the end of 1997 to ease
the energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernobyl, about 140 kilometers from Kiev, is one of the five
nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Its fourth reactor exploded in
April 1986, sending radioactive cloud across much of Europe. It is
now enclosed in a concrete sarcophagus, while the No. 2 reactor
was closed after a fire in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 and No. 3 reactors which continued operation generated
11 billion kilowatts of electricity every year, which was one
fifth of the country's generated energy.
</P>
<P>
Fearing another nuclear disaster, the Western countries urged
Kiev to completely close down Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Group-7 and the European Union signed a
memorandum with Ukraine, demanding Ukraine entirely shut down
Chernobyl by 2000. The G-7 pledged to give 3.1 billion
U.S. dollars and technical support to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In May, Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety Minister
Uri Kostenko announced that Ukraine would shut down the No. 1
reactor in 1997. But due to the pressure of the West and technical
problems, Kuchma decided to shut it down this year.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace asked the G-7 to help Ukraine speed up
the construction of the Roveno and Khmelnitsky nuclear power
plants, which could ease Ukraine's energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the No. 1 reactor could actually work up to
2007. Its closure could cause Ukraine a loss of 4.5 billion
kilowatts of electricity every year, and throw many people out of
work. The closure of the fourth reactor in 1986 made 2,000 people
jobless.

</P>
<P>

of the visit and was confident that guided by the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India, the
good-neighborly and friendly relations and mutually-beneficial
cooperation between the two countries will continue to solidify

Before President Jiang's departure, Indian Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda went to the presidential palace where the Chinese
president stayed during his Indian trip.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda said good-bye to President Jiang and
saw him off at the airport.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Cancer-Curbing Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Canada's
University of Calgary have discovered a gene that curbs the growth
of several cancers, the newspaper Globe and Mail said today.
</P>
<P>
The finding has immediate implications for diagnosing the
presence of a cancer and appears to have a potential for treatment
in humans, said Dr. Karl Riabawol, a medical researcher with the
university.
</P>
<P>
Known as ING-1, the gene is a tumor suppressor and is active in
healthy cells, producing a substance that controls growth. In
cancer cells, it is shut off or mutated, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The gene was first discovered when normal breast cells were
compared with breast tumor cells. And the same result has been
seen in five other types of human cancer.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory experiments show that active ING-1 genes stopped the
growth of each of these types of cancer cells, Riabawol said.
</P>
<P>
The next step in the research will be to understand what
factors turn off the gene, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine GNP Grows Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy, driven
by the recovery of the farm sector and high remittances of
overseas workers, grew 7.1 percent in the first nine months of
this year, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest GNP figure is almost two percentage points higher
than the 5.3 percent GNP growth recorded in the same period last
year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the reports, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito
Habito said he expected the gross national product to sustain its
robust growth in the last quarter despite the slowdown in
electronics exports, the country's main foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Habito said gross domestic product (GDP) -- the total value of
goods and services produced by the country -- rose 5.4 in the last
three quarters of the year, up slightly from the 4.9 percent a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter alone, GDP grew by 5.9 percent, while GNP
-- defined as the sum of the GDP and the net factor income from
abroad -- rose by 6.8 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito said this year's GNP growth was fueled by the recovery
of agriculture, the large amount of money sent home by overseas
construction workers, and the vigorous construction,
transportation and telecommunications sectors.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Finance Ministry to Limit ODA Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry has decided
to limit the increase in official development assistance (ODA) in
the fiscal 1997 budget to a record low of around 1 percent over
the previous year due to severe financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun said today the ministry will reflect the
austere ODA policy in the budget to be drafted by the ministry
around December 20 for the next fiscal year starting next April.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to hold down growth in budgetary
appropriations for ODA and other programs in fiscal 1997 as the
starting year for financial structural reform.
</P>
<P>
But the Foreign Ministry is demanding as a "bottom line" a 2.6
percent ODA increase, as specified in a ceiling set for budgetary
requests this summer, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ODA has been the largest in the world for the past
five years.

<HEADLINE> Thai Interior Minister Declares War on Narcotics Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Thai Interior
Minister Sanoh Thienthong Saturday declared a war on the trade in
illicit drugs, especially amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
"The drug-smuggling problem is undermining the country in worse
way than would a war from outside. I am determined to take action
in this issue in three to five months, and the results have yet to
be seen," Sanoh was quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamine abuse, which was once common among manual workers
and long-haul truck drivers to keep them awake so they could work
longer, has lately become a fad among students and teenagers.
Addicts high on amphetamine have also committed several violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh threatened to take both legal and disciplinary actions
against any government officials found to be involved in
amphetamine dealing.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh said his deputy, Chalerm Yoobamrung, would play a key
role in the anti-drug task. As a former police captain he had
highly pertinent skills which could be applied.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicines to Bring Hopes to AIDS Patients (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese herbal medicines will
bring hope to the anti-AIDS campaign, but China's pharmacologists
should gather more evidence about their effectiveness before major
breakthroughs in the field can be announced, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully convinced that China's traditional herbal
medicines can contribute significantly to global AIDS control, if
we continue conducting rigorous and scientific research on it,"
said Kang Laiyi, director of the Shanghai Municipal AIDS
Surveillance Center.
</P>
<P>
Outcome from animal experiments, cytological research and
clinical use conducted by a research group led by Kang show that
an AIDS medicine named "XQ-9302" has been proved to be partially
effective as a treatment for AIDS, Kang told Xinhua in a telephone
interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The medicine was found to generally improve the immune systems
of animals, while having neither long- nor short-term toxic
effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinical use of the medicine on several AIDS patients showed
that their symptoms have been clearly alleviated and the functions
of their immune systems are resuming, he said.
</P>
<P>
The HIV virus, which causes AIDS, has not appeared in the
patients' blood, and the antigen P24 has disappeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
Results from clinical experiments using the medicine have been
published in the London-based "AIDS Analysis" Journal and the
"Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases."
</P>
<P>
"Although we're still detecting HIV RNA (ribonucleic acid) in
the patients' blood, the medicine has shown the sign of having a
curative effect on AIDS," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should make further studies and establish more
convincing facts before we reach the final conclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the National Prevention and Control Committee of
AIDS Experts, Kang called on Chinese pharmaceutical researchers to
develop a still more serious, conscientious attitude toward
conducting accurate AIDS drug research using herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, "we should keep a tight control on medicine
quality, conduct cytological and clinical experiments and
establish detailed observation indexes."

<TEXT>
<P>
Kang said that successful results of herbal medicines used to
treat AIDS will have a great impact on the world, especially in
developing countries where 90 percent of AIDS patients live and
inexpensive but effective medicines are needed.
</P>
<P>
The 11th International Conference on AIDS has urged countries
and regions to focus on developing herbal medicines and
traditional medicines to treat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Third International Drug Research Conference, held in
Britain's city of Birmingham early last month, announced some
encouraging new achievements in AIDS medicine research.
</P>
<P>
Scientists announced that patients who took more than three
kinds of anti-reverse transcriptase enzyme activity medicines, or
used them together with protase inhibitor medicines, showed
reduced levels of the HIV virus in their blood, and their symptoms
were eased.
</P>
<P>
"The blood level of HIV virus reduced by 99.9 percent six
months in these patients after they took the medicine," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
"However, those medicines will cost a patient more than 10,000
US dollars each year," he said, "so developing effective but
affordable AIDS medicines has become a new task."
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates that there are more
than seven million AIDS patients in the world; and 75 percent of
them have died.
</P>
<P>
China reported a total of 4,305 HIV infection cases by the end
of August, including 131 patients with full-blown AIDS. And
eighty-six AIDS patients in the country have died.

<HEADLINE> Sinopec Strides Forward with Wider Teamwork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's petrochemicals giant
Sinopec is stepping into the 21st century with ambitious plans and
a strategy of deepening reform and strengthening international
cooperation, today's "China Daily" quoted Sheng Huaren, president
of the China Petrochemical Corp., as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec has enjoyed a speedy growth over the past decades, with
annual production accounting for about 80 percent of the country's
total in the field. It is expected to win 25.9 billion US dollars
in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
But the domestic growing petrochemicals industry still cannot
match the soraing market demand stemming from the nation's rapid
economic growth and its huge population, said Sheng.
</P>
<P>
In order to build petrochemicals into a pillar industry of the
country, China has set a target of increasing annual crude-oil
processing capacity to 220 million tons and ethylene-cracking
capacity to five million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
And by 2010, the two sector's figure is expected to rise to 300
million tons and 10 million tons, respectively, a big leap from
210 million tons and 2.94 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To turn the production targets into reality, Sinopec is to
reform its administration and increase links with overseas
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, more of Sinopec's subsidiaries will be put
on the domestic and overseas capital markets as Sinopec continues
transforming itself into a share-issuing corporation.
</P>
<P>
It will give priority to introducing advanced technology from
abroad and increasing cooperation with big overseas companies in
technology development and personnel training, said Sheng.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec has already established technology cooperation with big
companies and institutes, such as ABB-Lummus, Stone and Webster,
Unocal, Honeywell, IFP, Chyoda and the ENI Group.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its 147 joint ventures by 1995, Sinopec is
currently engaged in talks with BASF, BP, Exxon, Amoco, Dow
Chemical and Phillips Petroleum over the feasibility of jointly
building world-class and hi-tech petrochemical bases.
</P>
<P>
It also wishes to broaden international co-operation in
financing, and expand cooperation with large overseas contractors
in bidding for big petrochemical projects at home and abroad, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sheng noted that Sinopec will go on playing a crucial role in
external trade in the petrochemical field.
</P>
<P>
Despite the expected growth of China's domestic petrochemical
industry, he added, Chinese imports of raw petroleum are likely to
keep the rising momentum during the 1996-2000 period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Honor Founding Anniversary of China Radio International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng have written words of encouragement for China
Radio International (CRI) on the occasion of its 55th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Jiang wrote, "Voices reach the five continents and make friends
all over the world."
</P>
<P>
And Li penned, "Develop the external radio broadcasting and
promote friendship and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
A new building for China Radio International will soon be put
into use in the western suburbs of Beijing, turning a new page in
the radio service's history, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The international radio service was initiated on December 3,
1941, when the Xinhua Radio Station in Yan'an started a Japanese
language program, the first external radio service in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 55 years, generations of CRI radio personnel have
informed their listening audience about the War of Resistance to
Japan (1937-1945), the War of Liberation (1946-1950), new China's
socialist construction and reform and opening to the outside world
during its new period.
</P>
<P>
The radio service for overseas audiences has also made
important contributions toward creating a good image of China in
the international arena, promoting the mutual friendship and
understanding between the people of China and the rest of the
world, safeguarding world peace and the cause of promoting the
progress of humanity.
</P>
<P>
To date, the service broadcasts worldwide in 38 foreign
languages, as well as the standard Chinese (or Putonghua) and its
four local dialects for a total of 192 on-air hours each day.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it received 500,000 to 600,000 letters from
listeners in some 180 countries and regions annually, and has over
2,000 listeners organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The service is among the world's top influential radio media,
boasting the most foreign language services and audiences, and
covering the widest broadcasting area among China's external
service-oriented media organizations.
</P>
<P>
With its language service, broadcasting hours and number of
audience letters received, it ranks among the world's top three
radio services.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President-Elect Wants OAS Mission to Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan president-elect
Arnoldo Aleman has asked the Organization of American States (OAS)
to extend the mandate of its mission in his country for six
months, Liberal Alliance said today.
</P>
<P>
Aleman made the appeal for fear of an eventual outbreak of
violence between his Liberal Alliance and the leftist
National Liberation Sandinista Front, which was defeated in the
October 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the OAS mission expires in December.
</P>
<P>
Aleman defeated his main rival, Sandinista leader Daniel
Ortega, in the election, but negative campaign of both sides
raised fears of right-left violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas charged the Liberal Alliance with "a
(Anastasio) Somoza-type fraud" in the elections, and called the
future Arnoldo Aleman government "a rotten fruit."
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas also played up Aleman's links with backers of
Somoza, the late dictator, during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
But OAS and European Union observers of the election said the
vote had been legitimate and asked all parties to accept the
results.
</P>
<P>
Aleman also called for reconciliation immediately after his
victory.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary Sandinistas overthrew dictator Somoza in
1979, fought U.S.-backed Contra rebels and ruled the country for
11 years until it lost power in an election to outgoing President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The OAS International Commission for Verification and Support
(CIAV-OAS) arrived in Nicaragua shortly after de Chamorro assumed
presidency in April, 1990 to oversee the peace process at the end
of the war between the Contras and the Sandinista forces.
</P>
<P>
The Chamorro government had been able to extend the CIAV-OAS
mandate three times.

SAN JOSE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's coffee export
dropped by 8 percent in the first 10 months of this year compared
with the same period of last year.
</P>

It earned only 332.1 million U.S. dollars in the period under

Foreign Trade Minister Jose Rossi blamed the reduction to the
fall of coffee prices in the international market, saying those
are causes "completely out of our control."
</P>

Costa Rica is one of the world's most important coffee
exporting countries with an annual production of 900,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Kunshan Attracts Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The output value of
Sino-foreign joint ventures in Kunshan of Jiangsu Province
surpassed seven billion yuan (84.3 million US dollars) in the
first nine months of this year, making up half of the city's total
industrial output value, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The city government has taken measures to strengthen the
introduction of foreign funds and guarantee the fruitful operation
and production of the joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Kunshan has focused on the
development of precision machinery, chemical products, electronic
appliances and advanced building materials when introducing
foreign investment. Its foreign investment mainly came from the
United States, Canada, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of this year, 130 joint ventures
involving total investment of 310 million US dollars were
established in Kunshan.
</P>
<P>
Overseas partners in the joint-venture projects include
world-famous enterprises such as Toyota and Hitachi of Japan,
President Foodstuffs Group of China's Taiwan Province, Alcatel of
France and Hoechst of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures in Kunshan cover one-third of the city's total
industries, bringing high-tech items including transducers,
numerical-control machine tools and plasma sickles to the city.

<HEADLINE> 349 Million US Dollar Transport Corridor to Link Shenzhen, HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A 349-million-US-dollars
transport project, called the Western Corridor, is soon to be
built to link Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China's
Guangdong province, and Hong Kong, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The project, near Shekou Industrial District, includes a
4,910-meter highway bridge across the sea, a new land port and a
five-kilometer six-lane highway and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is extremely urgent for the future
prosperity of both cities, is expected to be completed within
three years, the paper quoted Wang Xiuhe, chief engineer of the
Shenzhen-Hong Kong Western Corridor Construction Preparatory
Office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study has been completed and geologic studies
are underway in Shenzhen. The central government has agreed to
send technicians to Hong Kong for investigations, which have
received a positive response from Hong Kong departments.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong will certainly push forward the construction of the Western
Corridor," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Four Hong Kong Companies and several international consortia
have expressed interest in financing the project, which is
expected to recoup initial investment in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 8.5 million automobiles passed through the present
three land ports between Shenzhen and Hong Kong -- Huanggang,
Shatoujiao and Wenjindu, which were designed to handle 32,000
vehicles per day and has become inadequate under growing traffic.
</P>
<P>
Some 68,000 vehicles are expected to commute between the two
cities per day by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that expansion of the current three ports has been
vetoed by municipal authorities because of concerns over
pollution: the three are close to downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
The new project will also help Hong Kong maintain stable
economic growth and strengthen its role as an international
transport centre, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> B Shares Surge Reflects Brighter Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The recent surge in the B-share
market reflects overseas investors' confidence in bright prospects
for China's economy, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
But the experts noted that liquidity of B shares will remain
weak under segregation of the A-share and B-share markets, unless
the renminbi becomes fully convertible.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, China's B-share market has made a big
leap, sparked by the headway of Shenzhen's steam-roller B-share
market.
</P>
<P>
After dipping to a record low of 44.8 points on November 11,
the Shanghai B-share index scored a nearly ten-point rise within
days. Shenzhen B shares registered a pickup of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Daily turnover of B shares on China's two bourses totalled as
high as 550 million yuan (66 million US dollars), compared with a
couple million yuan before the surge.
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Huangshan Tourism has enjoyed big gains after listing
on November 22 - in sharp contrast with its predecessors, which
were regularly sold below their initial offering.
</P>
<P>
Many stock market experts believe a turning point has come for
the till-recently bearish B-share market.
</P>
<P>
"The surge reflects investors' recognition of China's
achievements in macroeconomic adjustment and the promising
prospects of a new economic cycle," Wang Boming, executive
vice-president of the Stock Exchange Executive Council, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Figures released since the later part of this year confirm that
China has succeeded in achieving a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the forthcoming return of Hong Kong to the motherland
also reinforces investors' optimism.
</P>
<P>
Since the government twice reduced the interest rate this year,
funds have flushed into the stock market, pushing stock indices
both in Hong Kong and the mainland to record highs.
</P>
<P>
The feeble B-share market, soured by the discouraging results
of companies' interim performance, has drawn energy from the rosy
environment.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the surge of B-share prices should not be a
surprise in view of their due values.
</P>
<P>
Compared with A shares, B shares are always remarkably
undervalued and do not conform to the performance of the listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Many B shares, such as Erfang, Yongsheng and Chlor Alkali, are
traded at prices only 20 or 30 percent of their initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
The price-earning ratio of B shares could be as low as five or
six, compared with 20 for some A shares.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said, since the B-share market is limited to
foreigners -- most of whom have limited knowledge of China's
policies and development, the market is bound to see slower
trading and poorer liquidity than the A-share market.

<HEADLINE> Fax Market Unfolds Error-Free Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- While welcoming foreign fax
machine manufacturers to participate in domestic production, China
is calling on its own manufactures to move into high gear to win a
larger domestic market share.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts suggest that domestic manufacturers upgrade
quality and capacity through technological co-operation with their
foreign counterparts and by soliciting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Fax machines registered in China are expected to number 900,000
by the end of this year, representing an annual increase of 150
percent from the 89,300 registered in 1992, today's "China Daily"
quotes an official with the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT), as noting.
</P>
<P>
Domestic market demand for fax machines is likely to exceed ten
million by the end of this century, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently only 20-odd fax machine factories or joint
ventures in China, most of which assemble imported parts. Market
analysts say these factories can meet half of domestic demand;
they currently fill less than ten percent of domestic demand,
leaving the rest to imports.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Japanese fax machines including those made by
Matsushita, Canon, Sharp and Toshiba have been flooding into the
Chinese market at retail prices of about 4,000 yuan (482 US
dollars). Those made in the Republic of Korea and the United
States are competing for market share.

</P>
<P>

Flight No. 140 from Medellin, capital of the Antioquia department,
to the Pacific resort of Bahia Solano, in Quibdo, Choco department.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections in Bosnia in May or June Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Local elections in Bosnia
will be held in May or June next year, Robert Frowick, head of the
mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) in Bosnia, said in Banja Luka Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Frowick, after a one-and-half-hour talk with Bosnian Serb
President Biljana Plavsic, told reporters that talks with plavsic
had been very constructive and that significant progress had been
achieved in bringing closer positions on the holding of local
elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections for local authorities were originally planned to
be held in September 14 together with the general elections for
central and canton power organs, but have been twice postponed by
the OSCE for fear of possible fraud.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug news agency report from Banja Luka, the
largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia, Plavsic told press after
the meeting that "the most important thing is that, in accordance
with modified electoral rules, all refugees regardless of their
current place of residence, will be able to vote."
</P>
<P>
A very important precondition for the holding of elections is
to prevent muslim intrusions into multi-ethnic separation zones,
the Serb president said, adding the Serb side will undertake all
necessary measures that such incidents are not repeated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Muslim refugees, while trying to return to
their homes in Serb-held areas in northeastern Bosnia, clashed
with local Serb civilians, leading to two Muslim dead and several
others wounded. The international community had to cancel plans
for the repatriation of refugees to their homes now controlled by
another ethnic group.

LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
considering to give British airlines access to the U.S. domestic
market by allowing them to conclude franchise agreements with
small American carriers.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the U.S. move could help break the
deadlock in negotiations over a new aviation agreement between
Britain and the United States, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will resume talks in London next week to try to
reach an open-skies agreement.
</P>
<P>
If the franchising proposal is accepted by the British side,
London and Washington will still have to solve the problem of U.S.
demands for greater access to London's Heathrow airport which
British government officials is full.

</P>
<P>
The candidates for the members of the council will be decided
by each nation itself and hopefully can be confirmed by the
country's parliament in early December, said Michael Steiner,

CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro left here this evening after a two-day visit to Egypt
during which he held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the Middle East peace process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Scalfaro discussed with Mubarak the bilateral
cooperation, especially in the economic field, and the situation
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro arrived in Egypt Friday and visited the cemetery of
the Italian forces in Alamein, a renowned World War Two
battleground.
</P>
<P>
He also met with speakers of the People's Assembly and the
Shura Council as well as other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro's two-day visit followed a series of high-powered Italian
missions to Egypt in the past couple of months by Italy's
ministers of defense and foreign affairs and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been Egypt's most important trade partner for
years. Its exports to Egypt stood at 1.96 billion U.S. dollars
last year, while imports stood at 1.79 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its contributions to the technical transfer, staff
training and research development programs with Egypt, Italy also
funded the Esna Dam, Egypt's second largest of its kind, through a
108-million-dollar soft loan.
