SPRINT MAY ONE DAY BE THANKFUL FOR COLLAPSE OF WORLDCOM MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star The Justice Department may have done
Sprint and WorldCom a favor by derailing their proposed merger.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt it's difficult for the heads of Sprint and WorldCom to
see a silver lining in the way things played out, but it may
transpire that there will be more opportunity in failure than
success.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible, of course, to know whether wonderful things
would have happened had the No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance carriers
been able to combine to challenge AT&AMP;T. The problem is, however,
that long-distance telephony as we know it is an industry whose
economics are undergoing drastic change.
</P>
<P>
   The changes hold much promise for consumers, but will make it
impossible for the enterprises involved to reap the lucrative
profits of the past.
</P>
<P>
   What it boils down to, many experts say, is the fact that the
cost of long-distance may someday fall to zero. For some ambitious
consumers, the price already has reached zero, because it's
included in the cost of their Internet connection or their cell
phone contract.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us who remain mired in a low-tech existence don't
appreciate such breakthroughs yet, but the pioneers have seen the
future and it is a wondrous world. To be sure, talking
long-distance by computer is still a clunky experience, but it's
merely a leading-edge example of what's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say the day is coming when the cost of using
long-distance won't be a per-call arrangement, but a matter of
buying access to the system in the same way Internet users
currently do.
</P>
<P>
   As the world of wireless telephony expands, connecting callers
across continents and oceans will be the same as connecting them
across town. As things stand, according to the experts, the cost of
a long-distance call is practically nothing compared with the cost
of system administration.
</P>
<P>
   Until this brave new world becomes a universal fact of life,
long-distance providers are depending on consumer inertia to keep
the lucrative per-call mind-set in place as long as possible. They
hope the transition will take at least as long as it did for
consumers to discover it was much more economical to own their
telephone instrument than lease it.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, it's impossible to fathom the rationality of the
Justice Department's effort to block the WorldCom-Sprint merger.
The trustbusters said AT&AMP;T's market share combined with
WorldCom-Sprint's would-be share left too much long-distance market
in too few hands.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but all that market share domination will vanish in the
future as the Bell regional companies get fully into long-distance,
as they inevitably will, and Internet carriers enhance and expand
their voice-exchange capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the relatively short period the WorldCom-Sprint
merger was on the table, the economics of the industry changed so
dramatically that the merged company would have had to reinvent
itself to meet future challenges.
</P>
<P>
   As a long-distance giant, the two may have been a good fit, but
traditional long-distance doesn't seem to be where it's at anymore.
Given Sprint's favorable technological position, perhaps a
different sort of partner will eventually generate an even better
deal for its shareholders.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Messier stood on the podium at Madison Square
Garden on Thursday morning during his reintroduction to New York
and the Rangers, but he could not speak.
</P>
<P>
   The tears flowing down Messier's face spoke for him instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I've embarrassed myself in front of millions of
people in America and Canada by crying,'' the always emotional
Messier finally blurted out, along with an attempt at a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no crying in other sports. But there is obviously
room for it in hockey, perhaps the toughest of them all. And on
Thursday, the tears shed by Messier were those of joy.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the shaven head, legendary stare and jutted jaw had
just donned his red-white-and-blue No. 11 sweater, with the
captain's ``C'' freshly stitched back on, for the first time in
more than three years. Not long before, Messier had signed a
two-year contract for a base total of $11 million to guarantee his
return.
</P>
<P>
   But there had to be tears of regret mixed in, too, for someone
who really needed no introduction to even the most casual of New
York sports fans. The Rangers have endured three seasons without a
playoff berth since Messier parted ways with the Rangers on July
28, 1997. Three long years of what-could-have-beens played out to
boos on Garden ice.
</P>
<P>
   At age 39 _ and after enduring three playoff-less seasons of his
own in Vancouver _ Messier now returns to the same Broadway stage
that he once owned like no other hockey player before or since.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is for a long-anticipated second act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to retire,'' Messier defiantly vowed, once all
his emotions had been contained. ``I'm here to win, to play well,
to do all the things I have done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier was brought back to New York for one purpose above all
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one conversation we had, Mark said to me he may not be able
to carry a team to the Stanley Cup, but he can certainly lead,''
said Glen Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manager.
``And leading is what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Messier's first acts as the Rangers' new captain was to
issue another of his guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee we're going to make the playoffs,'' he said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know where this franchise should be, where it's been
and where we're going to take it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier has made a career out of backing up his words. Game 6 of
the 1994 Eastern Conference finals immediately comes to mind, when
Messier not only promised a victory over the New Jersey Devils but
delivered it with a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Given how successful Messier's first act with the Rangers was,
someone questioned on Thursday the wisdom of his even attempting a
second one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a successful stint in New York for 54 years
before I got here,'' Messier shot back, referring to the Stanley
Cup he helped the Rangers win in 1994. ``Nobody knows what tomorrow
will bring. That's what we're here for.''
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier, Ron Low had been introduced as the Rangers' new
head coach. But this is clearly Messier's team. And town. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Garden president, indicated that he first
began to truly understand the significance Messier had in New York
on the day Wayne Gretzky retired, in April 1999. Almost two years
earlier, when Messier left for Vancouver, Checketts said something
in an interview that stung Rangers fans to their core.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long should we pay for that cup?'' Checketts said, words
he now regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all make mistakes,'' Checketts said on Thursday.
``But the past is the past and today is moving on. I've had very
few moments in 10 years at the Garden as special as what we just
experienced. I'm just glad he's back. It was probably a long time
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went so far as to import some genuine sod in a glass
tank, along with a pair of shovels, so that Messier and Checketts
could bury a hatchet, both literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Messier has become synonymous with New York like few
other modern-day athletes with any city,'' Checketts said before
the burying began. ``He has arguably meant more to the Rangers'
sweater than anyone who has ever worn it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns that Messier is past his prime. He had 17
goals and 37 assists in 66 games last season and will be 41 when
his contract is through. But Glen Sather, the Rangers' new
president and general manager who signed Messier to his first
National Hockey League contract in Edmonton, said he does not give
much credence to age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mark started playing in Edmonton, he was 18 years old and
everybody said he was too young,'' Sather said. ``Now, I've had a
lot of people tell me he's too old. How old was Gordie Howe when he
retired? 52. Some people can do it. Some people can't. I've seen
guys at 29 who were through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are gambling at least $11 million _ a $9 million
signing bonus plus a $1 million annual salary over the next two
years and assorted incentives _ that Messier is not.

NATIONAL FRED HARVEY MUSEUM WILL SHOWCASE A BIT OF U.S. AND KC
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Once upon a time, there
was a Kansas City company like none other.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It created the first national chain of hotels and restaurants.
It transformed the lives of thousands of young women. It
constructed buildings that became National Historic Landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The company changed _ perhaps forever _ the image of the
American Southwest. Its collection of Indian art and artifacts was
so renowned that William Randolph Hearst badgered the company to
sell him part of it to decorate his San Simeon castle in
California.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fairy tale. But much of the company's story has faded
from the scene _ even in Kansas City, where the company had its
headquarters in its glory years, from the late 1800s to 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Union Station, where the company's offices were, the
Fred Harvey Co. gets little attention, except as the name for a
food court and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But the historical vacuum is near an end. Later this year the
National Fred Harvey Museum is expected to open in Leavenworth,
Kan., in the house where the company's founder, Fred Harvey, lived
and died.
</P>
<P>
   The museum _ near Seventh and Olive streets _ has been in the
works for two years. Harvey artifacts valued at $500,000 have been
donated. An archive will be established to store family and company
papers. If all goes as hoped, the museum will open no later than
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our heart and soul is here, and this museum belongs to
Leavenworth _ and Kansas City,'' said J. Stewart Harvey Jr., a
great-grandson of Fred Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Harvey was an English immigrant who headed for Leavenworth,
where a job as a railway ticket agent awaited him. But he found his
future when he saw the need for better food for railroad
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his idea to the Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe Railway,
which let him operate restaurants along its routes.
</P>
<P>
   The first Harvey restaurant opened in Topeka in 1876. By 1916
the company's operations stretched west to Los Angeles and employed
2,100 people. The company slogan became ``3000 Miles of
Hospitality, From Cleveland to the Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   And all of it was overseen from the company's headquarters on
the second floor of Kansas City's Union Station. The town became
the home of most of the company's executives, who loved living in
what they considered the gateway to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the perfect place,'' said J. Stewart Harvey Jr., who
lived here as a boy. ``A better version of St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvey Co.'s attention to detail was legendary. Menus had
color prints of works by such artists as Thomas Hart Benton. Tables
were covered with linen tablecloths. Coffee was frequently checked
by a thermometer to ensure the correct temperature. Hamburger was
made from prime beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt it set the standard,'' said Rod Anderson,
owner of the Hereford House restaurant in Kansas City. He also
operates two restaurants in the renovated Union Station, including
the Harvey House Grill.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey expected no less from its customers. In 1921 it appealed
a case to the Oklahoma Supreme Court so Harvey restaurants would
not have to serve male diners who did not wear suits.
</P>
<P>
   Burnishing the story further were the Harvey Girls, the
restaurants' battalion of waitresses. The subject of a movie that
starred Judy Garland, Harvey Girls are seriously credited with
helping civilize the West by inhabiting rough-edged towns, where
they worked at Harvey restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs proved a lifeline to countless women. Through the
years, thousands of prospective Harvey Girls visited the company's
personnel office in Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1926, Kathryn Massey was an 18-year-old orphan
picking cotton on an Arkansas farm when she found out that the
Harvey Co. was hiring.
</P>
<P>
   She jumped at the chance of $50 a month plus room and board, and
was sent to a Harvey restaurant at La Junta, Colo., the first stop
on a long career that included working at Harvey restaurants at
Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the money, and I was grateful,'' she said. ``It
changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other details about the company are coming out that bring new
attention to its effect on popular culture, as well as its business
acumen. Even its practice of hiring mavericks is gaining admirers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Mary Jane Colter, who became the Harvey Co.'s
architect in the early 1900s, working out of a studio in Union
Station. She went on to design buildings such as the La Posada
hotel in Winslow, Ariz., and Hopi House in Grand Canyon National
Park, which have become National Historic Landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the geniuses of the Fred Harvey company is they were
comfortable in hiring individuals and not feeling threatened,''
said Karen Bartlett, producer of a film about Colter that the
Public Broadcasting Service broadcast last year.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City's Union Station opened in 1914, the Harvey Co.
decided to challenge the conventional wisdom that travelers didn't
have time to shop.
</P>
<P>
   It opened ``minute'' shops that sold products ranging from
cigars to toys to books. They thrived. /{Publisher's Weekly/} was
soon writing about Harvey's revolutionary ``take along a book''
idea. In 1937 it could report that the Union Station book shop was
the largest in town.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's real legacy, scholars say, is the way it
weaved its business interest with the culture of the Southwest and
created the region's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1905 it had a museum featuring Indian crafts and artifacts
adjoining the company's Alvarado Hotel in Albuquerque, N.M. It
began to offer tours that visited Indians where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   The company also formed an Indian Department that bought
American Indian-made items such as silver bracelets to be resold in
the company's gift shops. It kept a collection of Indian artifacts
that became highly sought by museums.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst had a 30-year business relationship with
the Harvey Co. Through the years he bought about 500 items and
often urged the company to sell him its best stuff. The company
sometimes refused even a Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buffalo hide shields, as I told you, we have always
refused to sell and would not sell one of them only to you,'' a
Harvey executive wrote in a letter to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1930s the company was noticing less interest in the
Indian items from tourists and collectors. An attempt at a
mail-order business selling the items flopped.
</P>
<P>
   There were deeper problems as well. The Santa Fe had begun to
serve meals on trains. Harvey had the dining car franchise, but
that meant many of its trackside restaurants had to close.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression had also weakened the company. Another blow
came with the death of the company's president, Frederick Harvey,
the founder's grandson. Another Harvey took over, but his offices
were in Chicago, where he ran the dining car operation. The
company's headquarters, and most of the Harvey family along with
it, moved to Chicago in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   After an upswing in business because of World War II, the
decline resumed as rail travel waned. The company tried to rally by
opening restaurants along the Illinois Tollway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never made a cent'' on the tollway restaurants, said J.
Stewart Harvey Jr., who was being groomed for a top job at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was told that the company's days were numbered and that
he would be better off pursuing a career elsewhere. In 1968 the
remnants were sold to another company, and the Harvey House
restaurant in Union Station was closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area lost its last connections to the Harvey
Co., though the Harvey name was resurrected when Union Station
reopened last year. J. Stewart Harvey Jr., who is now 68 and lives
in the Boston area, found another career. He is philosophical about
the company's demise, saying, ``Life moves on.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not too far. He recalls a visit to the Grand Canyon,
where two of the Harvey Co.'s premier hotels _ El Tovar and Bright
Angel Lodge _ still operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to go back to these places; it makes me
sad,'' he said. ``But now there's the museum in Leavenworth, and
that makes me feel good.''

POLL SHOW REPUBLICAN TALENT LEADING MISSOURI GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Republican Jim Talent
has taken a slight lead over Democrat Bob Holden in what has been a
largely invisible campaign for Missouri governor, a new survey
indicates.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The poll, commissioned by The Kansas City Star, gave Talent a 41
percent to 36 percent lead over Holden statewide. The 5-point
margin was up from a 2-point lead in a similar poll taken in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The lead, however, was within the poll's margin of error, which
was plus or minus 4 percentage points for each candidate's rating.
And 23 percent of the respondents were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant finding was the relatively low name
recognition of both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, the current state treasurer, ran successful statewide
campaigns for treasurer in 1992 and 1996. Yet more than one in four
of those surveyed said they did not recognize his name.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, of Chesterfield in St. Louis County, has represented
Missouri's 2nd Congressional District for the past eight years. But
nearly one of every five people surveyed said they did not
recognize his name.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Neuman, chairman of the political science department at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, said the poll's numbers reflect
how the race for governor has been overshadowed by the campaigns
for president and the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race matches two of Missouri's most successful
politicians. The Republican incumbent, Sen. John Ashcroft, has won
five statewide races and the Democratic challenger, Mel Carnahan,
has won four.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is kind of lost right now,'' Neuman said of the
Talent-Holden matchup. ``These other races are on, and people know
those people. This race is really the tail being wagged by the rest
of the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden, of Springfield, is the only candidate seeking the
Democratic nomination in the Aug. 8 primary. Talent faces only
token opposition from two challengers for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Neuman said Talent's lead over Holden could stem simply from his
greater name recognition in the St. Louis area, which accounted for
three of every eight people surveyed. As a statewide elected
official, Holden has no geographical base of support comparable to
Talent's.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Richard Martin, Holden's campaign
manager. Martin noted that Talent's 5-point lead was coupled with a
7-point advantage in name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues are not the reason (for Talent's lead),'' Martin said.
``It's people saying `We know him, so we're for him.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Scott, Talent's campaign manager, agreed that the campaign
has a long way to go. But he said the poll indicated that Talent's
message was finding a receptive audience, particularly in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Talent has tried to break through the noise of the
higher-profile campaigns, Scott said, by emphasizing grass-roots
organizing. He said Talent volunteers marched in 36 Fourth of July
parades, which he said far outpaced Holden's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research in
Washington, D.C., surveyed by phone 624 registered voters who said
they regularly vote in state elections. The calls were made from
July 6 to July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Phone numbers were chosen randomly within a cross-section of
telephone exchanges and weighted to reflect voter turnout in each
county. That means that 37 percent of the respondents were from the
St. Louis area. About 19 percent of those surveyed were from the
Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bradford Coker, Mason-Dixon's managing director, said the
poll shows that the race is wide open, because voters still don't
know the candidates. But the numbers indicate that Talent has been
more successful at getting his name known and at putting together a
campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Talent's 46 percent to 33 percent lead in the St.
Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Republican to take a double-digit lead in a
traditionally Democratic area is a sign that he is building some
support,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis area tally was notable because it came in the wake
of five weeks of television ads the Holden campaign ran there in
May and early June. Martin said the campaign had spent $350,000 to
introduce Holden to St. Louis voters. He said the poll was too late
to be affected by the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that while you are on the air, you have great
influence,'' Martin said. ``But when you're not on TV, you're off
the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Talent with slim leads in five of six regions of
the state. Holden's only advantage was the Kansas City area, where
he led 40 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Talent also held a decided edge among men, who favored him 44
percent to 33 percent. Among women, Holden led 39 percent to 38
percent. Both campaigns found something to crow about in the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Talent's showing in Kansas City was good considering
he had not spent much time here. Talent's 4-point lead in northern
Missouri and his 1-point advantage in the central part of the state
were astounding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boone County being the largest and most Democratic skews
everything in central Missouri. And for us to be up by 1 point
shows that rural Missouri is embracing our message,'' Scott said.
``I'm convinced it's because of our road plan. Jim Talent is the
only guy willing to fulfill the promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Talent has proposed a $10 billion bond program to build roads
promised in a 1992 plan that would have given a four-lane highway
to every town with a population of at least 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Martin predicted that the gender gap would close once the
campaign heats up and men begin to hear Holden's message. He said
he was encouraged by Holden's standing within 5 points of Talent in
heavily Republican southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he didn't put much credence in the poll results,
especially from rural counties. The Holden campaign's polling never
showed Talent leading anywhere but St. Louis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this poll shows is that it's going to be a bumpy
ride to the finish,'' Martin said. ``These snapshots of the
campaign can sometimes be a little out of focus.'' ( 30 )

WOODSIDE GETS FIRST LOOK AT STREET RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Sean Woodside of Saugus has spent most of his racing
career competing on tracks in and around Los Angeles, this weekend
will mark his first visit to the Ford L.A. Street Race.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual event on the streets of downtown Los Angeles
at Exposition Park is quickly becoming the most popular race on the
NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series, but it is an event that has
eluded Woodside, who is running his first full season on the
Southwest Series.
</P>
<P>
   The defending NASCAR Winston West champion visited the course
Tuesday for the first time in part to get a feel for the track and
in part to do an interview for Fox Sports. He described the course
as a Saugus Speedway version of a road course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like a lot of bumping and banging, this is the track to
go see,'' said Woodside, who won a NASCAR Sportsman points title
while at Saugus Speedway before it closed.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the course, Woodside, driver of the Southwest
Tenant Development Pontiac, said he needed some extra practice. So
on Wednesday, he went out to Willow Springs International Raceway
in Rosamond to practice driving go-karts on the desert road course.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Street Race is unique to NASCAR and to Southwest Series
drivers in a number of ways. It is the only NASCAR event of any
kind run on a temporary road course. And it is one of two events on
the Southwest Series that has pit stops. The L.A. Street Race is a
200-lap event. The only other race that has pit stops on the
Southwest Series is the Sears Point Raceway race in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long race for the team and the pits make it a little
bit tougher for some of the other teams,'' said Woodside, who is
fourth in points on the Southwest Series. ``But I'm used to the
longer races. And I'm used to doing pit stops. I just hope I don't
mess them up. It should be a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kanke ready, too: The last time MK Kanke of Frazier Park
competed in the L.A. Street Race, he led for 10 laps and might have
had a shot at winning if not for a broken motor he suffered after
the first pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   That was two years ago. And even though times have changed,
broken motors and damaged rear ends have plagued the Kennedy High
graduate over the last two Southwest Series races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having lots of breakage problems,'' said Kanke,
driver of the Player's Choice/Auto Warranty/4 Points Sheridan
Pontiac. ``But we got to look up for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent mechanical problems, Kanke's team has showed
promise. Kanke, who is fifth in the Southwest Series standings, won
the pole at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield two weeks ago for a
Southwest Series record-setting 23rd time. But a broken rear end
ended Kanke's day and he finished 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's looking for his luck to change at this weekend's L.A.
Street Race, an event on a course that appeals to Kanke's taste in
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done well there before and I enjoy it,'' Kanke said. ``It
makes more of the driver come out. I am looking forward to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanke said he is planning on driving the same car he used in the
Sears Point Raceway event in Sonoma last month. Sears Points is
also a road course, but differs from the L.A. event in that it is
not a temporary street course.
</P>
<P>
   The car Kanke used at Sears Point lost its motor during the
race, so his team has had to put together a new engine.
</P>
<P>
   __ NASCAR Winston West update Bill Sedgwick of Acton finished
fourth on July 4 in the NAPA Auto Parts 200, the final NASCAR
Winston West race ever run at Portland Speedway. Sedgwick, who won
the event last year, is seventh in the Winston West standings.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside finished fifth at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jefferson of Naches, Wash., won his first Winston West
event, while series leader Brendan Gaughan of Las Vegas was second.
Gaughan has a 125-point lead over second-place Kevin Richards in
the series standings.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Winston West schedule is the Coors Light
200 at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash., on Sunday. Richards is
the defending event champion. Woodside finished second and Sedgwick
fourth at the Evergreen event last year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Herta in for Mo at Toronto: Valencia's Bryan Herta will race
for Mo Nunn Racing at the CART FedEx Series Molson Indy in Toronto
on Sunday. Herta, who is subbing for Mo Nunn Racing's Tony Kanaan,
the team's regular driver, will be making his third start of the
season for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto's an absolutely terrific event,'' Herta said.
``Certainly, I think as far as the fans go there, they have some of
the most knowledgeable fans of Champ Car racing that we see all
year. And I really enjoy the street courses. I got to do Long Beach
this year (for Walker Racing) and that went pretty well (fifth
place). Hopefully we can recreate that at Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan, who injured his arm and ribs during qualifying for the
Grand Prix of Detroit, is expected back for the Michigan 500 on
July 23.

DROUGHT TALK DRIES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just weeks ago, amid
all that talk about drought, Gil Chappell saw an 80 percent chance
of trouble ahead for Kansas City area lawns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We had a dry fall and a dry winter,'' said Chappell, owner of
Lawn Pro of Kansas City, a Lenexa, Kan.-based company that has
serviced lawns for more than two decades. ``The early spring was
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came rain. Now the front yards of Lawn Pro customers in
Johnson and Jackson counties are doing pretty well. And Chappell
describes himself as ``sort of confounded.''
</P>
<P>
   All that talk about drought, you might say, has dried up _ at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the latest edition of the U.S. Drought Monitor, a
government-sponsored survey, showed significant improvements in
Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Dry areas from central Nebraska and north-central Kansas to the
east have received at least an inch of rain in the last week, and
the drought eased in most of the central United States, the survey
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1, Kansas City has received about 9.4 inches of rain,
nearly three inches more than normal, according to the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a remarkable turnaround,'' said Mark Svoboda, a
climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center in
Lincoln, Neb. ``In some areas, there's too much rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather patterns didn't happen as expected, he said. Moisture
flowed up from the Gulf of Mexico, and cold fronts from the
northwest came through and triggered storms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main explanation,'' Svoboda said, ``is that Mother Nature
is the one who calls the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can predict that drought problems are gone for 2000.
Chappell pointed out, for example, that area lawns are beginning to
develop signs of heat stress.
</P>
<P>
   Out in western Kansas, farms remain dry, as they do in the
Missouri Bootheel.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, everybody from corn farmers to government
officials were sounding more encouraged than discouraged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel much better,'' said Kyle Vickers, deputy director of
the Missouri Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Crops look good, as do farm ponds, he said. Although Milan, Mo.,
still has problems with the town water supply, most Missouri towns
aren't experiencing severe trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But soil moisture levels aren't where they should be, Vickers
said, and the drought should not be declared over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is what does the rest of the summer hold?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the Agriculture Department ponders the same question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the temperature stays hot and it doesn't rain, the crops
could easily deteriorate rather quickly,'' said Eldon Thiessen,
state statistician for the department. ``But we haven't gone down
that road yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some recent area rainstorms have been huge.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, Mo., 6 inches of rain hit the southern sections
of the city this week, and some residents had to use boats to leave
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In northeast Kansas, rains of as much as 5 inches near the
Delaware River eased a water shortage on the Kickapoo Indian
Reservation. Water conservation measures are no longer in place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kansas does have trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves has issued a drought watch for the Upper
Republican and Solomon river basins in northwest and north-central
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure residents are prepared to take appropriate
actions if conditions get worse,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Holton, Kan., a town about 30 miles north of Topeka, Kan., is
continuing to call for water conservation.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Brad Mears said lawn and garden watering has been
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been pretty good,'' he said. ``Our water demand
has dropped by 11 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the United States, conditions are far worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Drought Monitor said Thursday that in the southeastern
United States, a drought of historic proportions continues to
affect many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Streams are flowing at precipitously low levels, and crop
conditions declined markedly, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Pat Ross, who grows corn outside Lawrence, Kan., said
Thursday that it's best not to pay too much attention to forecasts.
The prognosticators, he said, have a hard enough time predicting
the weather for tomorrow and the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ross heard the drought talk in the spring and then saw plenty of
rain fall on his farm. He now has an above-average crop growing in
his fields. It may turn into a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are shaping up,'' said Ross, who raises field corn and
sweet corn. ``Our crops look pretty good for the time of the year
we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   But a farmer never wants to be without rain very long. Ross said
Thursday his crops need moisture again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready,'' he said. ( 30 )

COLLAPSE DOOMS BUILDING AND ITS TREASURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A wall and two floors collapsed on Thursday at an
architectural salvage shop in the East Village whose showrooms were
loaded with cast-iron fireplaces, Victorian bathtubs, original
porcelain New York street signs and Tiffany windows. The damage
left the building listing dangerously, forcing the evacuation of 51
apartments in three nearby buildings and leading the city to begin
an emergency demolition.
</P>
<P>
   The partial collapse shortly after 1 p.m. tore a three-story
hole in the south wall of the building at Second Avenue and Houston
Street in Manhattan. A construction crew was making alterations to
the first floor of the four-story shop, Irreplaceable Artifacts, in
defiance of an order to stop work, a spokesman for the city's
Buildings Department said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials ordered the building destroyed, along with
everything inside _ including several Tiffany windows valued at
$50,000 each and a walnut ceiling from William Randolph Hearst's
collection. Evan Blum, the owner of Irreplaceable Artifacts,
salvages fixtures from demolished buildings and refurbishes them.
The collection was worth millions of dollars, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse came two days after a building exploded in
Brooklyn, killing three people. The explosion, on Tuesday, believed
to have been caused by a natural gas leak, destroyed two town
houses in the Boerum Hill section.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's collapse, nine men and two women suffered minor
injuries, the police said. One man was taken to the hospital, where
he was expected to be treated and released. .
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters estimated that more than 100 people were shut out
of their apartments. Virginia Mewborn of the Red Cross, which will
feed and house the evacuated residents, said some were so
frightened that the agency had called in mental health counselors.
``What their idea of a building collapse is right now is what
happened in Brooklyn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blum had been planning to capitalize on the trendy night life on
the Lower East Side by opening a restaurant that would face his
courtyard on Houston Street. This spring, workers had begun to
punch arched doorways into the brick wall without a permit, said
Richard C. Visconti, the acting commissioner of the Buildings
Department.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, Visconti said, the department ordered a halt to
construction and issued a $2,500 fine, which he said had not been
paid. But this week, the department approved a proposal to alter
the building, Visconti said, though no permits had been issued. The
architect of record on the plans was the building's owner, Walter
Blum, who is Evan Blum's father, Visconti said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrzej Przytkla, a bricklayer who was working in the building,
said that before the collapse, he and other workers were replacing
bricks in a weak wall.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Blum said the workers were making minor repairs that did
not require a permit, and attributed the collapse to the building's
age. ``The building is 125 years old,'' he said. ``You get to 125,
how are you going to feel? You are going to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Blum is known as a pioneer in the field of
architectural salvage, and he has provided antique fixtures for
many movies and shows, including ``Sophie's Choice'' and ``Sex in
the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic,'' said Ralph Stevens, a cousin. ``Evan spends his
whole life saving items from buildings that were going to be
demolished.''

ANNOUNCEMENT OFFICIALLY ENDS SPRINT, WORLDCOM MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Complaining they got
a raw deal from regulators, Sprint Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
officially scuttled their long-troubled merger Thursday,
acknowledging that fighting the government in court would be
costly, protracted, distracting and hold an uncertain outcome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concession brought to a close one of the most controversial
and tumultuous chapters in Sprint's 100-year history, but left the
future of the Kansas City area's largest private employer as
uncertain as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey moved quickly to
reassure anxious employees that he hadn't abandoned one deal only
to become merger bait for a company such as Deutsche Telekom or
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint is not for sale,'' Esrey insisted at a press conference
at the company's new Overland Park &QL;  Kan., campus. The statement
drew rousing applause from several hundred employees who gathered
in an outdoor amphitheater at the campus to hear him pronounce the
unpopular deal dead.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said the WorldCom deal had been a unique opportunity to
fill gaps in the respective companies' services. He said management
is still obligated to consider better merger alternatives if they
come along, but he finds that unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see such a thing on the horizon,'' Esrey said. ``We
are not talking to anybody, haven't talked to anybody, and aren't
looking to talk to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the company would adopt a high-growth strategy
focused on wireless, data and Internet services, which he predicted
could generate annual revenue growth of 20 percent for the next
three years at least.
</P>
<P>
   The ``go it alone'' mantra is one that Esrey has been using for
the past five years, and repeated up to the day his company
announced its intention to merge with WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   And while the intention to resume that strategy may play well
with employees, analysts and industry observers remain skeptical
given the surfeit of companies who might take a run at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably putting on a new dress and getting ready to
go back to the ball,'' said Bob Rosenberg, an analyst with Insight
Research. ``Once you've been out there, it's hard to go back
another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers think Sprint is still a strong independent
competitor. Indeed, many customers prefer it stay that way, as the
company has a solid reputation for technical innovation, customer
service and aggressive pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the absence of the Sprint//WorldCom merger, there
is still no single telephone company that can provide a complete
portfolio of voice and data services wherever customers need them.
So Sprint is not at an immediate disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to employees Thursday, however, Esrey said it was
clear that with the rapid pace of change and consolidation, ``we
can't be all things to all people. We will need to be energized in
the areas where we have a competitive advantage and where we can
define the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey wouldn't specify areas that the company intends to
de-emphasize, but he did make it clear that pricing and profit
margins are under pressure in the company's flagship long-distance
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the consumer long-distance business is dead,'' he
said, encapsulating the argument that WorldCom and Sprint tried
unsuccessfully to make with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In Esrey's view, the company's future lies in providing packages
of communications services that bundle local, long-distance,
wireless, data and high-speed Internet services to high-value
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has many of the components it needs for that bundle, but
still has the same weaknesses and resource problems that led it to
consider a merger with WorldCom in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable is the company's lack of international assets, a
hole that would have been filled nicely by WorldCom, and still
could be by a large international carrier like Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Providing high-end voice and data services to lucrative
multinational customers is one of the sweet spots in the
telecommunications industry, but one key is the ability to provide
end-to-end service across geographic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint sold its European networks when it entered its Global One
international venture with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.
Since that troubled partnership was dissolved, however, Sprint has
been quietly expanding its Internet backbone in Western Europe,
Esrey said in an interview on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Sprint lacks local connections in markets around
the country to reach business and consumers without relying on the
regional Bell operating companies like Southwestern Bell, which
control the local loop.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that was one advantage of a merger with WorldCom, which
owns fiber networks in 100 of the largest metropolitan areas
nationwide. It's also the reason that some observers see merger
possibilities with BellSouth, whose local territory covers the
entire Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said the company plans to lease fiber rings in major
metropolitan areas around the country, and would install its own
equipment in Bell company offices that could reach 30 million
consumers by the end of the year, half of them with its high-speed
Sprint ION service.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's local strategy, Esrey said, relies heavily on ION, a
bundled service that combines high-speed data with local and
long-distance service. ION has been introduced for consumers in 10
cities, but has been plagued by delays, technical problems and
limited geographic availability.
</P>
<P>
   The holes in Sprint's services aren't necessarily fatal,
analysts say. The company doesn't have to build and own all the
facilities it uses to provide service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take technology and the backbone they have and use lots of
other carriers to fill the gaps,'' said Jeanne Schaaf, an analyst
with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``Sprint's brand and
Sprint's Web site will still be out in front of the customers, but
all the facilities don't have to be Sprint's.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger hurdle Esrey may face is the lingering expectation
that he will sell the company to bring a quick return to
shareholders, including himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as everyone expects you to be acquired, it's hard to
operate for the long term,'' said Steve Koppman at Dataquest Corp.,
a market research firm. ``Employees leave. Others make plans to
retire. Customers are reluctant to sign new contracts if they're
worried the company will be acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has already faced some turnover in its top management
ranks, and could face additional departures if Esrey and his top
lieutenant, Ronald T. LeMay, fail to overcome employee skepticism
regarding the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only issue is whether Esrey and LeMay have what it takes
to bring some enthusiasm back to the employees and get this thing
going forward,'' Schaaf said.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he was disappointed in recent management departures,
and would be worried if the company ``lost a whole slew of
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the management team we have in place is as strong as
ever,'' he said. ``We're not hurting, wounded or nicked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Esrey and LeMay will begin traveling
around the Sprint system to meet with employees and start an
initiative called ``Mapping the Future.''
</P>

</P>
<P>

campus Thursday was still circumspect.
</P>

   ``We'll just see who comes along next,'' he said.

A LETTER FROM WILLIAM T. ESREY TO SPRINT EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By   
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Dear Associates:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today we announced the termination of our proposed merger with
WorldCom, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   As I reflect on the past nine months, it is clear that a merged
Sprint and WorldCom was an exceptional opportunity to create a
broad-based international competitor. But no matter how much we may
disagree with the regulators or believe that we could eventually
prevail in court, it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Litigating these matters in court against the Justice Department
would be costly, protracted and distracting. And, even if we
prevail in court, the merger would still be contingent on getting
approvals from the FCC and the European Commission. Given the
time-consuming nature of the litigation, the extended regulatory
processes and the veil of continued uncertainty, pursuing that
option would not be in the best interests of our shareholders,
customers or any of you.
</P>
<P>
   I am confident in our decision. It is the right one because of
what our employees can accomplish going forward. No matter the
distractions, no matter what competitors threw at you or what
technological changes occurred, you have never lost sight of what
it takes to be successful. You are the Sprint brand. Through your
efforts we have delivered record results for 12 consecutive
quarters, and I firmly believe we will continue that success well
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   When we decided to pursue the merger, it was not because the
management team or the board of directors wanted to sell Sprint or
thought we were too small to compete. To say we are too small is
fundamentally wrong. We have successfully competed against much
larger companies and have been successful in growing faster than
the market. Rather, we chose to pursue the WorldCom merger because
it gave us an opportunity to do things we probably couldn't do as a
stand-alone company. It would have given us immediate scope and
geographic placement of facilities to be a more general competitor.
</P>
<P>
   However, we have an excellent array of assets, products and
services in the fastest-growing areas of telecommunications:
wireless personal communications services, the Internet, high-speed
data services, wireline and wireless broadband services, along with
packages and bundles of communications services aimed at high-end
consumers and small business.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weeks and months ahead, we will be mapping out
strategies that build upon our current success. It is clear,
however, given the rapid pace of change and consolidation that we
can't be all things to all people. We will need to be energized in
the areas where we have a competitive advantage and where we can
define the future.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, success lies with our ability to offer bundled
communications packages. It lies with placing more emphasis than
ever in implementing a ``One Sprint'' attitude in every employee.
It means a fast-moving, risk-taking environment that rewards action
and creativity. It means putting our capital resources in the areas
growing the fastest and building those initiatives and businesses
at even faster rates so that they form the basis of a very
high-growth strategy. We have a remarkable engine in place.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS is again expected to lead the industry in subscriber
growth in the second quarter, with growth being driven by extensive
consumer distribution channels (presence in more than 12,000 retail
outlets nationwide) and expanding penetration of the corporate
market.
</P>
<P>
   Data services in both the wireline and wireless businesses are
vibrant. Sprint PCS has several hundred thousand customers using
PCS wireless Web services, and new content providers are being
added almost daily. High-end data services in the company's long
distance operation grew 50 percent year over year in the first
quarter and have annualized revenues in excess of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of broadband services, Sprint ION is now available
to large businesses nationwide and to small businesses and
consumers in 10 major markets. High-speed Internet access over
fixed-wireless (MMDS) is off to a highly promising start in Phoenix
and Tucson, and we continue to rapidly deploy DSL service in
Sprint's local territories.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a separate business unit focused on Internet
services is already establishing momentum, growing at over 75
percent or roughly double the market rate of growth. Web hosting
centers have been added to the Sprint backbone network and we have
expanded into western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Our local division had its best quarter in its 100-year history.
We are holding our own in an increasingly competitive traditional
voice long distance market, where we continue to experience
double-digit volume growth.
</P>
<P>
   It is vitally important that you stay informed. During the
merger process we were committed to communicating with you frankly
and frequently. We will not sway from that commitment as we move
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Pinpoint we have replaced the merger site with a new site:
Sprint Strategic News _ Mapping The Future. Ron LeMay and I will be
traveling around the Sprint system meeting with as many of you as
possible to talk about the future, and we look forward to hearing
from you.
</P>
<P>
   My life, my future is here. Ron LeMay has assured me that the
same is true for him. We are both more enthused than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint brand has always stood for technological innovation,
excellent customer service and creative marketing. This is our
foundation. It is our strength. And with your commitment, together
we will continue to make Sprint the standard by which others are
measured and the most-admired company in our industry.
Sincerely, Bill Esrey Chairman and CEO

<P>
   THE CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   GOP HONORS HOFFA
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to hold a reception honoring the Teamsters
president, James P. Hoffa, on July 31, the first night of their
party's convention in Philadelphia. The announcement Thursday by
Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
underlined the Republicans' desire to win Teamsters support, or at
least persuade the 1.4-million-member union not to endorse Vice
President Al Gore, who has worked hard behind the scenes to win the
union's backing. Thus far, Hoffa has bucked the AFL-CIO and not
endorsed Gore because the vice president supported the China trade
bill. In recent weeks, Hoffa has had kind words for Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate. Nicholson said this would be the first
time in at least 20 years that the Republicans have held a
reception for a union president at their convention.
</P>
<P>
   NBC RELYING ON CABLE
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the migration of political news to cable, NBC News
announced Thursday that its coverage of the party conventions on
one of its cable outlets, MSNBC, would form ``the centerpiece of
the NBC News effort.'' NBC will carry prime time reports from the
Republican and Democratic conventions for a total of only two and a
half hours on the final two nights of the four-day events, with the
Republicans in Philadelphia and the Democrats in Los Angeles. That
is less than the four hours over three nights that ABC News has
announced. But NBC News officials said the division's anchors and
correspondents will appear throughout the continuing coverage of
all four days of the gatherings on MSNBC. A total of 13
convention-related programs will be broadcast from the convention
cities by the network. The broadcast networks, which are much more
heavily watched than the cable channels, have been criticized by
media watchdog groups for cutting back their coverage this year.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS SETTLE LABOR DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   The last union without a contract for work at next month's
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles has resolved a labor
dispute, allaying fears that labor troubles might disrupt the
gathering. Local 501 of the International Union of Operating
Engineers accepted a contract offer on Tuesday to manage the
heating, cooling and electrical systems in the convention venue.
Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, site of this summer's Republican
National Convention, Local 58 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers is questioning why some television networks are
not using union laborers for telecommunications work in that city's
convention hall. Mayor John Street is trying to resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   THE REFORM PARTY
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN CONSIDERS A LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   In the Reform Party's latest show of disarray, Pat Buchanan, who
is seeking its presidential nomination, has threatened to sue the
party if the names of 400,000 people who requested party primary
ballots through his campaign are made available to his rival, John
Hagelin. By a 7-2 vote on Wednesday night, the party's executive
committee voted to uphold rules that provide all candidates with
equal access to potential primary voters. The actual names are not
given to any campaign. But Buchanan has refused, and a spokesman
said his campaign would not discuss the matter. Not so for Hagelin,
who called Buchanan's position ``the latest assault on the
democratic process of the Reform Party.'' The Hagelin campaign has
agreed to make its list of 24,000 names available to Buchanan for
the distribution of campaign material. Michael Farris, chairman of
the presidential nomination committee, said he was trying to reach
an agreement with the Buchanan campaign to avoid a lawsuit.

ANALYSTS OFFER PREDICTION ON SPRINT STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The stock market was
initially unimpressed by the go-it-alone strategy broadcast by
Sprint Corp. Chairman William T. Esrey on Thursday after the merger
with WorldCom Inc. was officially called off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint's FON stock closed at $48, up $1, on the New York Stock
Exchange. That price is a far cry from the $76 a share offered by
WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Sprint shareholders may yet see the
stock hit $70 and up, but probably not soon. At least one believes
Sprint stock will languish unless it is prepared for a radical
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Sprint's PCS digital wireless business rose 61 cents
to $61.81 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if another of the myriad of potential buyers makes a run at
Sprint, they probably couldn't find the level of cost savings that
Sprint and WorldCom could, some analysts said. As a result, they
would probably bid far less than WorldCom's $129 billion offer.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said Thursday he knew shareholders were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had negotiated a very favorable deal for ourselves, and we
didn't get it done,'' Esrey said. ``It wasn't fair and they are
disappointed, I am sure. It was a lost opportunity, but I don't
think we are any worse off for having done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sting of disappointment won't wear away soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say patience is the most important element at this
time,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a research
firm for institutional investors. ``We think Sprint has a lot of
value. We also don't see the stock moving for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett conceded another buyer could emerge for Sprint. It does
have ``trophy properties,'' he said. Deutsche Telekom of Germany
and Atlanta-based BellSouth have been mentioned as possible buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who the big players are, but they probably won't rush
out and make an offer,'' Burnett said. ``They will let the stock
trade down and quietly fade. We have no problem seeing a value
ultimately of $70, but when? We are of the view that it will trade
in the $40 to $42 range on the low end and $50 at the high end for
a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klugman, of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, agrees that
unless another buyer comes in _ and another might _ the stock will
remain depressed for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has a lot going for it, but a lot of the performance of
Sprint right now will depend on when and if they find another
buyer,'' Klugman said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprint remains independent, Klugman said the Westwood company
has operating holes to fill that will cost it money to buy or
build. ``It doesn't have much local, and it doesn't have anything
internationally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint had an international alliance with Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom that gave it access to European infrastructure. But
that partnership dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Local networks may be an even greater concern, Klugman said,
because Sprint can't get all of its other services to customers
cost effectively if it has to continue to go through someone else's
local lines.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC World Markets has downgraded Sprint's stock to a ``hold,''
but not because the WorldCom deal failed. CIBC no longer believes
the business model of being a vertically integrated
telecommunications company is valid.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC analyst Steve Kamman said his firm thinks
telecommunications is at the same place that personal computers
were in 1987 when the cost of providing more and more computer
power dropped dramatically. In telecommunications, the cost of
providing fiber optics and broadband services is beginning to fall
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC sees companies dividing into wholesalers of
telecommunications and Internet services, and retailers with strong
marketing and customer attention. Kamman sees Sprint falling in the
second category.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, companies like Level 3 Communications and
Williams Communications have emerged as aggressive wholesalers of
services such as fiberoptic networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can maximize the value of your customers or you can
maximize the value of your assets, but you are going to have to
focus on one or the other,'' Kamman said.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom wanted Sprint primarily because of Sprint's PCS
wireless service. WorldCom has no wireless operations, considered
essential to have a complete consumer telecommunications division.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that if WorldCom didn't get
Sprint's wireless operations, WorldCom might get out of consumer
services entirely and concentrate just on business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed in a year,'' Kamman said, ``and dusting off
last year's strategic plan is probably not going to get it.''

NEW YORK HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN UNDER SCRUTINY FOR FREE-WHEELING
DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Fla., N.J.) 
By CHRISTOPHER DREW and MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Anthony Watson took command of the Health
Insurance Plan of Greater New York nearly a decade ago, he vowed to
turn the city's oldest and least expensive health maintenance
organization into a first-class operation.
</P>
<P>
   He had bold plans to keep caring for the nonprofit's traditional
New York clientele _ city workers and the poor _ while attracting
millions of wealthier corporate employees up and down the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, many of his ambitions have failed, burying HIP
in a deep financial hole. Expanding into other states has led to
big losses. And regulators in New York are investigating whether
Watson spent too freely in other ways, squandering millions of
dollars on lavish salaries, executive perquisites and contracts for
board members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state Insurance Department and the attorney general's
office are examining HIP's finances, looking into what former
executives describe as a clubby atmosphere that often seemed at
odds with HIP's special role in the city's health care system.
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia created the plan in the 1940s to provide
affordable coverage for city workers, and it insures many Medicare
and Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, insurance regulators have
dispatched auditors to pore over HIP's books. They have also
subpoenaed documents and taken depositions from Watson and two
other executives.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Levin, the superintendent of insurance, said the scope of
the inquiry was broad.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions focus on Watson, 59, whose taste for fancy
cars and corporate apartments seems to have infuriated regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HIP's financial reserves have dwindled below the
amount required by law.
</P>
<P>
   While Watson says he did nothing improper, the investigators are
exploring whether some of the expenditures were inappropriate for a
nonprofit corporation like HIP, which is exempt from most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say HIP's troubles also reflect other problems. They
say Watson's expansions beyond HIP's New York customer base were
too risky in competitive health industry. And recent changes to
broaden the stable of doctors, stemming in part from a feud between
Watson and a New York medical group, have troubled health
regulators trying to minimize disruptions in care.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and analysts said they do not expect HIP to collapse.
But they said it is also clear that the city's taxpayers will have
to underwrite part of the cost of reviving the plan.
</P>
<P>
   HIP's biggest losses have come outside New york. It lost $40
million when its operation in New Jersey collapsed last year. Its
operations in Florida have cost $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   But given its appeal to workers in the New York's clerical,
sanitation and teachers unions, the easiest place for HIP to raise
money is in New York, where it counts 200,000 city workers and
their relatives among its 796,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, HIP raised its premiums by 9.9 percent, which will
add about $100 million to the city's health care costs. HIP
officials say they plan increases of 8 percent to 12 percent in
each of the next three years. Such increases are not inconsistent
with what other HMOs have been seeking, and HIP remains a popular
option because other plans charge premiums that are 10 percent to
20 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, a tall, gruff man known for his intimidating style,
conceded in an interview that he had made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his $1 million annual pay package, he agreed that the
most visible symbols of extravagance were two Jaguars that HIP
leased for him _ one each in New York and Florida. HIP and its
Florida subsidiary also rented several apartments for executives,
including one for Watson near Miami that cost $7,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   HIP got rid of the cars and apartments last year after The Daily
News wrote about some of HIP's expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some critics caution that at HIP, there are echoes of the
kind of financial dangers that almost ruined Empire Blue Cross and
Blue Shield, another health provider, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   HIP fell below the state requirement for financial reserves four
years ago. It is now $71 million below the $153 million required as
a cushion against unexpected claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really short,'' said Martin Weiss, chairman of Weiss
Ratings, which analyzes the strength of HMOs. ``They are not broke,
but they are heading that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson and other HIP executives dispute that, saying they
believe the worst days are past. They note that while HIP's
customer base fell to 727,000 members in 1998 from 906,000 members
in 1990, the company began to rebound in 1999, reflecting some
success in attracting new corporate clients. And last year, the New
York operation made its largest profit ever _ $25 million, though
most of it was sent to cover losses in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a much better company than we were,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaint files at the state Department of Health suggest that
HIP's care has improved in some areas, but that its quality of care
has remained about the same over all, as at other large HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   HIP TAKES ON HEAVYWEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   When Watson became HIP's chief executive in 1990, the giant
profit-making HMOs like Oxford Health Plans and U.S. Healthcare
were growing rapidly, and HIP's niche in New York no longer looked
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Watson's response _ competing with the
heavyweight HMOs _ started HIP on the free-spending ways that have
endangered it.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he had little choice. At the time, HIP had a
``terrible reputation.'' he said, ``It was accused of being a place
with foreign doctors, dirty clinics, and just not a place you
wanted to get medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who had worked in public health for 20 years, spent
millions of dollars to renovate HIP's medical centers. Members had
to go to these clinics for treatment, an approach that set HIP
apart from other HMOs with a greater choice of doctors. Watson also
decided to expand operations in New Jersey and Florida. HIP had
moved into Florida in the late 1980s to serve New York members who
retired there, and Watson wanted to compete for more business
there.
</P>
<P>
   To improve HIP's image, he moved headquarters from a building
with wire-caged windows to elegant offices on West 34th Street. He
also raised salaries to levels that were competitive with large,
for-profit companies. Before long, office meetings were accompanied
by catered meals, former executives say. Watson held management
retreats at the Montauk Yacht Club on Long Island and rewarded
sales representatives with trips to resorts.
</P>
<P>
   But his ambitions foundered in the mid-1990s. First, the
Giuliani administration, facing budget problems, forced HIP to
accept a three-year freeze in premiums. So in 1996, HIP tapped its
financial reserves to upgrade an antiquated computer system that
was letting claims go unpaid. With membership falling, it also
began making plans to create its own broad network of doctors to
appeal to more customers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, business analysts said, was that managed
care companies were undercutting one another on premiums, and HIP
was ill-equipped to compete. Expenses spiraled up, and as a
nonprofit corporation, HIP could not raise capital as easily as its
profit-making competitors to off-set losses.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators closed HIP's operations in New Jersey last year after
a troubled partner, PHP Healthcare Corp. of Reston, Va., raked off
most of HIP's cash.
</P>
<P>
   Now HIP's Florida affiliate is costing even more. Last year, HIP
sent $18 million _ all raised from premiums paid by New Yorkers _
to Florida. That brought the total of HIP's subsidies there to $80
million, more than enough to cover the current deficit in its
reserve in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Records show that HIP has spent tens of millions of dollars in
Florida on marketing, including expensive sky box rentals at
professional sports events. Yet it still has fewer than half the
members of any one of the three largest HMOs there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal prosecutors have been investigating whether
a Florida union leader did anything improper to help outside sales
brokers hired by HIP. The brokers helped HIP win a contract with
the Broward County School District, but Watson said he did not
believe anything improper occurred.
</P>
<P>
   PAYING FOR EXECUTIVE PERKS
</P>
<P>
   As Watson's ambitions for HIP rose, so did his insistence on
enjoying the rewards of running a larger company, former executives
say.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's salary and bonuses soared to $995,000 last year from
$395,000 in 1993. Contractually, he is entitled to a company car.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance regulators are reportedly looking at whether HIP
violated any laws that forbid nonprofit corporations to enrich
their officers or to spend in ways that do not further their public
mission.
</P>
<P>
   One set of questions involves the corporate apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Watson acknowledged that he personally selected the
$7,000-a-month waterfront apartment in Miami. Watson said he used
it once a month when he went to Florida on business.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Maiorana, the plan's spokesman, said HIP also had rented
two apartments in Manhattan in the late 1990s to save on hotel
bills for visiting executives. He said the most expensive one, on
East 65th Street, cost $4,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are also scrutinizing some of HIP's contracts
with suppliers. In particular, they are looking at millions of
dollars in building leases and office-cleaning contracts to
determine whether HIP paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that shortly before Watson was promoted to HIP's
top job in late 1990, HIP agreed to a new lease on a clinic that
real estate experts describe as unusually favorable to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are looking into whether those charges were
excessive _ and drained money from medical care. Documents show
that in 1998, the doctors solicited a proposal from another
cleaning contractor offering cheaper rates.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUESTION OF OVERSIGHT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To consumer advocates, one question is: Why didn't HIP's board
members _ or political leaders _ better monitor Watson?
</P>
<P>
   As a nonprofit organization, HIP depends on civic, union and
business leaders to oversee its executives. Critics say that at
HIP, one answer may be that influential board members had business
ties or other possible conflicts that compromised their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   When an investment adviser, Charles Johnston, left HIP's New
York board in 1994, shifting over to its boards in New Jersey and
Florida, Watson gave him a $250,000 contract to watch the New York
plan's investments.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1993, when the Rev. Carl Flemister, a Baptist minister,
suggested sending volunteers to comfort hospitalized HIP members,
Watson gave him a $125,000-a-year contract to start the program.
Flemister is now the chairman of an umbrella board that oversees
all of HIP's operations. He still runs the volunteer program and
was paid $183,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Elson, a professor at Stetson University College of Law
in St. Petersburg, Fla., and an expert in corporate governance,
said such arrangements could cause board members to consider their
own interests over the company's.
</P>
<P>
   Flemister, Johnston and Watson all denied that the deals had
clouded their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a fair question to anyone who doesn't know me,''
Flemister said. ``But I would not destroy my reputation of 50
years, having people gossip that Tony controls me. ''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators are also looking at whether HIP officials have
done anything improper in encouraging doctors to make political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   As a nonprofit organization, HIP cannot make campaign
contributions. So the medical groups that operate its clinics
created a political action committee in 1992. Records show that the
committee has donated $160,000 to more than four dozen political
groups and officials, including Gov. George E. Pataki and his
predecessor, Gov. Mario Cuomo, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and
former Mayor David N. Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, there are questions about whether Watson or his
aides have gone too far. Documents show that in June 1999, for
instance, Watson's chief of staff, Raymond Vacca, faxed the
committee a list of seven recommended donations totaling $8,750.
</P>
<P>
   HIP BANKING ON NEW MEMBERS
</P>
<P>
   New York regulators could force major changes in how HIP
operates. New Jersey is demanding $83 million to cover medical
bills left unpaid there. And while Watson thinks he can stop the
losses in Florida, he said he also could sell or close the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watson expressed confidence that HIP's fortunes had
turned. He estimated that with the recent rate increase, the plan
would earn a $40 million profit in New York this year.
</P>
<P>
   And under state law HIP, can keep raising rates without
regulatory approval. This means that HIP could resuscitate its
finances through a series of rate increases, unless New York city
officials object. The city pays the premium for workers who choose
HIP, and it contributes the same amount for workers who select a
more expensive plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, HIP is also banking heavily on attracting more
members by expanding its network of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, state health regulators delayed HIP's plan to
transfer the patients cared for by the New York Medical Group to
organizations run by four hospitals. State health officials said
they were worried that care for some patients, especially pregnant
women and those with cancer, could be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, regulators have agreed to changes only in the Bronx
and in Westchester County, where Montefiore Medical Center began
caring for patients on July 1. Contracts with hospitals in
Manhattan are either still being completed or are awaiting state
approval. And while HIP expects most of the same doctors to remain
at its clinics, many are now working under temporary arrangements,
and some have quit.

COMPANY NEEDS TO CONTINUE COMMUNICATION WITH EMPLOYEES, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the wake of a
failed megamerger, Sprint Corp. Chairman William T. Esrey and his
lieutenants face a monumental task in getting their 78,000
worldwide employees refocused, recommitted and re-energized,
consultants said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A corporate change consultant believes Esrey got off to a good
start with a long letter to employees, which was circulated
Thursday morning, hours before Esrey officially announced that the
$129 billion deal was definitely off.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed all the important issues in his letter _ why the
merger was agreed to in the first place, why it was being called
off, why he thinks Sprint can go it alone, and why Sprint has been
and will be successful. He also emphasized the role of employees in
building the Kansas City area's largest company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give the letter an A _ he hit all the hot points,'' said
Don Blohowiak, a corporate change consultant based in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference Thursday morning, employees responded with
prolonged applause when Esrey said Sprint is not for sale. Yet for
the rest of the conference, many employees listened with crossed
arms and grim faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because there's still this realization that this really
isn't over,'' Blohowiak said. ``On an intuitive level, they all
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Blohowiak expects recruiting vultures to circle
Sprint now more than ever, as wearied and drained employees who've
lived through nine months of angst, anxiety and uncertainty have to
decide if they would want to subject themselves to a repeat
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint employees are between a hard spot and their hearts,''
said Mary Lippitt, who specializes in organizational improvement
and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the possibility of brain drain, Sprint officials
need to give employees a compelling reason to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what employees need now is candor and a focus on
Sprint's mission,'' said Connie Russell, a career development coach
who has several Sprint employees as clients. ``They need to restate
their core business and why each and every employee is valuable to
the future of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the letter to employees Thursday and in all
subsequent communications from the executive suite, employees will
be looking for the tea leaves that will reveal their future.
</P>
<P>
   And during the coming months there will be a lot of stress on
middle management in particular, who will be trying to interpret
signals from senior management to reassure those on the front
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Pennington, a business consultant who co-wrote On My
Honor, I Will, said it's his impression that Esrey and his team
have been forthright.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Blohowiak said it's his guess that everyone at Sprint _
from Esrey all the way down _ is shell-shocked by the bouncing ball
of it's on, it's off, it's dying, it's dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very tiring,'' Blohowiak said. ``There are a bunch of
very fatigued people at Sprint who should probably take a
vacation.''

FOR BUSH, TEXAS DEFICIT BECOMES ISSUE IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the past few years, Texas has enjoyed such a
booming economy that any news about the state budget has usually
been good. So when state lawmakers this week announced a $610
million shortfall, the bad news came as a surprise and prompted a
pregnant political question:
</P>
<P>
   How much of the blame belongs to Gov. George W. Bush? Needless
to say, Bush and his presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore,
offered very different answers on Thursday as they campaigned
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, where he appeared with former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, Gore blamed the Texas governor for putting
``politically popular'' tax cuts ahead of paying for Medicaid and
other state services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Gore said, ``Governor Bush wants to do for American
what he's done for Texas: go to Washington and spend our surplus
and then more for budget-busting tax cuts _ and hope that somehow
it will all add up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, with Gov. Tom Ridge at his side, Bush shot
back, pointing out that earlier state budget surpluses had made tax
cuts the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore suggests a state with a surplus shouldn't cut
taxes,'' he asked, ``then how can the American people count on Al
Gore to cut taxes when our nation has a surplus?''
</P>
<P>
   There also was no agreement in Texas as to where any blame
should lie. Several Democratic lawmakers traced the shortfall to
the $1.6 billion in tax cuts pushed by Bush and his allies. But the
governor's supporters countered that such claims were cheap
politics, noting that many Democrats had voted for the budget
package.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question in Texas is, what, if anything, the
deficit means for the state's fiscal future. In a bad economic
year, the news might have meant immediate budget cuts. But the
strong economy is expected to generate $1 billion in surplus tax
revenues, and key lawmakers said the money would more than cover
the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were predictions of future belt-tightening. On
Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, agreed that the state
did not face any budget cuts, but he said expanding services as
part of the next budget package now seemed less likely.
</P>
<P>
   The basic explanation for the shortfall can be found in Texas'
two-year budget cycle. Lawmakers drafted the current budget, which
runs through Aug. 31, 2001, during last year's legislative session.
The $99 billion budget, which is divided about evenly between
federal matching funds and state general revenues, included a
$3,000 pay raise for teachers and $1.7 billion in tax cuts _ the
latter pushed aggressively by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Rob Junell, the influential Democratic chairman
of the House Appropriations Committee, said the shortfall occurred
because lawmakers had underestimated the cost of some services when
they drafted the current budget. In particular, he said, the rising
cost of prescription drugs had created Medicaid overruns of $439
million, while a shortage of prison space meant the state had to
spend $168 million to pay for local jail space. The remaining
overruns were divided between different state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can in forecasting these numbers, but
you're going to be wrong,'' said Junell, a legislative ally of the
governor's.
</P>
<P>
   He said such mid-cycle shortfalls requiring supplemental
appropriations were common in Texas. ``Had we not had a governor
running for president of the United States, there would be no
story, because we do this all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, noted that shortfalls
also occurred in midstream during other budgets _ $182 million in
1997 and $104 million in 1999. In Pennsylvania, Bush said that
President Clinton was planning to sign on Thursday a $15 billion
supplemental appropriation for extra expenses in the current
federal budget year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today my opponent attacked me because we're going to do
the same thing in Texas,'' he said. He added: ``That's why Vice
President Al Gore has got no credibility on an issue like this. On
one hand he wants to launch an attack. On the other hand President
Clinton is doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic Texas lawmakers were critical of Bush and the
emphasis he has placed on tax cuts. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat from
Texas, flew to Wisconsin to appear with Gore and brief reporters
about the budget shortfall. He said the size of this year's
shortfall was particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A supplemental appropriation is standard,'' said Coleman. ``A
supplemental appropriation between $610 million and $750 million is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats say they worry that the deficit may reach $750
million. Coleman was particularly critical of the Medicaid
overruns, saying that Bush and lawmakers had known that fewer
federal dollars would be available for the program. He said
lawmakers intentionally underfunded Medicaid to free up money for
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that by spending this year's $1 billion surplus to
cover the shortfall, future budgets are short-changed. ``Once
you've spent that $1 billion, you've got to keep spending it
forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Gallego, a Democrat state representative expressed concern
that the state might return to the problems of the early 1990's,
when tough economic times prevented any expansion of services. But
he, like other Democrats, did vote in favor of the budget package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unfair to Monday morning quarterback, to say what
you did didn't work,'' he said. ``We had an opportunity to vote yay
or nay, and most of us voted yay. We're in the same boat as
Governor Bush on this issue.''

MEXICAN LAWMAKERS RELEASE DETAILS OF SUSPECT LOANS DURING BANK
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Opposition lawmakers have disclosed the names of
about 3,300 wealthy debtors linked to questionable bank loans that
became part of a huge government bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies from the Party of the Democratic Revolution disclosed
the names at a press conference late Wednesday. Computer hackers
hired by the party cracked codes protecting the debtors' list on a
compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the loans ``a great fraud against the nation,'' Pablo
Gomez, head of the party's congressional delegation, assailed the
government and the bail-out agency, saying they pursued ``a policy
of absolute freedom for bankers.'' In the list of suspicious loans
is an album of top-echelon magnates who were close to the
government and fell into deep financial trouble after the currency
crash of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a loan to a brother of Rogelio Montemayor Seguy, the
current director of Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil
company, and another to a relative of a governing party senator.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed is a $5 million loan for a car race track belonging
to Jorge Hank Rhon, the son of a veteran governing party
politician.
</P>
<P>
   A $422,000 loan went directly to the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the state of Jalisco. The party
defaulted on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The list was compiled by a Canadian auditor, Michael Mackey. The
congress hired him in 1998 to make a thorough audit of the bank
rescue. He drew up the list after sifting through tens of thousands
of loans in the bail-out agency's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   His list details loans totaling $7.8 billion that Mackey found
to be seriously irregular, either because they did not meet bank
credit standards or because they were made to people and companies
with direct business ties to the lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey's list also includes loans to several prominent bankers
who are known to be facing criminal prosecution for huge frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Legal action has begun in hundreds of cases from the Mackey
list.
</P>
<P>
   The entire bank rescue so far has cost Mexican taxpayers $100
billion. The government jumped in to shore up the financial system
when it nearly collapsed in 1995, as interest rates skyrocketed and
millions of Mexicans defaulted on their debts. Finance officials
were obliged to act because all Mexican bank deposits at that time
were fully government insured.
</P>
<P>
   The officials argued that they did what they had to do to avert
catastrophe. Opposition lawmakers charge that that gave the banks
the opportunity to fob off billions of dollars in illegal loans
that are now being paid by the taxpayers. They say that the bailout
agency should not have agreed to pay for those loans.
</P>
<P>
   The records of the bail-out agency are confidential, protected
by bank secrecy laws, as was Mackey's auditing report. By agreement
with the parties in congress, Mackey put the list of potentially
illegal loans on one compact disc and provided separate secret
codes to each of the main parties, so that they could see the list
if they all agreed.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo and his party, the PRI, refused to
provide their code and blocked every opposition effort to release
information on the suspect loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, was alone in
demanding disclosure until May. Then, in a flourish during a
televised debate among presidential candidates, Vicente Fox trumped
the PRD by handing over an envelope that he said contained his
party's secret codes to the disc. Fox, from the center-right
National Action Party, or PAN won the July 2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out those codes were not the right ones. Fauzi
Hamdan, a federal deputy who is PAN's point man on the bail-out,
admitted that he gave Fox mistaken codes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdan has made it clear that he does not agree with the
opposition releasing bail-out information in violation of their
accord with Mackey. In the end he did turn over PAN's codes, but
the PRI did not offer its numbers.
</P>
<P>
   More than $200 million in loans went to three construction
companies that grew into giants during the years when the Mexican
government proffered a steady flow of contracts. A loan to Ignacio
Santos de Hoyo the PRI senator from the state of Nuevo Leon, was
for $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bail-out agency said that criminal or civil
legal action has been brought in about 300 of the cases on the
Mackey list.

ILL GRUDZIELANEK HEADED FOR DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is not the way the Los Angeles Dodgers wanted
to begin the second half. Not with second baseman Mark Grudzielanek
heading for the disabled list and not with catcher Todd Hundley
unable to throw a ball until the end of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But such is life for the Dodgers, who received bad news on both
players before Thursday's interleague game with the Angels at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was diagnosed with a viral infection. Team doctors
have told Grudzielanek to keep away from the ballpark, mainly
because they don't know what's causing it. He's expected to be put
on the 15-day disabled list today, retroactive to last Friday, and
utility player Mike Metcalfe is expected to be recalled from
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek underwent tests at Centinela Hospital Medical
Center. Team officials said doctors are hopeful that test results
available today will give the club a better indication of what's
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had the virus, the flu, but Grud's got real bad
headaches and some joint discomfort,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``The recommendation from the doctor is that we do
(put him on the DL).''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Grudzielanek's loss mean a shift in the infield,
which could lead to shortstop Alex Cora playing second base again
but also throws another monkey wrench into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek has batted solely in the second spot in the order,
and is hitting .303 with five homers and 31 RBI. He's also turned
into a solid second baseman, making 10 errors but showing constant
improvement in his move from shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays showed Hundley has a nondisplaced fracture on the tip of
his right thumb, but he's hopeful of returning for the upcoming
Pittsburgh series. The fracture is under the thumbnail and he's
available to play when the pain allows him to. Hundley said he
could pinch-hit left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shooting for Sunday or Monday,'' Hundley said.
``Basically, it's getting all the swelling down so I can throw a
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Trade talk: The Dodgers are trying to acquire a starting
pitcher before the trading deadline, but they keep hearing the same
thing when it comes to a deal. Other teams want rookie right-hander
Eric Gagne, but the Dodgers front office remains unwilling to
include him in a deal.
</P>
<P>
   They've talked with Baltimore about right-hander Scott Erickson,
sources said. The Dodgers also talked to Philadelphia about Andy
Ashby before he was traded to Atlanta. The Dodgers also talked to
the Phillies about Curt Schilling, but Gagne would have to be
included in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers are prepared to do everything to keep
Gagne, and instead would like to package right-hander Darren
Dreifort, catching prospect Angel Pena, whom the organization has
soured on, and a minor- league pitcher for any deal they make,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson pitched a perfect
inning in a rehab appearance for Triple-A Albuquerque against Iowa,
his sixth minor-league appearance. But the Dodgers are waiting for
Chad Kreuter's suspension to end after Saturday's game, and for
Hundley and Grudzielanek to get healthy before adding Olson to the
mix. . . . With lefty Carlos Perez slated to begin his five-game
suspension Sunday, right-hander Mike Judd is expected to be
recalled from Albuquerque.

 c.2000 San Bernardino Sunn  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ No less than Michael Johnson calls this ``the
greatest track meet in the world,'' and who are we to argue with
the fastest long-sprint runner in world history?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials begin today and conclude
July 23 at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium and, indeed, a strong
case can be made that this is the premier meet on the planet _ both
for the caliber of its competition and the under-the-gun pressure
on its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of the few countries that determines
its Olympic track team on the basis of one meet. A pulled hamstring
or a bad breakfast can ruin four years of training and render
``best in the world'' rankings irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly about pressure, because if you don't get in the
top three, you don't make the Olympic team,'' Johnson said
Thursday. ``It's the most pressure an athlete is in.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains the globe's preeminent track power. In
several events, particularly the sprints and hurdles, it is more
difficult to make the U.S. team than to medal at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Only the three top qualifiers go to the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney. Johnson suggests the U.S. someday should keep open ``wild
cards'' for defending Olympic champions or world-record holders
``who get food- poisoning or whatever'' at the trials, but for now
it remains a do-or-die proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Multitalented Marion Jones comes to Sacramento with the most
ambitious schedule, hoping to qualify for three individual events
(long jump, 100 and 200) in her drive to become the first track and
field athlete to win five gold medals (including the two relays) in
one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones runs in the 100-meter quarterfinals today and attempts to
qualify for Sunday's long jump finals. It shouldn't be difficult,
but getting past the U.S. trials is never a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are, no matter what you did last week or last year,
no matter what you say, you've still got to go out and run the
races and make the team,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien remains Exhibit A in the U.S. Trials nightmare
museum. He was the decathlon world-record holder and overwhelming
favorite to win gold in Barcelona in 1992, but he failed to clear a
height in the pole vault at the '92 trials and didn't get his
Olympic gold until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, if you get through our Olympic trials, you'll
do fine at the Olympics, because our trials are so tough,'' said
Antonio Pettigrew, a veteran 400-meter man.
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew ought to know. He is a three-time world champion and
member of the fastest 400-meter relay team in world history, but he
has never gotten past the U.S. trials in three previous tries.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinters expect good times because of deep competition, a fast
track at Sacramento State and hot weather. Highs in the mid-90s are
forecast for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see a different level of women's
sprinting,'' said Inger Miller, world champion in the 200 and
Jones' top rival. ``I think this track can give us some good times.

 SPELLING OF NEWSPAPER (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ No less than Michael Johnson calls this ``the
greatest track meet in the world,'' and who are we to argue with
the fastest long-sprint runner in world history?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials begin today and conclude
July 23 at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium and, indeed, a strong
case can be made that this is the premier meet on the planet _ both
for the caliber of its competition and the under-the-gun pressure
on its athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of the few countries that determines
its Olympic track team on the basis of one meet. A pulled hamstring
or a bad breakfast can ruin four years of training and render
``best in the world'' rankings irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly about pressure, because if you don't get in the
top three, you don't make the Olympic team,'' Johnson said
Thursday. ``It's the most pressure an athlete is in.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains the globe's preeminent track power. In
several events, particularly the sprints and hurdles, it is more
difficult to make the U.S. team than to medal at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Only the three top qualifiers go to the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney. Johnson suggests the U.S. someday should keep open ``wild
cards'' for defending Olympic champions or world-record holders
``who get food- poisoning or whatever'' at the trials, but for now
it remains a do-or-die proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Multitalented Marion Jones comes to Sacramento with the most
ambitious schedule, hoping to qualify for three individual events
(long jump, 100 and 200) in her drive to become the first track and
field athlete to win five gold medals (including the two relays) in
one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones runs in the 100-meter quarterfinals today and attempts to
qualify for Sunday's long jump finals. It shouldn't be difficult,
but getting past the U.S. trials is never a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are, no matter what you did last week or last year,
no matter what you say, you've still got to go out and run the
races and make the team,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien remains Exhibit A in the U.S. Trials nightmare
museum. He was the decathlon world-record holder and overwhelming
favorite to win gold in Barcelona in 1992, but he failed to clear a
height in the pole vault at the '92 trials and didn't get his
Olympic gold until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, if you get through our Olympic trials, you'll
do fine at the Olympics, because our trials are so tough,'' said
Antonio Pettigrew, a veteran 400-meter man.
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew ought to know. He is a three-time world champion and
member of the fastest 400-meter relay team in world history, but he
has never gotten past the U.S. trials in three previous tries.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinters expect good times because of deep competition, a fast
track at Sacramento State and hot weather. Highs in the mid-90s are
forecast for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see a different level of women's
sprinting,'' said Inger Miller, world champion in the 200 and
Jones' top rival. ``I think this track can give us some good times.
And it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's top story lines: Jones attempting to move along in the
long jump and 100; Johnson going in the first round of the men's
400 (he holds the world record in the 200 and 400), and world's

ATTORNEY SUES TO RECOVER DNC MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An attorney known for filing police misconduct
lawsuits against Los Angeles filed a class-action suit against the
mayor and City Council this week demanding the return of a $2
million bailout to the Democratic National Convention host
committee and seeking a court order to block the final $2 million
payout.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Steven Yagman, who has brought dozens of police
misconduct lawsuits against the city and the Police Department,
filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court on behalf of city
taxpayers including plaintiff Richard Abcarian of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the early promise of the City Council that no tax money
would be spent on this convention,'' said Abcarian, a retired
English professor. ``It's essentially very simple: A promise is a
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks that the city recoup $2 million paid to the host
committee and refrain from paying an additional $2 million the city
has said it is prepared to pay after the convention, to be held
Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   If the city is unable to retrieve the money paid, the suit seeks
to force Mayor Richard Riordan and 14 of the 15 members of the City
Council to repay the money from their personal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The suit names as defendants each council member except Jackie
Goldberg, who rescinded her support for the bailout after her
colleagues abandoned their support for her demand that Pershing
Square be designated as a gathering place for protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that city leaders violated state law prohibiting
public bodies from using public dollars for gifts. The payment
``was made in violation of the public trust,'' according to the
lawsuit. ``This gift of public funds was made in violation of
defendants' promise to Los Angeles taxpayers that no public funds
would be given to the convention or its promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Austin, a spokesman for the DNC host committee, called the
lawsuit ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in terms of whether or not this is constitutional, he
might want to look at the precedent of Chicago, New York and other
cities who have invested far more money than Los Angeles has in the
convention planning process.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin also said taxpayers will benefit from the predicted $135
million to be pumped into the local economy as a result of the
convention and ``a priceless opportunity to step into the national
spotlight and shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan _ who aggressively lobbied the council to approve the
funding and even contributed $1 million of his own funds to the
host committee _ had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick said she consistently voted against the
$4 million payout but declined to comment further, saying she had
not seen the suit and would await advice from the City Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit describes the plaintiffs, led by Abcarian, as ``Los
Angeles taxpayers whose tax payments have been used to make an
illegal gift, and who have been sold out by their elected
representatives and who again will be sold out by them.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled for Friday in U.S. District Court Judge
Christina Snyder's courtroom. Lawyers in the City Attorney's Office
were preparing for the hearing but declined comment.

CITY NATIONAL CORP. BEATS PROJECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ City National Corp., parent of the
largest bank headquartered in Southern California, reported
Thursday a 28 percent increase in earnings for the second quarter,
due to high-interest income.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills-based owner of City National Bank exceeded
Wall Street estimates by a penny a share. The stock closed Thursday
at $35.56, down $3.06, or 7.9 percent, on heavy volume of 927,400
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   City National earned $33.4 million, or 68 cents per share, for
the quarter ended June 30, compared with net income of $26.1
million, or 55 cents a share, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total net interest and noninterest income, the banking
industry's equivalent to revenues, both showed increases due to the
result of strong loan and deposit growth and a higher prime rate.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose 37 percent to $107.8 million, compared with
$78.7 million for the second quarter of 1999. Noninterest income
continued its strong growth, increasing 24 percent to $26.8 million
from $21.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a penny ahead of expectations because the company
benefited from rising interest rates,'' said Campbell Channey, an
analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in interest income City National Bank has been
enjoying after a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal
Reserve should taper off by the end of the year, said Channey.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate loans rose 72 percent from $0.8 billion to $1.3
billion, while average deposits gained 38 percent during the second
quarter to $6.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These results reflect, in part, the integration of The Pacific
Bank, acquired in February and American Pacific State Bank,
acquired in August 1999, into City National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``City National's strong financial performance this quarter
demonstrates that our clients want to continue to invest in their
businesses, so we see our deposits and loans continuing to
expand,'' said Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive
officer of City National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith added, ``As people become even more aware of City
National Bank, especially in the (San Fernando) Valley, we will
continue to grow our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, City National said no shares were repurchased in the
second quarter. Since the current stock buyback program began on
July 29, the company has repurchased 731,100 shares for a cost of
$23.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The shares purchased under the buyback program have been
reissued for acquisitions, upon the exercise of stock options, and
for other general corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
   City National bank has assets of $8.7 billion and 41 offices in
Southern California including Encino, Studio City, Sherman Oaks,
Sun Valley, Woodland Hills, North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Granada
Hills, Burbank, Northridge and Valencia.

RANGERS STUN DIAMONDBACKS IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Rangers' longest road trip of the season, one they
hope will push them back into the divisional race, is off to a
wildly thrilling and highly successful start.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, lifeless at the plate for most of the night,
overcame Arizona's 4-1 lead with five runs in the ninth and
defeated the Diamondbacks, 6-4, last night at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea delivered the game-winning hit _ a bases-loaded,
two-out, two-run single off Diamondbacks closer Byung-Hyun Kim. The
victory left the Rangers within 71/2 games of the Seattle Mariners
in the American League West. The Mariners lost to San Diego, 2-1,
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer started the Rangers' winning rally by drawing a
walk. Kim struck out Ivan Rodriguez but then hit Rafael Palmeiro on
the leg with a 1-2 pitch. Frank Catalanotto followed with a
broken-bat single to right, scoring Greer and moving Palmeiro to
third.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Gabe Kapler, but manager Johnny Oates pinch hit
David Segui, the Rangers' designated hitter who didn't start
because of National League rules.
</P>
<P>
   Segui smacked a line drive to center and center fielder Steve
Finley tried for a sliding catch. He missed. The ball sailed under
his glove and all the way to the wall, scoring both runners and
sending Segui to third with a two-run triple to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Lamb was walked intentionally, Kim struck out Royce
Clayton but walked Dave Martinez to load the bases. Alicea then
lined a single to right to put the Rangers ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks blew a chance to break the game open in the
eighth after they loaded the bases with one out against Rangers
reliever Francisco Cordero. Instead Mike Venafro and Jeff Zimmerman
bailed out Cordero with a huge assist from Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   With the infield in, Venafro got Tony Womack to hit a slow
grounder to Lamb, who charged hard and fielded the ball cleanly but
bounced his throw to the plate. Rodriguez saved him from disaster
by making a backhanded short-hop stop to get the force out.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell, who almost devastated the Rangers with two home runs
off Rangers starter Rick Helling, then hit a spinning grounder that
shortstop Royce Clayton couldn't get, an infield single that scored
one run. But Zimmerman ended the inning by getting Luis Gonzalez to
fly out to center, keeping the Rangers within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's terrible ninth followed eight brilliant innings by starter
Brian Anderson, who held the Rangers to one run on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers managed only three singles in the first seven
innings against Anderson, and none of the three base runners were
able to advance past first base. The Rangers also failed to get the
leadoff batter on base in any of those seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Scott Sheldon broke up Anderson's bid for a shutout
with a two-out home run in the eighth inning. Up to that point, the
night seemed to belong to the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got a run off Helling in the third when Bell,
with two outs, jumped on a 1-0 pitch and smashed it high and deep
into the Diamondbacks' bullpen down the left-field line for a home
run. The Diamondbacks then mounted another rally in the fourth but
Helling pitched brilliantly to escape without allowing a run.
</P>
<P>
   He started the inning with a walk to Matt Williams, then gave up
a double to Steve Finley to put runners on second and third. That
brought up Erubiel Durazo, who fouled off three sliders, then took
a fastball for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Helling walked Damian Miller on a 3-2 fastball just outside to
load the bases but caught Travis Lee looking on a 2-2 fastball for
another big strikeout. Anderson then ended the inning with a hard
grounder right at second base Luis Alicea.
</P>
<P>
   But Helling's reprieve didn't last long. Tony Womack lined a
single to left to start the fifth and then Bell lined a 1-1
fastball over the right-field fence for a two-run homer, giving the
Diamondbacks a 3-0 lead.

</P>
<P>
   Schumacher makes strong case as best driver going
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Judging who is the best marathon runner or who is the best
100-meter sprinter is a simple procedure _ just line them up and
see who gets to the finish first.
</P>
<P>
   Judging who is the best race-car driver is more difficult. Just
lining then up and having them battle for a certain distance will
determine the winner for that day, but it might not tell you who is
the best driver.
</P>
<P>
   The car the winner drove might be a lot faster than the car the
best driver was steering. The best driver on a starting grid cannot
win in the worst car, and the worst driver in the field can't win
in the best car.
</P>
<P>
   So trying to figure out who is the best driver in the world is
not an exact science. It really is just an educated guess based on
a number of factors _ record, car and team, and status among other
drivers who have raced against that particular driver.
</P>
<P>
   Using all those factors, the Chronicle has compiled a list of
the 10 best drivers in the world today, along with the 10 best who
no longer compete regularly.
</P>
<P>
   We also have lists for the 10 best _ active and inactive _ in
each type of racing, along with a top-10 list of future stars.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Beg to differ. Opinions vary and people disagree, even
within the racing community. There are no guaranteed answers, just
like there are no guaranteed winners each week.
</P>
<P>
   But the selections have been made and the consensus as to the
best racer in the world is Michael Schumacher in Formula One. The
31-year-old German has dominated the circuit this season and is
well on his way to giving Ferrari its first driver's championship
since Jody Scheckter in 1979. It will be the third F1 title for
Schumacher, who carried the Benetton team to its only championships
in 1994 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Schumacher won a championship, his talent was
apparent. In 1993, Tom Walkinshaw was the technical director for
the Benetton team. That year he became the first man to proclaim
Schumacher as the world's best driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs Ayrton Senna or Alain Prost?'' Walkinshaw said. ``We
have Michael Schumacher. He is the best driver I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would claim Benetton had the best mechanical package when
Schumacher won his first two titles. Some might argue Ferrari
finally has caught up with the McLaren team and Ferrari does have
the best car this season, but Schumacher has been so dominant that
it is clear he would be winning for either team.
</P>
<P>
   What makes him so good? His fellow F1 drivers list these key
components _ amazing reflexes and instincts at high speeds,
absolutely no fear on the track and total ruthlessness during a
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has an uncanny ability to get instant speed in any
situation,'' Ferrari director Jean Todt said. ``And he has that
competitive aggression that makes him the driver he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter characteristic won't win Schumacher any popularity
contests, but it has won him a lot of races.
</P>
<P>
   It also has cost him a few _ such as the 1997 F1 finale in Spain
where Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve were battling for the
championship. Schumacher turned into Villeneuve on a curve and was
disqualified, ending Schumacher's chance at the title.
</P>
<P>
   That all-out attitude is a trait found in most of the top
drivers, including the No. 2 selection _ CART competitor Juan
Montoya. The Colombian is only 24, but his talent and ability are
undeniable after watching what he has accomplished the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He won the CART FedEx championship as a rookie last season. Some
people said anyone could have won driving for the dominant Chip
Ganassi Target team, but Montoya did more with the equipment he had
than anyone ever had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan may be the best driver we've ever seen in America,''
Ganassi said. ``I don't know how to rate him with drivers from
previous decades, but I know he's pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya won a rookie-record seven races and earned seven poles.
Perhaps the most amazing statistic was that he led in 15 of the 20
races on the circuit. Any doubts about his skills were erased in
May when he won the Indianapolis 500 in an IRL car, clearly
outclassing the field in his first race at the Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely Montoya will move to Formula One next season and
drive for Frank Williams, which will be an opportunity to see how
he stacks up against Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan has a natural ability that you can't teach,'' said CART
team owner Mo Nunn, who was Montoya's consultant and team engineer
last season. ``He has amazing raw talent and he is a very confident
young man.''
</P>
<P>
   The first American on the top 10 list is a man approaching half
a century on the planet _ Dale Earnhardt. At age 49, Earnhardt is
driving as aggressively as he did a decade ago when he was starting
a string of four Winston Cup championships in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite driving a Monte Carlo that has a clear aerodynamic
disadvantage to the Taurus and Grand Prix cars on superspeedways,
Earnhardt is No. 2 in the points standings and shooting for a
record eighth championship.
</P>
<P>
   The next two drivers on the list also are Winston Cup
competitors Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, is going through a transition this season after
losing crew chief Ray Evernham, but Gordon still has won twice this
year on tracks that couldn't be more different _ the superspeedway
at Talladega and the road course at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   The win at Sonoma, Calif., was the sixth consecutive road-course
victory for Gordon, prompting more speculation about he would do in
Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   We might never know because Gordon is making so much money in
NASCAR that he has no incentive to prove himself in another series
the way top drivers did in the past. But his 51 victories and three
titles show he can win anywhere under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is the only driver without a championship on the top-10
list, but many times winning a title involves being in the right
place at the right time. That hasn't happened for Martin, but he
might be the most respected driver in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only flaw in Martin's game, something many people
see as an asset and an example of his character, is that he is just
too nice on the track. He doesn't have the killer instinct that
some of his opponents possess. He would rather finish second than
win in an unsportsmanlike fashion.
</P>
<P>
   A good gauge of Martin's driving skill is his four championships
in the IROC series, which pits 12 top drivers in identically
prepared Pontiac Firebirds. Martin won three consecutive IROC
titles from 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth on the list is CART driver Michael Andretti, who won the
championship in 1991 and has been the series runner-up five times.
His father Mario has said several times that he believes Michael is
a better driver than he was, but the competition is tougher now.
Michael's 39 career victories are tops among active CART drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Formula One driver Mika Hakkinen, who won the last two F1
titles, makes the list, as does defending Winston Cup champion Dale
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has gotten better every year in a 20-year career where
he has paid his dues and learned how to run up front.
</P>
<P>
   The last two choices on the list might be the most controversial
_ Funny Car champion John Force and World of Outlaws racer Steve
Kinser.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful Force could drive a car that he had to turn left
or right at high speeds, but he is the master at stepping on the
throttle and going straight at more than 300 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He won nine NHRA championships in the 1990s and passed Bob
Glidden this season for the most career victories _ now 86 and
counting. Force is still going strong at 51 and will go down in the
books as the greatest drag racer of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Force in drag racing, Kinser is the undisputed king of
sprint-car racing on dirt. At age 44, he has won 15 World of
Outlaws championships and has more than 440 ``A'' feature victories
in his career. His 56 victories in 1987 stand as the national
short-track record.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is, the top 10 of 2000 _ subject to change, of
course, in 2001.

3. Dale Earnhardt _ Still going strong at 49 and has a realistic
shot at the historic eighth Winston Cup championship. &QL;

points and will be driving in Winston Cup soon for Richard
Childress. &QL; 
5. Kurt Busch _ At age 20, he became the youngest driver ever to

INTERNAL FIGHTING HAMPERING NEW SAFETY AGENCY  &HT;     BY BERNADETTE TANSEY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internal fighting and a muddled management
structure are hindering the work of a new federal safety agency
investigating the fatal 1999 Tosco refinery fire near Martinez and
other industrial accidents, federal investigators said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office review tracks closely with
the findings of a Chronicle investigation in April that found
management conflicts at the board have hampered probes into
workplace accidents across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigators said an independent oversight agency
should be appointed to monitor the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board, where a majority of members are now pressing
the White House to expel the fledgling agency's former chairman
from his board seat.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the small agency 21/2 years ago was greeted with
great optimism by environmentalists, workers and industry groups as
a long-needed '`honest broker'' that would investigate major plant
accidents impartially, with an eye to preventing similar
catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tosco Corp. investigation and other probes suffered when
a feud erupted between founding chairman Paul Hill and the board's
three other members, who said Hill was monopolizing the board's
decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, dismayed by the delays in completing
investigations, sought a General Accounting Office review of the
chemical safety board's problems, and some threatened to wipe out
the agency's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said the three-member board majority,
which took control of the agency after Hill relinquished the
chairmanship in January, has made progress toward getting the work
back on track. But it said the board should have revised its
procedures after former employees and others alleged that
investigations had been compromised by management interference or
bias.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report advised the board to develop methods to avoid
conflicts of interest in the assignment of investigators, permit
the airing and publication of dissenting opinions in accident
reports, and subject its reports to an outside peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board majority has filled two of six vacant
positions for investigators, one of the four current staff
investigators is about to leave. Still, the board expects to
release two accident reports by the end of September, though the
Tosco review may not be finished until October.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigators said the board should contract with
the inspector general's office of another federal agency, which
could initiate its own investigations of agency problems and
establish a hotline for employees to report their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing disagreements between three of the board members
and the former chairman raise questions concerning the board's
future productivity and efficiency,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The three board members maintain the agency is still recovering
from mismanagement under Hill, whom they accused of malfeasance,
inefficiency and neglect of duty in their petition to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Victoria Valentine said negotiations are
under way for Hill's departure from the agency. Hill could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The board majority supports the recommendation for an outside
inspector general and will consider the accounting office's other
proposals to ensure the objectivity of investigations, said board
member Irv Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We note that although we have not had written policies and
procedures on the items that the GAO identified, all three of the
CSB's (completed) investigation reports have been highly praised
for their objectivity and thoroughness,'' Rosenthal said.

EX-ACE HILL CAN'T AFFORD TO FALTER NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ken Hill began the season as the ace of the
starting rotation, but his spot isn't secure now as the second half
of the season is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels general manager Bill Stoneman has said the club
will go with its five best starters, regardless of experience or
salary. But the club desperately desires at least one veteran
pitcher to lead an otherwise young starting staff into a possible
pennant race. Kent Bottenfield could be that guy, as could Hill.
Tim Belcher is on the disabled list and isn't close to coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Hill started Thursday against the Dodgers and gave up two runs
and four hits but needed 127 pitches to get through six innings. He
has pitched into the seventh inning only once this year and hasn't
pitched seven complete innings all season. He's been knocked out of
a game before finishing four innings four times this season. That
has placed a heavy burden on the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stress with all our guys to be a little more efficient with
their pitch count,'' pitching coach Bud Black said. ``We want them
to be aggressive early in the count. With Ken, a number of times he
gets the first two outs and the third out has eluded him.''
</P>
<P>
   The final few months of this season certainly will be Hill's
last as a member of the Angels. His time in Anaheim has been
littered with injuries, but now the club doesn't have to remain
patient with him if it's in a pennant race come August and
September and he's struggling.
</P>
<P>
   That's a result of the emergence of the organization's young
pitchers, who saved the team in the first half. If Hill falters,
there are others waiting for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis will begin a rehab assignment tonight and
should be ready to return in about two weeks. Ramon Ortiz impressed
the club with eight innings and a victory in a spot start last week
(he's back at Triple-A Edmonton). And Matt Wise has been impressive
at Edmonton (8-4, 3.94 ERA in 16 starts).
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, who will need about three or four rehab starts
before rejoining the starting rotation, is scheduled to throw 50-60
pitches for Single-A Lake Elsinore tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is ``not close'' to throwing again, according to Angels
manager Mike Scioscia. Belcher is on the DL with a strained flexor
muscle in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   __ Memories: Scioscia made his first visit to Dodger Stadium as
a member of the opposition Thursday, but it wasn't quite like his
first visit as a player in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out to center field . . . I was the only one here,''
Scioscia remembered. ``It's great to walk in here, this is a
special ballpark. It has the same meaning it did when I first came
here.''

 ANYBODY GET HIT BY WEINERMOBILE?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Who's zoomin' past whom?
</P>
<P>
   Let's have a contest: Who can get run over or close-called on
the streets of San Francisco by the most unusual or ironic vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   In the past week I've heard from pedestrians claiming to have
had near-death experiences with a school bus, a local TV news van
and (this one reported by Karen Green) a blood-bank truck.
</P>
<P>
   The blood truck incident gets my vote, unless someone checks in
with a story involving a hearse. Or maybe the Oscar Mayer
Weinermobile.
</P>
<P>
   GO AHEAD and build that schlocky San Francisco museum/theme
park, says Aaron Peskin. Just don't build it at Pier 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it part of the airport expansion,'' says Peskin,
candidate for supervisor in the 3rd District.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists could fly into SFO, visit ``San Francisco,'' and fly
home without having to freeze on the Golden Gate Bridge, wait for
hours for the cable cars or get run over by a bloodmobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we still get their airport tax,'' Peskin notes.
</P>
<P>
   SAD NEWS for friends and admirers of Bill Kimpton, the
hotel-restaurant pioneer. He has checked into a Southwest
cancer-treatment center, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Kimpton's life is an amazing story. He was born and raised in
Kansas City and because of dyslexia didn't read until high school.
His first job was as a flunky at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco,
where he literally started at the ground floor and worked his way
down, demoted almost immediately from the front desk to the wine
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   He became a business dynamo. After many successes, such as
taking KFC public, Kimpton started a hotel-restaurant empire based
on the concept of turning a marginal hotel into a luxury boutique
hotel, and installing a killer restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimpton Group had 28 hotels on the West Coast, 14 in San
Francisco, including the Sir Francis Drake and the Triton, before
selling recently to Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   DINING DIN is good, many trendy restaurant owners feel, because
it's a sign that the place is full of energy. Hip young diners
don't want to feel like they're eating in a library, unless of
course they're eating in a library.
</P>
<P>
   But when the restaurant is so noisy you have to converse via
charades, that can be a problem, especially if you're lousy at
charades.
</P>
<P>
   Dine, a hot new spot on Mission in SoMa, is the latest local
restaurant to down-sound. Dine hired The Finish Line, an acoustical
treatment firm that has also shushed XYZ, Farallon, Jardiniere and
MC2 (squared).
</P>
<P>
   The tab was a quiet $14,000, and now the din at Dine is fine and
benign. You still can't hear yourself think, but who's thinking?
</P>
<P>
   BIRD LOVERS, skip this item.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the big annual Pigeon Roast in Union Square, where the
Bay Area Rotisserie Friends will roast up some rock dove, aka:
pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   It is absolutely legal, they say, to hunt, kill and eat pigeons.
But if you plan to partake, you must bring an invitation (go to
pigeons &LR; starchefs.com).
</P>
<P>
   The BARF people say the birds are yummy, especially the
cinnamon-honey grilled pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GOOD to peep in on Los Angeles every now and then to make
sure things are still going smoothly down there.
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be:
</P>
<P>
   -- Los Angeles is experiencing a shortage of lifeguards. You can
imagine how many men it must take to replace David Hasselhoff.
</P>
<P>
   -- A man convicted of stealing 55 Oscar statues was sentenced to
six months in jail. Like he's the first guy ever to steal an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   -- Inmates convicted of minor crimes in L.A. are allowed to
serve out their sentences at relatively pleasant suburban jails, if
they can get in. The suburban jails rent out cells, like hotel
rooms. Real Graybar Hotels. Bread and water and dessert cart.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jail rentals produce revenue, many of the little
jails now advertise. Do your time at the Hoosegow Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: The slammer spa. And the community-service 18-hole
litter pick-up detail.

STUDY FINDS POT SAFE FOR AIDS PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  DURBAN, South Africa _ In the first government-sanctioned test
of the effects of marijuana on people infected with the AIDS virus,
a San Francisco study has found that the patients on pot came out
of a 21-day trial just as fit and quite a bit fatter than when they
started.
<P>
   Dr. Donald Abrams, a researcher at the University of California
at San Francisco, reported the results of the one-year, $1 million
study Thursday at the 13th International AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   His findings may be less significant than the fact that research
involving marijuana took place. Abrams secured funding for the
experiment from the National Institute of Drug Abuse only after
years of failed attempts to convince the government that research
was needed on the medical effects of street drugs routinely
consumed by HIV-infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting; it's historic. It confirms that all the states
that have allowed patients to use medical marijuana have not made a
serious mistake,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco Thursday, Dale Gieringer, the California
director of NORML, the national organization seeking to legalize
marijuana, said the Abrams report ``certainly establishes what
we've said all along _ that marijuana is safe and effective and
that the government hasn't got a leg to stand on by preventing its
medical use.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gieringer, thousands of patients are already using
marijuana ``semi-legally'' as a result of the solid victory that
Proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative, scored in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Medical uses of pot are theoretically legal in California as a
result of that vote, but federal drug enforcement officials have
insisted they would enforce the federal ban anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the Californians now using marijuana at the
suggestion of their physicians are AIDS patients, Gieringer said,
and they know it helps subdue the nausea and loss of appetite that
are common side effects of the antiviral medicines they must take.
</P>
<P>
   Medical marijuana is legal in seven other states besides
California: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By design, and at the insistence of government funders, the
Abrams study did not set out to prove or disprove the contention of
medical marijuana advocates that smoking pot can improve the
appetite, body weight and well-being of patients with AIDS, cancer
and other wasting diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' stated goal in this study was to determine whether the
chemical components of marijuana in any way interfered with the
body's ability to break down the components of protease inhibitors.
These are the newest class of antiviral drugs that, taken in
combination with others, have helped thousands of HIV-infected
patients retain the health of their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Previous lab tests had hinted that there could be a problem with
drug-to-drug interaction, because the active ingredients of both
pot and protease drugs are broken down by the same enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   After examining results from 62 subjects who completed the
trials, Abrams concluded that there was no change in the level of
virus in the blood of patients who smoked marijuana or who took
Marinol, a prescription drug containing the active ingredients of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also took a little peek to see if there was any change in
appetite, caloric intake and body composition,'' Abrams said. In
simple terms, did the marijuana give the HIV-infected patients
``the munchies,'' causing them to eat more and gain weight? The
study results show that they certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 patients who smoked marijuana _ three times a day for 21
days _ gained an average of 7.7 pounds during the study period
while 22 patients taking Marinol gained 7 pounds, and the remaining
20 given a placebo gained only 2.9 pounds. The patients assigned to
smoke pot were given three joints of what Abrams called
``government grade'' marijuana, which is about one third as potent
as marijuana commonly sold on the streets or purchased at buyers'
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Patients taking either the Marinol or the placebo were given
unlabeled pills. They did not know whether they were taking the
active ingredient or the dummy pill. One of the curious findings of
the study was that nine of the 20 patients given the dummy pill
thought they were given Marinol.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the marijuana study was an unusual event in the
annals of science. Patients from all around the country who heard
about the study volunteered to enroll in it. They were essentially
locked up in a unit of San Francisco General Hospital for the 21
days of their trial. Those who smoked marijuana had to do so in a
closed room with ventilation, so that secondhand smoke would not
affect the test subjects taking the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Each patient had a refrigerator loaded with snacks next to his
or her bed. The refrigerators were locked at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams acknowledges that the consumption of psychoactive
substances produced some interesting behavior, but he said he will
be reporting on that at a later time. ``You saw what you might
expect from people smoking marijuana in a confined setting for 21
straight days,'' he said. Typically, there were three patients
being tested at the hospital during any given day.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment did produce a number of adverse effects. One
patient who smoked marijuana left the study after experiencing
``neuropsychiatric symptoms.'' Among those taking Marinol, one left
with neuropsychiatric symptoms; one quit after suffering headaches
and nausea; and one patient died 58 days after completing the test
from an internal hemorrhage that is believed to have been unrelated
to the study.
</P>
<P>
   In California, San Mateo County health officials said Thursday
they have received ``informal and conditional approval'' for a
somewhat similar marijuana study from the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, and are awaiting the required approval from the Food
and Drug Administration plus authority to obtain the marijuana from
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ron Robertson, chief operating officer at San Mateo
Community General Hospital, the county's proposal would involve
AIDS patients smoking marijuana or placebo as outpatients rather
than being confined to a hospital setting during the controlled
clinical trial.

L.A. CITY COUNCIL BLOCKS PRATT DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking advantage of the absence of four
colleagues, four other Los Angeles City Council members blocked a
$4.5 million settlement with Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt because they
wanted to pay him as much as $10 million for his 27 years of false
imprisonment, the Daily News learned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Council members Rita Walters, Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden and
Mark Ridley-Thomas successfully prevented the council from signing
off on the $4.5 million deal during a closed-session meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, brokered by the City Attorney's Office and Pratt
attorney Johnny Cochran Jr., needed an OK from eight of the city's
15 council members. But with only 11 council members present, the
four dissenters had enough votes to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The council is scheduled to take up the matter at a closed
session during Friday's City Council meeting. At least one council
member who didn't attend Wednesday's meeting _ mayoral candidate
Joel Wachs of Studio City _ said he will vote for the deal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I'm going to agree to give more money,'' Wachs
said through a spokesman. ``We have so many basic city services
that I'd rather use this money for.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven members voting to support the settlement were Laura
Chick, Mike Feuer, Mike Hernandez, Cindy Miscikowski, Nick Pacheco,
Alex Padilla and Rudy Svorinich Jr. Absent were members Hal
Bernson, John Ferraro and Ruth Galanter, in addition to Wachs.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson and Ferraro had excused absences, according to records
in the City Clerk's Office. The same records show that Galanter and
Wachs attended earlier portions of the council meeting and do not
indicate a reason for their absence from the closed session.
</P>
<P>
   City officials who support the settlement say it will set an
important precedent for the lawsuits expected from the Rampart
Division corruption case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a good deal that was approved by Pratt and
his attorney and the courts,'' said one official, who asked not to
be identified. ``And, we could say to the people in the Rampart
case, `Look, here we gave a guy $4.5 million for 27 years in prison
and you want more than that for 22 months?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if the council (pays Pratt more), they'll just open up
the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walters on Thursday dismissed that argument, and said Pratt
was entitled to a larger payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precedent on Rampart has already been set by the behavior
of the police,'' said Walters, who would not discuss specific
figures she thought Pratt ought to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should just say here's the key to the bank,
take what you will. But, they took so long to negotiate and the sum
came out so small compared to 27 years of a man's life. We stole 27
years of a man's life _ the prime years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a penalty. We pay out some pretty handsome
sums for things that don't reach this level of significance,''
Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other notable settlements by the city in recent years,
Rodney King received $3.8 million for the infamous beating he
suffered at the hands of Los Angeles police officers in Lake View
Terrace in 1991. And Clarence Chance and Benjamin Powell were
awarded $9 million collectively in 1993 for being wrongly convicted
and spending 17 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was freed from state prison in 1997 after a long legal
battle in which a judge said crucial information had been withheld
in the murder case against the former Black Panther leader.
</P>
<P>
   He had been convicted for the 1968 slaying of a woman on a Santa
Monica tennis court, even though he contended he was more than 400
miles away at the time. The chief witness against him had a
criminal record that officials failed to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, the city would be held liable for
about $3 million and the FBI would pay the remaining amount for its
role in helping convict Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to contact Pratt and Cochran on Thursday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   An official who witnessed the debate said Ridley-Thomas
questioned how the settlement came about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He argued that the city paid $3 million for land-use cases and
wanted to know how it was decided to pay $4.5 million to Pratt,''
the official said. ``None of the people from the City Attorney's
Office could answer that, so he voted against the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden and Goldberg also questioned the size of the settlement
and whether more should be paid out, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said it would be unusual for
the council to override a settlement negotiated between the two
sides, and the rarity of it could be a sign of concern on the part
of council members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do settle for more, it would reflect their belief of
the tremendous injustice done to (Pratt),'' Chemerinsky said,
adding he does not believe it would affect any cases coming out of
the Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   Since allegations surfaced last year that anti-gang officers
framed, beat and shot innocent people in the Rampart area, more
than 20 officers have been fired, suspended, relieved of duty or
have quit. Officials are reviewing hundreds of cases that the
officers were involved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the city attorney would like to use this as a
benchmark, but each case is settled on its own,'' Chemerinsky said.

 AIDS FIGHT GETS BOOST FROM HOUSE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the world's attention focused on the
incredible devastation AIDS is wreaking on sub-Saharan Africa, a
bipartisan House majority Thursday approved a $42 million increase
in funding to combat the disease's march across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, many of them stunned by news of the epidemic's toll
coming out of an international AIDS conference this week in South
Africa, amended a broader $13.3 billion foreign spending bill to
provide the added funding. It still requires Senate approval and
faces an uphill fight for President Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators said the House's 261-to-156 endorsement of the
amendment, co-sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., showed
Congress is committed to helping Africa battle a disease that has
infected 24.5 million people and made orphans of millions of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we saw today was a recognition of the tragedy and
the devastation of the HIV-AIDS pandemic and the willingness of
Congress to begin to at least do the right thing on this issue,''
said Lee, who recently returned from the 13th International AIDS
Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would increase funding for international HIV/AIDS
treatment and prevention from $202 million to $244 million
annually, in line with a White House request. It would be offset by
reductions in military aid to poor U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   The issue sparked an emotional debate on the House floor that
saw conservative Republicans joining moderates and Democrats in
calling for decisive action and was all the more remarkable because
many influential lawmakers support the military spending that will
be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bipartisan vote, ... and it was very significant,''
Lee said. ``This was not a Republican or a Democratic issue. This
is a moral issue that requires a moral response. It's about human
beings and it's about life and death, and if you look at the vote
you will see that.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who visited Africa
in December, told colleagues the AIDS epidemic there is ``the moral
imperative of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   International recognition of the scope of the human and economic
damage caused by HIV and AIDS in Africa has risen sharply during
the past year as statistics paint an increasingly shocking picture.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34.3 million people in the world who have AIDS, 24.5
million are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to estimates from
UNAIDS, an umbrella group for the United Nations, the World Bank
and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 million children in sub-Saharan Africa have lost
either their mother or both parents to the epidemic, and life
expectancy is expected to decline sharply. In Zimbabwe, for
example, life expectancy is estimated to drop from the current 61
years to 33 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 5.4 million new HIV infections worldwide,
with 4 million of them in Africa. Last year 2.8 million people died
of AIDS, 85 percent of them in Africa. The U.S. Census Bureau
projects that Africa will have 71 million fewer people in 2010 as a
result of AIDS, in part because of the death of women of
child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and others contend that AIDS could stymie
economic growth in Africa for decades, much as the bubonic plague
left Europe struggling centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back, I talked to members of Congress,'' Lee said.
``I believe people really realized that a vote on this amendment
sent the signal that we do intend to be on the right side of
history, both in a moral sense and in the sense that we are part of
the world community and have a responsibility to put this pandemic
in check.''
</P>
<P>
   The House measure must still be reconciled with a different
version of the foreign operations bill passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And although the House measure fulfills President Clinton's
request to increase AIDS spending, it still faces an uphill battle.
That's because the foreign spending bill it is part of falls short
of what the White House has proposed, and White House officials
pledged to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said UNAIDS estimates put the cost of fighting the worldwide
epidemic at $3 billion annually. Lee is sponsoring a bill called
the World Bank AIDS Marshall Plan to increase international AIDS
funding further.

   COLOMBIA-MILITARY (El Sando, Colombia) _ A three-day rampage of
torture, rape and killing by a paramilitary group took place in
this tiny village last February, with no effort by military and
police units just a few miles away to stop the slaughter. The
incident _ at the very moment when President Clinton was pushing an
aid package to step up antidrug efforts in Colombia _ strikes at
the heart of the debate over the growing American backing of the
Colombian military. For years the U.S. government and human rights
groups have had reservations about the Colombian military
leadership, its human rights record and its collaboration with
paramilitary units. By Larry Rohter.

<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Thurmont, Md.) _ During President Clinton's
seven years in office, no world leader has journeyed more often to
the White House than Yasser Arafat. The Palestinian leader has met
Clinton there a dozen times, and his image in Washington has become
almost commonplace. In turn, Clinton made the risky gesture of
being the first American president to visit Arafat on his home turf
in Gaza. In the coming days, as the Camp David summit rolls towards
a climax, the White House will see whether that investment can be
made to pay in a peace settlement. Clinton believes that
personalities and relationships can fundamentally alter history,
and according to his aides, he is banking on his affinity with
Arafat, and with the Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, to make a
critical difference at Camp David. By Jane Perlez.

   BUSH-BROTHER (Tallahassee, Fla.) _ If Gov. George W. Bush is
still hunting for a running mate, here's an ideal choice: He's a
popular young governor from the fourth largest state, one where
Democrats hope to compete ferociously. He is something of a policy
wonk, a nice balance to Bush's celebrated aversion to policy
minutiae. He is beloved among Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc.

SOX SAVED IN NINTH BY DAUBACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a night of many happy returns for the Red Sox. Pedro
Martinez, healthy and haughty, was back for the first time in 18
days, and so, too, was the bottom-of-the-ninth comeback, not seen
in these parts since . . . well, it was so long ago that no one in
the Sox clubhouse could remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not this year,'' said first baseman Brian Daubach, whose
two-out, two-strike, two-run double in the ninth off Mets closer
Armando Benitez lifted the Sox to a 4-3 win, made possible when
Mets shortstop Melvin Mora kicked away a certain double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with Daubach's memory, nor his timing. This was
the first time this season the Sox have come from behind in their
last at-bat, on a night in which Martinez left after seven innings
deadlocked, 2-2, having surrendered a tying home run to Jay Payton,
Nomar Garciaparra's Georgia Tech buddy who also doubled home the
Mets' first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge,'' said Scott Hatteberg, who pinch hit in the
ninth and drew a walk that touched off the winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I can remember one homestand where we seemed to win
every game in dramatic fashion. Not only with big hits, but lots of
things. This is the first time this year I can remember this
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have closed it out and should have closed it out.
Maybe that's happened for us before, but we haven't capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had taken a 3-2 lead in the eighth when Carl Everett,
the Sox All-Star and former Met, misplayed Mike Piazza's base hit
into an error that allowed Edgardo Alfonzo to score from first. But
after Hatteberg drew a one-out walk in the ninth batting for Ed
Sprague, the best-fielding team in the National League made a rare
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, playing shortstop in the absence of Rey Ordonez, the
all-world acrobat out for the season with a fractured elbow, muffed
Jose Offerman's ground ball just to the left of second base. Pinch
runner Manny Alexander, instead of being erased at second, wound up
at third when he advanced on Jeff Frye's liner to center, setting
up Daubach's duel with Benitez, who blew just his fourth save in 23
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we needed something like that,'' Frye said of the error
by the normally sure-handed Mora, who said he took his eye off the
ball as it glanced off his glove. ``We haven't had too many breaks
like that, but it wouldn't have meant anything if Dauber doesn't
come through there. I can't think of a much better way to start the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with both the Yankees and Blue Jays losing their
interleague exercises against the Marlins and Phillies,
respectively, allowing the Sox to climb within 1 1/2 games of the
lead in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of things happened,'' said Daubach, who lashed his
winning hit to the base of the right-field fence one pitch after
umpire Angel Hernandez decided not to ring him up on a 1-and-2
fastball from Benitez that had the sellout crowd of 33,894 audibly
relieved the game wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The error. The borderline call, my ball not bouncing out or a
fan not touching it. Maybe things are finally going our way,'' said
Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who acknowledged he doesn't have
the best view of the strike zone from the third base dugout,
thought Daubach was done on the previous pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the crowd reacted, it looked like strike three,'' said
Valentine, whose starter, Bobby Jones, had shut out the Sox until
Everett singled and Morgan Burkhart homered in the sixth to give
the Sox a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't call it . . . too bad. If that was strike three,
then we're off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach candidly admitted what would have happened had he
elected to take a hack at the 1-and-2 pitch, which was belt high
and hugging the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said. ``I would have struck out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he delivered some 10 o'clock drama that has been absent
most nights on the Fens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation, we start the second half, a game like this, one
strike away from the game going the other way, a great at-bat from
Daubach, that's really got to pick you up,'' said manager Jimy
Williams, who had Martinez on a pitch count and lifted his ace
after Martinez threw 104 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn right,'' Williams said. ``I know it picks me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Daubach said, he was reminded of his defining moment from
last August, the bases-clearing double he hit off the Monster
against Oakland after narrowly missing a grand slam foul down the
right-field line the pitch before.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure,'' he said. ``The team got really hot after that.
Maybe this will get us going again.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``But I also went in a slump after that hit. I don't
want that to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has now gone five weeks without a win. The last time he
pitched in four games without a win was nearly two years ago, in
September 1998. But after whiffing 10, walking one, and holding the
Mets to five hits, he pronounced himself satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it any way we can,'' he said. ``I don't care how we
win it. As long as the `W' is in our clubhouse.''

DODGERS WIN IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Anaheim Angels began their second half loose
and knowing they have a realistic shot at winning their division.
The Los Angeles Dodgers opened their post-All-Star schedule with a
team meeting in which manager Davey Johnson planned on stressing
the importance of picking up their recent lackluster play.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said one of the points of interest of the Dodgers'
closed- door meeting was to be a need to manufacture runs and not
rely solely on the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the team's third attempt to push across the winning
run, Jim Leyritz delivered a two-out single to score Adrian Beltre
in the 10th inning and give the Dodgers a 4-3 win at Dodger Stadium
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But before Leyritz's hit, Angels manager Mike Scioscia employed
some unique strategy. Beltre tripled off the right-field wall with
one out in the 10th. Scioscia then moved left fielder Darin Erstad
into the infield, and Kevin Elster grounded out to him. But Leyritz
singled off reliever Al Levine for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had chances to end the game before it reached extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca, recalled from the minors earlier in
the day, began the bottom of the ninth with a double to right
against reliever Mark Petkovsek, only to be stranded. Gary
Sheffield hit a one-hop linerto second, but LoDuca couldn't
advance. Shawn Green was intentionally walked and Eric Karros hit
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially wonderful outing by Dodgers left-hander Carlos
Perez changed quickly to just solid in the seventh. Garret Anderson
led off the seventh with a single to right field, and Troy Glaus
hit Perez's next pitch over the left-field fence to give the Angels
a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing the Dodgers offense did was make Angels
starter Ken Hill work through six innings. Hill struck out eight,
and allowed just four hits, but he threw 123 pitches and was
replaced by Shigetoshi Hasegawa, who promptly got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca's one-out hard grounder got through Mo Vaughn at first to
begin a seventh-inning rally. Sheffield, who hit his 28th homer
earlier, walked but the slumping Green came through. After striking
out in his first three at-bats, Green singled to center to score
LoDuca and tie it at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   One of the points Johnson wanted to make in the meeting was to
accomplish the little things within a game, and the Dodgers had a
chance to do that with Sheffield on third with one out. Karros
walked to load the bases, but needing a deep fly ball to give the
Dodgers the lead, Todd Hollandsworth struck out and Beltre grounded
out to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before batting practice, Johnson spoke to Dodger all-stars Kevin
Brown and Gary Sheffield. He addressed the team as a whole after
batting practice in a closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to talk about where we're at, that we have to tighten the
belts and go get 'em,'' Johnson said. ``This is it. We have to make
it happen.Don't look over their shoulders for some help because
each of us has to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it has to do with executing in the finer points of game,
namely manufacturing runs and sacrificing at-bats for the
betterment of the team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers were a season-high eight games over .500
(25-17) six weeks into the season, they were getting strong
starting pitching, but they also were doing the little things to
score runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little things,'' Sheffield said. ``We got those
things earlyin the year. But the thing is, when things are going
good, it's easy todo those things, but in a 1-0 ballgame, to do
those things, that's when you know that your effort is like (a
championship team), to win a ballgame. Those are the things we have
to concentrate on doing in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone continues to work the
phones in hopes of making a trade that could bolster the starting
rotation, but many of the players believe the current roster of
players is talented enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pieces are here,'' Karros said. ``Ideally, you would
like to get an all-star at every position and have five all-stars
on the (mound), but the reality is for us, our best pieces are
here. You're not going to go out and make changes and get that much
better. That's in reality. If you're playing rotisserie baseball,
you can go out and get whomever you want.''

COACHING CAROUSEL SPINS WILDLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Check the calendar. Yep, it's July. Asphalt's melting,
thermometers are bubbling and the Rangers are looking for enough
arms to have a group hug.
</P>
<P>
   So what in the name of Naismith is going on with college
basketball? Summer isn't the time for coaching changes. But in the
last six weeks, the carousel has been spinning as fast as it
usually does in March. Illinois, Miami (Fla.), Tulsa, North
Carolina, Notre Dame and Tulane have all had to dust off their Help
Wanted signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very unusual off-season. And very difficult,'' Kansas
athletic director Bob Frederick said. And Frederick was lucky. For
about a week, he was ``tied up in knots'' as he waited to see if
Jayhawks coach Roy Williams would accept North Carolina's offer.
When Williams decided to stay in Lawrence, he made his boss very
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dreading calling up athletic directors to ask permission
to talk to their coaches,'' said Frederick, who in June 1988 had to
do just that as he searched for a replacement for Larry Brown.
``Even though I knew they would understand, it's still something
that's very tough to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic directors at this time of year are catching their
breath as one school year ends and another looms. Going over
end-of-the-year budgets is about the most demanding part of the
job. Usually when ADs have to hire a coach, they're ready for it
because they anticipate a coach's firing or departure. This
off-season has provided a series of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA contributed to this wacky off-season. The Atlanta Hawks
hired Lon Kruger away from Illinois, and the Washington Wizards
hired Leonard Hamilton away from Miami (Fla.). North Carolina's
Bill Guthridge stirred the pot even more when he stepped down June
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little taken aback when the North Carolina situation
came up,'' Illinois athletic director Ron Guenther said. ``That's
late for a resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther hired Tulsa's Bill Self to replace Kruger, while Tulsa
turned to Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson. North Carolina created
an opening at Notre Dame when it hired Matt Doherty as Guthridge's
replacement. The dominoes have been falling like new series on UPN.
</P>
<P>
   When basketball coaches start their on-campus player camps in
June, their mind-set starts to move toward the upcoming season. And
by July, when the summer recruiting//evaluation period starts,
coaches believe that the next season has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time, the thoughts about change are over in their
minds,'' Frederick said. ``The time for hiring basketball coaches
is March 15 to June 1 with almost all of the hires done by April
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 10 times more difficult to try to hire a coach at this
time of year. It's a nightmare. I really feel badly for all these
people who are going through it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frederick is plenty happy he's not one of them.
\Nsubheds:Briefly The Sanford Independence Bowl, which has deals
with the Big 12 and Southeastern conferences, has not had a good
month. First, the Louisiana Legislature decided to stop providing
funds for the Sugar and Independence bowls. That cost the
Independence, based in Shreveport, about $250,000. And, the Dec. 31
game will be short on ticket sales because construction at
Independence Stadium has eliminated about 6,000 seats. Seating
capacity will now be around 44,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to one computer service, college football's 2000
season will end with Armageddon. The Cosgrove Computer Rankings
(no, it's not part of the Bowl Championship Series formula) are
projecting eight teams will be undefeated in the regular season _
TCU, Texas, Kansas State, Florida State, Wisconsin, Alabama,
Georgia and Utah. However, that list of undefeateds would be pared
to six because of the league championship games in the Big 12 and
Southeastern conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and Wisconsin are close to finalizing a deal to play in
the 2001 Black Coaches Association Classic. The game would be
played in Madison, Wis. Next year will be the final season for the
preseason ``classic'' games.

WEST TO STEP DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK   and DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry West, the heart and soul of the Los Angeles
Lakers franchise and its driving force as a player, coach and
executive over the last four decades, has decided to retire,
effective today, numerous sources told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to what I understand, (today) is his last day, and
then he's going fishing,'' a source close to West said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That vacation, team sources indicated, will be permanent. It
comes just 25 days after the Lakers won the NBA championship, the
seventh in the franchise's Los Angeles era, all with West as a
member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Bel Air home Thursday evening, West refused to
comment other than to say, ``I might go into the Laker office for a
few hours Friday morning for the final time. On Saturday, I'm
flying to Alaska for five days with my family to do a little
fishing. That's all I want to say for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have not called a news conference, however, and are
declining comment on the story, which began with a FoxSports.com
report early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not resigned yet,'' cautioned one member of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   West's departure might come as somewhat of a surprising move to
some observers since he still has three years left on a Lakers
contract that pays him $4 million annually, but those close to West
long have expected it.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement might not come for weeks. The Lakers are
currently negotiating with free agents but cannot sign players
until Aug. 1; West's retirement, observers say, might scare off
potential signees.
</P>
<P>
   West has persistently waved off rumors that he would resign as
the head of the Lakers' basketball operations
</P>
<P>
   a post he's held since 1982, first as general manager and more
recently as executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously stressed-out West has flirted with retirement
for the last several years, adding a dose of uncertainty to any
reports that he plans to quit. But many who know the 62-year-old
Hall of Famer say West has made up his mind. Two NBA general
managers confirmed that West considers this decision final.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns, as well as the usual stresses of the job,
apparently prompted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's sick, mentally and physically, because of what
this business does,'' said one person close to West.
</P>
<P>
   Although those around West are accustomed to his intense persona
and his rollercoaster of emotions, the feeling is that he has
reached a breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like he's gotten more and more emotional,'' the
same source said. ``It's gone further and further each time.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, team insiders believe West will not accept any
consultant-type role to stay with the Lakers, but rather will make
a complete break from the franchise. Working part-time, observers
say, would be impossible for West.
</P>
<P>
   There have been subtle but growing indications that West can no
longer endure the strain of an up-and-down NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept an increasingly low profile during the season and
chose not to attend most of the Lakers' playoff games, including
the entire championship series against the Indiana Pacers. Even
after the Lakers won the title, ending a 12-year drought, West said
the success had not eased his personal pain.
</P>
<P>
   A day after they clinched the championship, when asked if it was
a gratifying conclusion to the work he did constructing the team,
West said ``Not for me. . . . This time of year is very difficult,
more difficult than I ever thought.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sounded an ominous tone regarding his future with the
team. Asked if he was still driven, West said, ``I don't know that.
I don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet West will certainly be remembered for the drive that spurred
the Lakers to seven championships since 1972. He helped win the
first one as a prolific shooting guard dubbed ``Mr. Clutch'' for
his timely scoring.
</P>
<P>
   West was a consultant when the Lakers won titles in 1980 and '82
and was general manager of the ``Showtime'' teams that won
championships in 1985, '87 and '88.
</P>
<P>
   And his imprint is all over the 2000 squad, which returned the
Lakers to preeminence after several rough transition years that
followed the retirement of Magic Johnson and the end of the
``Showtime'' era.
</P>
<P>
   West cleared the roster and salary cap room to sign center
Shaquille O'Neal in the summer of 1996, and at the same time
acquired high-school star Kobe Bryant. Four years later, O'Neal and
Bryant form the best tandem in the league, and their talents
carried the Lakers to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   West also engineered the trades that brought key role players
such as Glen Rice and Robert Horry to the team.
</P>
<P>
   But new constraints on NBA executives' ability to make such
deals are also playing a role in West's frustration. The NBA's
salary cap has become increasingly stringent and complex, and the
league is bracing for a new so-called luxury tax that will penalize
teams that greatly exceed the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lakers owner Jerry Buss has given strict orders to
contain and even reduce salaries, making it extremely difficult to
continually upgrade the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people close to West find it difficult to believe he will
walk away. Knowing his mood swings, and his passion for the job,
they say it won't be surprising at all if he decides to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's just talk, like he does every year,'' one Lakers
source said. ``But the circumstances (of the Lakers winning the
championship) make it more believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka, who has known West
since his playing days, saw the opposite situation: that West will
stay because they won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised (if he retired). It would be hard for me
to assume that he would walk away at this stage of his career,
especially with the kind of job that he has done,'' Bertka said.
``But I don't know. I'm not inside Jerry's head. . . . Only he
knows what his reasoning is.'' &QL;

M'S SUFFER POWER SHORTAGE WITHOUT THEIR BIG BATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ After Edgar Martinez singled with two out in the
10th inning Thursday, Mariners manager Lou Piniella looked to his
bench for a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Martinez, the slowest Mariner, remained
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, also, that the Mariners didn't score and
wound up losing in the bottom of the inning. A two-out, bad-hop
grounder off shortstop Carlos Guillen gave the San Diego Padres a
2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's bench options, already limited, took a beating when
Rickey Henderson was hit on the left elbow in the third inning.
When you add the loss of the team's leadoff hitter to other
problems _ the right knee injury that has shortstop Alex Rodriguez
out and the absence of Martinez in the designated hitter-less
hinterlands of the National League _ it's clear that Seattle's
margin for error early in this second half of the season is
perilously small.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will make at least one move Friday, activating
catcher Dan Wilson from the disabled list, but they don't know if
Henderson will be able to play. They do know that Rodriguez won't
play for at least a few more days and that the NL isn't going to
implement the DH overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are going to have to suck it up. The first-place
team in the AL West will get no sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares about this,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said
in a matter-of-fact way. ``No one will take it easy on us because
of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a mulligan in baseball. You've got to go out and
play. So we have more people out. So what? As long as you have nine
guys, you have to go out and play and not feel sorry for
yourselves. And we've got nine guys who can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't Thursday. The Mariners got a craftsman-like start
from Freddy Garcia and reasonable relief work from the bullpen.
Garcia allowed just one run, which normally is enough to win. But
the Mariners' offense, without the punch that either Rodriguez or
Martinez would have provided, scored just one unearned run in 10
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle put multiple men on base just once, when Guillen singled
and Henderson was hit in the third inning. McLemore's subsequent
grounder was kicked by shortstop Kevin Nicholson, scoring Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   End of offense, such as it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres weren't much better, but San Diego scratched out a
run in the seventh inning, ultimately forcing extra innings. Then
Mariners reliever Brett Tomko made two crucial mistakes in the
10th. With two out, he walked Phil Nevin. Then he walked Bret
Boone, pushing Nevin to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dealt myself that hand,'' Tomko said. ``It was my fault they
had the winning run at second base. All I could do then was get a
ground ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. But the grounder, off Wiki Gonzalez's bat, found a bit
of uneven turf. The ball jumped to about three times its expected
height, and Guillen wasn't able to keep it in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad hop I tried to keep in front of me,'' Guillen
said. ``As soon as it was by me, I knew we'd lost. I feel bad about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad feelings won't dissipate anytime soon if the offense
can't carry its share of the weight. Right now, it can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to play short again tomorrow,'' said assistant
general manager Lee Pelekoudas, suggesting no immediate help from
the minor league system can be expected. Given their current lack
of offensive weapons, the Mariners can expect more of this
low-scoring output in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mariners are going to struggle to be competitive,
something they didn't have to do in the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   True, Seattle could put Martinez in the lineup at first base any
time. But to do that, first baseman John Olerud either has to go to
the outfield _ where he hasn't played since 1990 _ or the bench.
Given the defensive differential, it's not a move Piniella is eager
to make.
</P>
<P>
   The manager seems stumped for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I may try to do is put in all my switch-hitters,''
Piniella said. ``That way I won't have to make any moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was kidding _ sort of. He only has three switch-hitters
_ Guillen, McLemore and Stan Javier.
</P>
<P>
   What Piniella does have is a three-game lead in the AL West. He
also has the best pitching in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to maximize the latter to protect the former.

WEST TO STEP DOWN

 CORRECTIONS THROUGHOUT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK   and DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry West, the heart and soul of the Los Angeles
Lakers franchise and its driving force as a player, coach and
executive over the last four decades, has decided to retire,
effective today, numerous sources told the Los Angeles Daily News
and Long Beach Press-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to what I understand, (today) is his last day, and
then he's going fishing,'' a source close to West said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That vacation, team sources indicated, will be permanent. It
comes just 25 days after the Lakers won the NBA championship, the
seventh in the franchise's Los Angeles era, all with West as a
member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Bel Air home Thursday evening, West refused to
comment other than to say, ``I might go into the Laker office for a
few hours Friday morning for the final time. On Saturday, I'm
flying to Alaska for five days with my family to do a little
fishing. That's all I want to say for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have not called a news conference, however, and are
declining comment on the story, which began with a FoxSports.com
report early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not resigned yet,'' cautioned one member of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   West's departure might come as somewhat of a surprising move to
some observers since he still has three years left on a Lakers
contract that pays him $4 million annually, but those close to West
long have expected it.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement might not come for weeks. The Lakers are
currently negotiating with free agents but cannot sign players
until Aug. 1; West's retirement, observers say, might scare off
potential signees.
</P>
<P>
   West has persistently waved off rumors that he would resign as
the head of the Lakers' basketball operations _ a post he's held
since 1982, first as general manager and more recently as executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously stressed-out West has flirted with retirement
for the last several years, adding a dose of uncertainty to any
reports that he plans to quit. But many who know the 62-year-old
Hall of Famer say West has made up his mind. Two NBA general
managers confirmed that West considers this decision final.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns, as well as the usual stresses of the job,
apparently prompted the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's sick, mentally and physically, because of what
this business does,'' said one person close to West.
</P>
<P>
   Although those around West are accustomed to his intense persona
and his roller-coaster of emotions, the feeling is that he has
reached a breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like he's gotten more and more emotional,'' the
same source said. ``It's gone further and further each time.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, team insiders believe West will not accept any
consultant-type role to stay with the Lakers but rather will make a
complete break from the franchise. Working part-time, observers
say, would be impossible for West.
</P>
<P>
   There have been subtle but growing indications that West can no
longer endure the strain of an up-and-down NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept an increasingly low profile during the season and
chose not to attend most of the Lakers' playoff games, including
the entire championship series against the Indiana Pacers. Even
after the Lakers won the title, ending a 12-year drought, West said

WITH 2004 AS GOAL, FORT WORTH GIRL DEVOTES LIFE TO JUDO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAWN REISS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Brigette Kubes turned down a potential track
scholarship at TCU to compete in judo. Her father tried to convince
her to stick with track, even offering to buy her a new car.
</P>
<P>
   She still wouldn't quit judo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kubes quit track. Gone were the workouts with TCU's
track coach. Forgotten was the strong performance in the 800 meters
during her sophomore year at Southwest High School.
</P>
<P>
   Her life became judo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't go to the Olympics in track, and there was a
much better chance of me going in judo,'' Kubes said. ``It was so
hard to do both and stay competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the 17-year-old Southwest graduate is the
third-ranked female judo athlete in the United States. She holds a
first-degree black belt and is ranked No. 1 at 70 kilos (154
pounds) in the 17- to 20-year-old junior division. She has even
trained in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of life because it's all I do,'' Kubes said. ``My
friends get tired because I can never go out, but I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her passion for judo has inspired an Olympic dream. Kubes
believes she can secure one of seven spots on the U.S. women's team
for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Kubes, who is 5-foot-10, trains six
days a week, running, lifting and practicing judo. She hasn't
consumed a soft drink in six years. In high school, she gave up
attending football games and dating to concentrate on judo and
maintaining an A average in school.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Kubes is scheduled to compete at the U.S. Judo
Association Nationals in Charlotte, N.C. After that, she and her
13-year-old sister, Nikki, head to the 15-country Maruchan Miami
Youth International competition, scheduled for July 22-23. Nikki, a
brown belt, has won junior nationals in her age category five
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nikki has a lot of talent, and she can do things right away,
but it took Brigette longer to understand,'' said Koichiro
Toninura, a Japanese judo warrior and Dallas businessman who trains
with Kubes. ``She's gotten a lot better. It's very deceiving, just
by looking at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigette Kubes was not a model athlete when she started judo.
Kubes' father remembers that she could not do a push-up or climb a
rope, but gradually she grew stronger physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Kubes hoped to win the high school nationals for judo.
She placed second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so upset after the fight,'' Kubes said. ``The girl who
beat me is not near my level, but the next time we fight I'll get
her.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, at the Judo Senior Nationals in Houston, she
fought back after losing in the first round. She won a bronze
medal, beating Kristi Springer, an alternate for the 1996 U.S.
Olympic Team and the top-ranked U.S. female judo athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard to fight your way back,'' Kubes said. ``I had
never won against her before. ... It boosted my confidence for all
of my tournaments coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   By placing third at the Senior Nationals, Kubes qualified for
the Gothenburg Youth International tournament in Sweden. Kubes
again placed third, almost assuring that she can compete in the
Junior Worlds this October in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   She also plans to compete in Hungary and Poland next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people respect you, they fight scared, and then it's
harder to fight a person,'' said Tommy Dyer, Kubes' coach. ``Now
she has earned that respect from her opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring a major injury, I feel confident that she will be in
the Olympics. She's just that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubes' hard work attracted the attention of San Jose State,
which offered her a judo scholarship. The U.S. Olympic Training
Center also offered her residency in Colorado Springs, Colo. She
turned down both to continue training with Dyer at the nonprofit
Fort Worth Judo Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten me where I'm now, so why change that?'' Kubes
said. ``I also like home, and I want to help my sister come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters became interested in judo after their father, a
Tarrant County constable, wanted his daughters to learn
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in law enforcement, I see the victims, I see the
statistics,'' Joe Kubes said. ``I knew 99 percent of fights are won
on the ground. I wanted them to be able to defend themselves in the
back seat of a car. My girls are not going to be overpowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the girls can throw boys in the ring, but there's a new
concern. Dyer and the Kubes family hope Nikki will be bigger than
Brigette so they won't have to fight each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics? They are both going to make it,'' their father
said. ``The only problem is getting them in two different weight
classes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brigette returns from Europe, she plans to attend Tarrant
County College then transfer to TCU. And she's driving a lime-green
Volkswagen New Beetle, purchased by her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl has been so good,'' Joe Kubes said. ``She has given
up so much to do this. My wife and I just told her, `This is a
reward, for good things happen to good people.' '' nn

ONLY THE ATHLETES CAN RESCUE SHAMED OLYMPIC MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Woke up Thursday, opened my sports section and read a
nice story about Olympic discus thrower Aretha Hill _ a story that
made it impossible not to pose an urgent question:
</P>
<P>
   Can the athletes save the Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   It might be up to them.
</P>
<P>
   In this most cynical, big-business, everyone-can-be-bought world
of sports, this is no easy task. Athletes like Hill provide the
greatest hope for the strained, shamed Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, in the current climate, there's room for skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a former Australian discus thrower published a book
called ``Positive,'' claiming that swimmers and track athletes were
using illegal human growth hormones undetectable in conventional
testing methods.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest installment in a thorough indictment of the
state of chemically enhanced performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, the hunt will be on for drug cheats, or so we are
told by International Olympic Committee officials sensing that
records and gold medals will be meaningless under a shroud of
suspicion about steroids and blood doping.
</P>
<P>
   The ring of skepticism will tighten closer around the athletes
upon whom this entire Olympic movement is built.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth to the notion that skepticism and cynicism are in
vogue, but no one wants the Olympics to die.
</P>
<P>
   An athlete like Hill makes you hold out faint hope that somehow
the IOC and all other layers of federations and governing bodies
will get their houses in order.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a former University of Washington star, is training for
the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials, which begin Friday in
Sacramento, Calif., and run through July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 4 in the country in the discus, Hill was an Olympian
in 1996. She was quoted regarding her desire to compete again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing to describe,'' Hill told the
Post-Intelligencer's Ted Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you walk in, 100,000 fans stand at their feet and
start yelling and screaming `USA! USA!' For the first time in my
life, I realized what it's like to be an American and represent
your country.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know the Olympics are rife with jingoism. The hype is
inordinate. But Hill, who has mortgaged her future to pay for
training, is banking that some part of the Olympic ``ideal'' still
holds true.
</P>
<P>
   She felt it. She wants to feel it again. She isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who grew up glued to the television, witnessing the
wingspan of Mark Spitz or the joy of Olga Korbut, wants to feel it
again, too. So does Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest athletes of all time, Joyner-Kersee
announced Thursday that she will compete in the U.S. Track Trials.
The queen of the heptathlon and long jump will seek to qualify for
the U.S. Olympic team in the latter event.
</P>
<P>
   Does the Olympic movement deserve Joyner-Kersee, whose comeback
from retirement will make for compelling action in the sand pits
this weekend in Sacramento?
</P>
<P>
   The scandal and corruption is widespread enough to warrant the
proposition that the Olympic movement is tarnished beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Hill earnestly working toward her dream, even with
Joyner-Kersee back on track, can we forget about Juan Antonio
Samaranch?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, after the IOC president's theater-of-the-absurd
appearance before a U.S. Senate panel last year investigating
high-stakes Olympic shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Can we forget about the IOC members who received trips, health
care, gifts and jobs for relatives, leading to the ouster of 10 of
the shadiest freeloaders?
</P>
<P>
   Can we forget that Olympic organizing officials in Salt Lake
City and Australia bribed IOC members with less shame than Beltway
lobbyists?
</P>
<P>
   Can we forget that all of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's
top officials had to be replaced as federal prosecutors uncovered
the widespread scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Down Under, IOC leader Michael Payne is warning Australian
leaders against ``ambush advertising.'' The message: Nothing like
that can happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In downtown Atlanta during the summer of '96, the Olympics
were turned into a riot of commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta prostituted itself for the almighty dollar, with a
barrage of billboards, ticky-tack kiosks and chintzy shops that
overwhelmed almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's only saving grace was the flashes of brilliance from
Michael Johnson, Fatuma Roba's marathon victory and the triumph of
the gender-equity Olympics, thanks to the U.S. women's soccer,
basketball and softball teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic season is upon us once again. This time, with the
Sydney Games taking place so many time zones away, under a cloud of
shame and skepticism, it is time to wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Can the Olympics be saved?

 subheds:JUDO: A PRIMER 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judo, which means ``the gentle way,'' was founded in 1882 in
Japan by Dr. Jigoro Kano, president of the School of Education,
Tokyo. Kano wanted to become physically and mentally fit through
discipline training. Judo for men became an Olympic sport in 1964,
was dropped in 1968, then returned in 1972 and has remained in the
Games since. Judo for women became an Olympic sport in 1992.
 &LR; subheds:Scoring In judo, points are awarded as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Ippon (full point): Throwing an opponent on his or her back with
force; or maintaining a pin for 25 seconds; or having an opponent
quit; or earning two waza-ari
</P>
<P>
   Waza-ari (1/2 point): A throw is almost successful, but is
either not with enough force or the opponent lands only partially
on the back; or maintaining a pin for 20 seconds
</P>
<P>
   Yuko (almost waza-ari): A throw is partially successful but is
sloppy with some part of the butt touching; or maintaining a pin
for 15 seconds
</P>
<P>
   Koka (almost yuko): A throw with some force but not on the back;
or maintaining a pin for 10 seconds
</P>
<P>
   Matches last four minutes, and the objective is to score one
point. Yukos and kokas are considered only if times runs out
without either contestant scoring a point. Then the victory is
awarded based on the next-highest score. For example, a waza-ari
beats any combination of yukos and kokas. If contestants are tied
in waza-ari, the leader in yukos wins, regardless of kokas. If
waza-aris and yukos are tied, the koka leader wins. If all scores
are tied, the match is decided by ``going to flags,'' and the three
referees vote, signalling their votes with flags.  &LR; name:_ Dawn

WEST HAS HAD ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 ... ADDS DETAILS, QUOTES (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK and DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry West, the heart and soul of the Los Angeles
Lakers franchise and its driving force as a player, coach and
executive over the last four decades, has decided to retire,
effective today, numerous sources told the Long Beach
Press-Telegram and Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to what I understand, (today) is his last day, and
then he's going fishing,'' a source close to West said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That vacation, team sources indicated, will be permanent. It
comes just 25 days after the Lakers won the NBA championship, the
seventh in the franchise's Los Angeles era, all with West as a
member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Bel Air home Thursday evening, West refused to
comment other than to say, ``I might go into the Laker office for a
few hours Friday morning for the final time. On Saturday, I'm
flying to Alaska for five days with my family to do a little
fishing. That's all I want to say for now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have not called a news conference, however, and are
declining comment on the story, which began with a FoxSports.com
report early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not resigned yet,'' cautioned one member of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   West's departure might come as somewhat of a surprise to some
observers since he has three years left on a Lakers contract that
pays him $4 million annually, but those close to West long have
expected it. West in recent days has been negotiating a severance
package with Lakers attorneys, an indication that he planned to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement might not come for weeks. The Lakers are
negotiating with free agents but cannot sign players until Aug. 1;
West's retirement, observers say, might scare off potential
signees.
</P>
<P>
   West has persistently waved off rumors that he would resign as
the head of the Lakers' basketball operations _ a post he's held
since 1982, first as general manager and more recently as executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously stressed-out West has flirted with retirement
for the last several years, adding a dose of uncertainty to any
reports that he plans to quit. But many who know the 62-year-old
Hall of Famer say West has made up his mind. Two NBA general
managers confirmed that West considers this decision final.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns, as well as the usual stresses of the job,
apparently prompted the decision. Apparently, West has had an
irregular heartbeat that doctors told him was caused by nervous
tension.
</P>
<P>
   He did not attend most of the playoffs and missed the NBA
title-clinching Game 6 triumph over the Indiana Pacers _ he was
driving around in his car while it was being played and a friend
informed him on the cell phone of its outcome. West was set to have
a defibrillation procedure on his heart at St. Joseph's Hospital in
Burbank a few days afterward. However, his heartbeat returned to
normal and the procedure was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's sick, mentally and physically, because of what
this business does,'' said one person close to West.
</P>
<P>
   Although those around West are accustomed to his intense persona
and his roller-coaster of emotions, the feeling is that he has
reached a breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like he's gotten more and more emotional,'' the
same source said. ``It's gone further and further each time.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, team insiders believe West will not accept any
consultant-type role to stay with the Lakers but rather will make a
complete break from the franchise. Working part-time, observers
say, would be impossible for West.
</P>
<P>
   There have been subtle but growing indications that West can no
longer endure the strain of an up-and-down NBA season _ he kept an
increasingly low profile during the season and did not attend most
of the Lakers playoff games. Even after the Lakers won the title,
ending a 12-year drought, West said the success had not eased his
personal pain.
</P>
<P>
   A day after they clinched the championship, when asked if it was
a gratifying conclusion to the work he did constructing the team,
West said ``Not for me. . . . This time of year is very difficult,
more difficult than I ever thought.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sounded an ominous tone regarding his future with the
team. Asked if he was still driven, West said, ``I don't know that.
I don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet West will certainly be remembered for the drive that spurred
the Lakers to seven championships since 1972. He helped win the
first one as a prolific shooting guard dubbed ``Mr. Clutch'' for
his timely scoring.
</P>
<P>
   West was a consultant when the Lakers won titles in 1980 and '82
and was general manager of the ``Showtime'' teams that won
championships in 1985, '87 and '88.
</P>
<P>
   And his imprint is all over the 2000 squad, which returned the
Lakers to preeminence after several rough transition years that
followed the retirement of Magic Johnson and the end of the
``Showtime'' era.
</P>
<P>
   West cleared the roster and salary-cap room to sign center
Shaquille O'Neal in the summer of 1996, and at the same time
acquired high school star Kobe Bryant. Four years later, O'Neal and
Bryant form the best tandem in the league, and their talents
carried the Lakers to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   West also engineered the trades that brought key role players
such as Glen Rice and Robert Horry to the team.
</P>
<P>
   But new constraints on NBA executives' ability to make such
deals are also playing a role in West's frustration. The NBA's
salary cap has become increasingly stringent and complex, and the
league is bracing for a new so-called luxury tax that will penalize
teams that greatly exceed the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lakers owner Jerry Buss has given strict orders to
contain and even reduce salaries, making it extremely difficult to
continually upgrade the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people close to West find it difficult to believe he will
walk away. Knowing his mood swings and his passion for the job,
they say it won't be surprising at all if he decides to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's just talk, like he does every year,'' one Lakers
source said. ``But the circumstances (of the Lakers winning the
championship) make it more believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka, who has known West
since his playing days, saw the opposite situation: that West will
stay because they won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised (if he retired). It would be hard for me
to assume that he would walk away at this stage of his career,
especially with the kind of job that he has done,'' Bertka said.
``But I don't know. I'm not inside Jerry's head. . . . Only he
knows what his reasoning is.''

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTH LEBANON _ Was this what victory was for? Was
this why the Hezbollah fighters lost their hundreds of ``martyrs''
in their 18-year conflict with Israel and its Lebanese militia
allies? To blow up a war memorial? It stood atop a hill within
sight of Israel, the foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to
defend. Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for
their country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men. But
most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into joining the
militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would have been
imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in Lebanon....By

promised to be here at 11:30,'' the old woman wheezed. ``We have
been here since 10:30. And now the Israelis told us to go away.''
Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. On the very
day that Sheikha _ separated from her sister 52 years ago when the
Jewish Army attacked their village _ called from Israel to confirm
their meeting at the wire, the Israelis decided to call an end to
the family reunions over the frontier fence....By Robert Fisk, The

allies? To blow up a war memorial? It stood atop a hill within
sight of Israel, the foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to
defend. Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for
their country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men. But
most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into joining the
militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would have been
imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in Lebanon....By

DODGERS WIN IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels are
roughly in the same spot. Five games behind in their respective
divisions. But they are also worlds apart and it has a lot to do
with a $34 million difference in payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels kicked off the second half of the season with a
loosey-goosey approach to the three-game I-5 series. The Dodgers
decided to have a closed-door team meeting before the game to
stress the importance of playing with enthusiasm and focus for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Dodgers, after wasting a couple of late
chances, badly needed Jim Leyritz's two-out RBI single in the 10th
inning that propelled them to a 4-3 win Thursday night at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It came after the Dodgers had the bases loaded and one out in
the seventh and failed to get the go-ahead run in from third, and
after they wasted a leadoff double by Paul LoDuca in the ninth when
Gary Sheffield grounded out, Shawn Green was intentionally walked
and Eric Karros grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it now is there is still a lot of games, but
there ain't enough games and we're going to start running out of
time if we don't start going now,'' said Dodgers right-hander Mike
Fetters, one of three Dodgers relievers to pitch a perfect inning
of relief. ``It's very important we go right now. The intensity was
a lot better tonight than it was in a while around here. It was big
for us to start off like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And even in the 10th, the Dodgers won it the hard way after
failing in the easier manner. Adrian Beltre tripled with one out
off Al Levine (1-1), but Angels manager Mike Scioscia brought left
fielder Darin Erstad in to make it a five-man infield.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster proceeded to ground out to Erstad, stationed on the
shortstop side near second base. ``We've done that a little too
often for my liking because you use it in dire situations,''
Scioscia said. ``This is one of the games out of the whole marathon
we've been talking about. It's a tough loss, but we have been good
at turning the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz bailed out the Dodgers with a single to right-center
field for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of going up there, and you're supposed to
fail, you're not supposed to succeed, so you go up with that
mindset and it takes the pressure off,'' Leyritz said. ``That kind
of game, if we lose that game, it's a big disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the points manager Davey Johnson wanted to make in the
team meeting was that little things need to be accomplished. Before
batting practice, Johnson spoke to Dodger All-Stars Kevin Brown and
Gary Sheffield. He addressed the team as a whole after batting
practice in a closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to talk about where we're at, that we have to tighten the
belts and go get 'em,'' Johnson said. ``This is it. We have to make
it happen. Don't look over their shoulders for some help because
each of us has to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it has to do with executing in the finer points of game,
namely manufacturing runs and sacrificing at-bats for the
betterment of the team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers were a season-high eight games over .500
(25-17) six weeks into the season, they were getting strong
starting pitching, but they also were doing the little things to
score runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little things,'' Sheffield said. ``We got those
things early in the year. But the thing is, when things are going
good, it's easy to do those things, but in a 1-0 ballgame, to do
those things, that's when you know that your effort is like (a
championship team), to win a ballgame. Those are the things we have
to concentrate on doing in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone continues to work the
phones in hopes of making a trade that could bolster the starting
rotation, but many of the players believe the current roster is
talented enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pieces are here,'' Karros said. ``Ideally, you would
like to get an All-Star at every position and have five All-Stars
on the (mound), but the reality is for us, our best pieces are
here. You're not going to go out and make changes and get that much
better. That's in reality. If you're playing rotisserie baseball,
you can go out and get whomever you want.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a kid growing up in Chicago, I used to do anything I
could to put off going to bed. One of my favorite delaying tactics
was to engage my mother in a discussion about the important
questions of the day, questions my friends and I had debated in the
backyards of our neighborhood that afternoon _ like who did God
root for, the Cubs or the White Sox? (The correct answer was, and
still is, the White Sox.)
</P>
<P>
   Then one night I remember asking my mother something I had been
wondering for a long time. ``Mom,'' I asked, ``What am I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're my darling Donny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. But what else am I?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a precious little boy who someday will grow up to be a
wonderful, handsome man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I mean is, you're white and Dad's black, so what does
that make me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I see,'' she said. ``Well, you're half-black and you're
half-white, so you're the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I told my friends that I was neither black nor
white. ``I'm the best of both worlds,'' I announced proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're crazy,'' one of the backyard boys said. ``You're
not even the best of your family. Your sister is. That girl is
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of my life, I've tried to believe my mother. Having
grown up in a family of blacks and whites, I'd long thought I saw
race more clearly than most people. I appreciated being able to get
close to both worlds, something few ever do. It was like having a
secret knowledge. And yet I've also known from an early age that
things were more complicated than my mother made them out to be.
Our country, from its very beginnings, has been obsessed with
determining who is white and who is black. Our history has been
shaped by that disheartening question. To be both black and white,
then, is to do nothing less than confound national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   My mother denies it, but it has also sometimes confounded our
family. For as my mother was answering my bedtime question, my
brothers, David and Robert, her children from an earlier marriage,
were going to sleep in a house 15 miles away. My father was black.
David and Robert's was white. They lived with my grandmother in an
all-white neighborhood. I lived with my mother and my younger
sister, Diane, in Hyde Park, a mixed neighborhood on the South Side
of Chicago. We shared a loving parent, but we lived in separate
Americas. We have spent most of our lives trying to come together.
</P>
<P>
   My father, Bill Terry, was born in Covington, Ky., in 1921, the
grandson of slaves. In his youth, he was a professional boxer.
Later, he went to work as a bodyguard for the unions in Chicago,
cracking scab heads. He was one black man who was not at all shy
about standing up to authority. In his late 30's, he became an
actor. He was good at it, too. My mother told me years later that
when my father walked onto a stage to deliver his lines in ``The
Death of Bessie Smith,'' the audience gasped. ``He had presence,''
my mother said. ``Incredible presence.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifelong integrationist, but the nonviolent civil
rights movement was not for him. He could not understand how
protesters could allow themselves to be roughed up and spat on at
sit-ins and not defend themselves. Bill Terry didn't turn the other
cheek; he threw the other fist.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, Jeanne Katherine Ober, was born in 1918 and was
reared on a dairy farm outside the village of Greenwood, Ill. She
was sent to high school in Chicago and then, at 25, she returned
home to marry the son of a wealthy farmer. It was a rocky union:
her husband drank too much, and after eight years of marriage, my
mother left, taking her two sons to Chicago _ David was 8, Robert
was 2. There, she opened a nursery school and became involved in
civil rights work through her Unitarian church. Until then, she had
never personally known a black person.
</P>
<P>
   My parents met in 1956, at a party of racially mixed hipsters.
He was 35; she was 38. As my mother tells it, she had been eyeing
my father for much of the evening. He was the center of attention,
with his boxer's grace and a smile that could light up the darkest
corners of the room. Before long, my father asked my mother to
dance. At 6 feet 2 inches, he towered over her. Soon, my parents
were living together _ along with David and Robert _ in my mother's
four-bedroom Colonial in Evanston, a Chicago suburb. Ten months
after they met, I was born.
</P>
<P>
   I was 6 months old when my father decided he wanted to sell the
house and move to California. When my mother's mother heard about
the plan, she had a fit. My grandmother said the boys needed
stability and insisted they live with her and her second husband,
Gerhard Raven. My staying with Grandpa Raven was not an option. On
the day Grandpa Raven found out my mother was carrying a black
man's baby, he got uncharacteristically drunk. My grandmother told
him about the pregnancy at a restaurant because she felt that
perhaps if she explained it in a public place, he might not
explode. When they got home, Gerhard poured himself a drink and
took it outside to the front porch. He sat on the cement steps
muttering about the ``goddamn niggers.''
</P>
<P>
   When we left for California, the plan was for my parents to send
for my brothers once we got settled. But ``instead of getting
settled,'' my mother said, ``we got poor.'' We quickly ran out of
money. My father lost his landscaping job and stopped looking for
work. Less than a year after arriving in L.A., he hopped into our
car and disappeared without saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was desperate. She used her last few dollars to buy a
plane ticket to get the two of us back to Chicago, where she knew
my father was headed. We arrived around Christmas with nowhere to
go. My grandmother made it clear that we were not welcome at her
house. We spent the holiday sleeping in the home of a black friend
of my mother's. ``I was disowned,'' my mother said recently, when I
asked her about those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it because of me?'' I asked, sounding to myself like a
little boy again. ``Was it because I was black?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' my mother said. ``No, it had nothing to do with you. My
mother was mad at me for going through the money.''
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised at how relieved I felt. I wasn't sure that I
believed her, though I desperately wanted to. One of the nightmares
of race is that it's sometimes hard to distinguish between
cruelties _ hard to know what is racism and what is the simple
human infliction of pain.
</P>
<P>
   A white friend of my mother's from the civil rights movement
allowed us to move into his roach-infested tenement on the edge of
Hyde Park. A few weeks after we got settled, my father reappeared
and my parents reconciled. We were a family again _ except that my
brothers continued to live with my grandmother and Gerhard.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in 1959, my parents had a daughter, Diane. I
remember how happy I was that we were all together. It was
especially great to have my father around. If I bugged him enough,
he would put down his paper and, like his hero, Paul Robeson, sing
``Ol' Man River'' for me. On hot summer evenings, when it seemed
the whole neighborhood was out, my father would scoop me up in his
arms and run with me through the warm evening air. I was home. My
dad was with me; it was heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Park itself played a major role in my happiness. The
neighborhood, which is home to the University of Chicago, had been
integrated since the late 1940's, despite the early resistance of
the university. By the time I came along, having a black father and
a white mother was common in Hyde Park. In fact, there were so many
biracial children running around the neighborhood when I was a kid
that it was almost hip to be ``mixed,'' as we called ourselves
then. It was so hip that some people who weren't pretended that
they were. Sophia, for example, was white, but she told everyone
that her father, who was from the Soviet Union, was a ``black
Russian'' _ ``You know, like the drink,'' she said. Since she was
only trying to fit in, we forgave her her lies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mixed kids in Hyde Park were pure-blooded mulattos,
so to speak. There were Bob, Michael, Rebecca, Cindy, the Twins and
many others. All of them had black fathers and white mothers. With
so many kids who looked like me and withso many parents who looked
like mine, it was easy to feel completely comfortable saying I was
simply half and half. My memory is one of togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that even in this utopia the power of race was
entirely absent from our lives. When I was a boy, my father would
perform a ritual. He'd plop his long brown arm down on a table top
and ask me if I could see the red tint in his skin. ``See there,''
he'd say. ``That's the Indian blood in me. You have it, too. All
the Terrys do. We're a quarter Cherokee.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd carefully inspect his arm, turning it over in the light, but
all I could ever see was the brown skin of a black man. I thought
it was a strange game. He did not look like an Indian. His skin was
brown. There was nothing red about him.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing red about me either. My complexion is the
color of sand. The texture of my hair is somewhere between kinky
and curly. I have my father's full lips, and my nose and thick
eyebrows come from my mother. When I look in the mirror, it is easy
for me to see Europe and Africa dancing across my face like lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Other people, however, aren't sure what they see. When they ask,
``What's your nationality?'' I often suspect that they really mean:
are you on our side or their side? Can we trust you, brother? Are
you dangerous, nigger? I'm not sure my answer can ever really
change the interaction. These questions, these loyalty oaths, have
followed me most of my life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, our world changed. My parents got into a vicious
argument. My father had been out carousing and my mother was fed up
with him drinking up what little money we had. In a flash, my
father had his big hands wrapped around my mother's throat,
squeezing as hard as he could, banging her head against the wall.
It sounded like a thunderstorm. I was terrified. I had heard my
father yell before, but he had never picked my mother up by her
throat and screamed into her face, ``Bitch!''
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea what to do, so I threw myself at his tree trunk of
a leg and tried to bite him. Whenever I think of that night, my
father transforms, in my child's memory, into one of those scary
talking trees in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' ``Daddy!'' I screamed.
``Please stop hurting Mama. Please, Daddy. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not stop. I bit him again. He banged her head some
more. My cousin Junior, who was a grown man, but not nearly as
grown as my father, somehow persuaded him to stop, and my mother
slumped to the floor, holding her throat and looking almost as
scared as I was.
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes, the police seemed to fill up the apartment
with their rough voices and the sound of their clubs slapping
against their leather gun belts and holsters. They yelled at my
father to turn around and to put his hands behind his back so they
could put the handcuffs on. I was confused. I didn't know what was
happening. After all, the only time I really saw my father with his
hands behind his back was when he brought me candy from the corner
store. He would make me guess which hand held the sweets. Then the
police took him down the stairs, and I remember being scared all
over again. I begged them not to take my father away, but they
never turned back.
</P>
<P>
   After that, my parents separated for good. My father moved to
New York City to pursue his acting career. My mother was left with
two children in a crumbling apartment. Sometimes my mother had to
choose between buying food for us or paying the utility bills.
Once, when the electricity was cut off, my sister and I snaked an
extension cord under our front door and plugged it into a socket in
the building's hall so we could have a lamp to do homework. We went
on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The only salvation was that, bit by bit, we started to see my
grandmother and brothers again. Of course, we could only visit my
grandmother's yellow brick bungalow on the far North Side of
Chicago when Grandpa Raven was at work or out of town on one of his
fishing trips. Grandpa Raven had a bad heart. My grandmother was
afraid that the stress of seeing his stepdaughter and her black
children would kill him. So we made sneak visits.
</P>
<P>
   To me, my brothers seemed rich. There was a push-button
television console in the living room, a new Dodge in the garage
and a freezer stuffed with ice cream bars in the basement. My
grandmother, whom we called Nana, would also sneak my brothers down
to Hyde Park, reminding them, ``Don't tell Grandpa Raven.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Raven died when I was 8. His heart finally gave out. But
I can sleep easy that the sight of a black child in his family was
not what killed him. He died never having laid eyes on me. As far I
was concerned, Grandpa Raven was an unrepentant racist; to my
brothers, however, the man who took them fishing couldn't have been
a better surrogate grandfather. ``He was better than a father,''
David said. ``He was a great guy. He was not a man motivated by
prejudice.'' My brother even had an explanation for the drunken
rantings on the steps that day: ``Rather than blame Mother,'' he
said, ``he blamed 'the niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   In my view, David is just as blinded by his love for Grandpa
Raven as I am by my hate. I tell myself that Gerhard is racist evil
incarnate. In my heart, though, I know there is more to it than
that. The truth is a child's truth: I had wanted Gerhard to be my
grandfather, too. After Gerhard's death, we visited my grandmother
every other weekend, making up for lost years. One night, I stayed
over at Nana's. When it came time for my bath, I hopped into the
tub, pretending to recreate the moon landing, which had just taken
place. I had one foot in when Nana called from the living room,
``Remember, Donny, just because your skin is darker doesn't mean I
can't see the dirt, so scrub hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nana didn't mean to hurt my feelings, but she did. Yet I never
thought of her as prejudiced. She was an elderly white woman,
trying to make her way in a changing world. She never said
``nigger.'' She said ``Negro.'' She tried to treat everyone fairly.
She called me ``darling'' and ``honey bunch.'' She made sure there
were always plenty of big chocolate chips in the pantry. I loved
her dearly and she loved me. Without her, we would have sunk
completely into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Biracial though I was, my first real memory of being called
``nigger'' was the same cruel rite of passage it has been for black
children the country over. I was 7, and I was playing football with
a group of white kids in a suburb 25 long miles from Hyde Park. A
boy, about my age, saw me in a neighbor's yard and started jumping
up and down. He pointed at me excitedly as he chanted: ``Nigger.
Nigger. Nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   I was shocked. I wasn't a nigger. My mother was white. Couldn't
he see her standing there, a few feet away? He had heard me call
her mom at least a half-dozen times: ``Mom, I'm having too much
fun. Mom, please can we stay a little longer so I can play with my
new friends?'' Couldn't he tell I was only half-black? He could
have easily called me whitey, honky or cracker. Why didn't he do
that? I had just as much white blood in me as black. And even if I
was all black, why was he calling me names?
</P>
<P>
   I tried to go after the boy, but my mother pulled me back. Then
she did something that shocked me _ and filled me with joy. From 10
feet away, she threw a plastic cup at the kid, hitting him in the
head and sending him running down the street, calling for his
mother. A few years after the football game, I was walking down the
street with a white friend. A well-dressed member of the Nation of
Islam asked me if I wanted to buy a copy of Muhammad Speaks, the
group's newspaper. ``No thanks,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, brother, help your people out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   'Man, you just want to be with Europeans,'' the Muslim said
bitterly, pointing his paper at my friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is a European,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, I'm sorry for you,'' the Muslim shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Other moments also made it clear that a mixed family seemed
foreign to the eyes of America. In the summer of 1972, when I was
15, my brother David, who collects old Packards, took me to
Nebraska to pick up a 1956 Patrician. I was excited _ it was my
first out-of-town trip with one of my brothers. At the car
owner'shouse, David introduced me to a white man in white shoes. He
leaned against a white picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my little brother, Donny,'' he said. The man and I
shook hands. Then he stared at me. I had a huge Afro; David's
straight brown hair was cut Young Republican short. The man winked
at David. ``You mean you work together?'' he asked. ``No,'' David
said. ``I mean this is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I get what you're saying,'' the man said. ``The Bible says
we are all brothers under the skin. It's good to see people taking
the word of God to heart.'' What a fool, I thought to myself then.
Today I know: as a person of mixed race, it's the norm to have your
closest relationships questioned at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until I went to college, racial difference stood out for me
precisely because it was the exception to the rule. In college, it
became a defining force in my life. It didn't start that way. In
1975, when I discovered Oberlin College, I was confident I had
found a place where I could be my mixed-race self. As a stop on the
underground railroad, Oberlin had a special reputation for
enlightened race relations. It was the school's brochure that sold
me, though. Featured prominently was a picture of two baseball
players conferring on the mound. One player was white with a long
ponytail, the other black with an Afro. It looked like home.
</P>
<P>
   But at the start of freshman year, I was startled to see a very
different picture. When I walked into the dining room, black
students were sitting together at a group of tables in the middle
of the room; white students were eating together at tables along
the windows. At football and basketball games, black fans usually
sat with blacks, whites with whites. The intramural sports teams
were rarely mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, I tried to recreate Hyde Park at Oberlin. I hung
out with a mixed group of friends and my intramural teams always
included white guys and black guys _ and slow guys of every color.
I decided not to join the African Heritage dorm. But even on this
supposedly liberal campus, trying to live integrated was an uphill
battle.
</P>
<P>
   A black student asked me once, ``My man, where's the mail
room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``See that brother over there?'' I said, pointing across the
nearly empty room.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That one,'' I said. ``That blond dude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that's no brother,'' he said. ``That's a white boy.
What's wrong with you?''
</P>
<P>
   What was wrong with me? I wasn't split in two _ the world was.
And yet I was the one expected to adjust. Being away from Hyde Park
was a shock to my racial system. I felt even more out of step with
most white students. For the first time, I was exposed to white
people who had not known black people as friends, neighbors or even
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I was visiting a white girl and her white roommate in
their dorm. The door was open and we were just talking. Another
black student was also there, flirting with the roommate. I was
just about to leave when a white girl walking down the hall passed
the open door and stuck her head in. She looked disgusted. ``What's
this,'' she asked, ``a soul-brother session?'' I was stunned. What
did race have to do with anything? We were just two guys rapping to
two girls and not getting anywhere. The girl I was visiting looked
embarrassed. I wasn't sure if she was embarrassed about her rude
neighbor _ or that her rude neighbor had ``caught'' a couple of
brothers in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, I embraced blackness _ as a shield and a cause. I signed
up for a course on black nationalism. The decision was one of the
most important developments of my life. Black studies saved me. It
gave me a sense of discovery both academically and personally.
Black studies helped me find an identity. As important, it helped
me for the first time to understand my father's anger. The more I
learned the more I began to realize the struggles a black person
born in 1921 had to go through just to survive. Once, after reading
about the brutality of the race riots following the First World
War, I had to walk around the library to cool off. That was my
father's welcome to life. I didn't want to run into any of my white
friends that afternoon. I didn't know what I might say to them.
</P>
<P>
   At last, I felt in touch with my rage that race, even at my
``progressive'' college, mattered so much; that I could not
completely be who I was, Don Terry, an integrated man, with a white
mother and a black father; that I would repeatedly be lumped in a
broad racial category _ black _ and treated like a caricature
instead of the complicated individual I knew myself to be. It was
exhausting and maddening, being constantly judged by people who
thought they knew so much about me solely because of the color of
my skin when in fact they knew nothing at all. I seemed to be the
only one to understand that the Don Terry who went to campus
rallies to protest the school's investments in South Africa could,
at the end of the day, relax to the Rolling Stones. Disgusted by
the world's refusal to see me as mixed and individual, I chose
``blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   My decision, I've come to believe, had as much to do with anger
as anything else. I started using the term ``white boy,'' something
I had never done in my life. It felt liberating at first, like
standing up to a bully. But I felt guilt when I went home to Hyde
Park and spent time with my family and old friends. I was afraid I
was becoming a racist.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, I was driving my mother's tiny Volkswagen. She
was sitting in the passenger seat. One of my best friends, Danny
Gnatz, a white guy with hair down past his shoulders, was in back.
We were talking and laughing when a fat white man, driving a big
American car, suddenly cut in front of me. We nearly collided. I
slammed on the brakes, glared out the window and shouted, ``You
stupid white son of a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I said it, I felt like jumping out of the car and
running away in shame. At first, my mother and Danny pretended that
they had not heard. What was going on with me? What did race have
to do with it? ``I'm sorry, you guys,'' I said. ``That's OK,
Donny,'' my mother said, patting my arm. Danny slapped me on the
back of the head, signaling that everything was all right. But we
drove a long way in silence. The incident in the car caused me to
question my behavior, but not my identity. When I returned to
Oberlin, I enrolled in more black studies courses and became even
more involved in the anti-apartheid movement. I left Oberlin a
thoroughly black man.
</P>
<P>
   After college, I went into journalism, hoping to do good in the
world as my parents had tried to do. My first job was at The
Chicago Defender, a small and struggling but historically
significant black newspaper. I then went on to work for a number of
larger papers in the Midwest before coming to The New York Times in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   In just about every one of these jobs, my reputation was built
as much around my race as my journalism; I was the black man with a
big mouth, ready to get loud at the slightest racial slight _ the
brother with a boulder on his shoulder. An editor at The Chicago
Tribune, where I used to work, called me the most contentious young
reporter he'd ever met. Once, at The Times, as I was finishing a
crime piece, an editor came up to me and asked whether the arrested
man, whom the police had roughed up, had a criminal record. I put
it right back to him: how come you're not asking me if the cop has
a record of brutality complaints? In short, I was the one who could
always be counted on to ask the editors why our stories on welfare
seemed to focus on black people when more whites received public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. And yet even as a ``black man,'' I remained confusing
to the world around me, including the black world. One weekend,
after I had joined The Times, I brought home a girlfriend _ a
talented black woman, a poet and fellow journalist. I took her to
meet my brother David. His young daughter, Julie, was wild that
afternoon, running around the house, jumping on the furniture and
singing ``Heartbreak Hotel'' over and over. Afterward my
girlfriend, rubbing her temples with both hands, told me, ``That
Julie is a white brat.'' I was startled by how much those words
hurt. Why couldn't Julie just be a brat? She was a little kid. I
used to shoot arrows down the hall of our apartment; my brother
Robert loved to run barefoot through the snow. In my family the
kids, black and white, are wild. Not long after that, my girlfriend
and I broke up. Julie may have been a brat, but not a white brat.
</P>
<P>
   I like to joke that my mother had four children, if you don't
count any of the men in her life. David is a successful
stockbroker. Robert is an artist and boat captain. My sister,
Diane, has spent the past 22 years battling schizophrenia. Diane
has a daughter, Wakara, who was reared mostly by my mother and me
and who graduated from Oberlin in May. When she accepted her
diploma, David was there, just as he has been been for every one of
her graduations _ and every one of mine. Still, though we are
adults now in a more enlightened time, race can appear like a
ghost, disrupting the life of our family. A few years ago, I was at
David's house. It was a cold Chicago night, yet inside, with flames
crackling, we felt wonderfully warm. David was mixing drinks.
Julie, then 12, announced to us that she had received an A on her
seventh-grade social studies assignment. ``Would you like to see my
project, Uncle Donny?'' she asked me.
</P>
<P>
   Using old photographs, Julie had laid out 100 years of the
family's history, culminating in the well-kept suburb where she and
her family now lived. She handed me the three-ring notebook. Under
a photograph of my mother on a pony, the caption read, ``This is a
picture of my Grandma Jeanne when she was 12 years old on the
family farm in Greenwood, Illinois.'' A few pages and decades later
the text reported: ``This is a picture of my Uncle Robert in the
'60s. As you can see, he was a hippie.'' There were pictures and
words about almost everyone in the family, including Julie's dog,
Buddy, and her cat, Clipper. There were pictures of everyone,
except for Aunt Diane, Cousin Wakara and Uncle Donny, the black
members of the family.
</P>
<P>
   I could not believe that we had been left out. Then I figured I
must have gone through the pictures too fast. Or maybe, I thought,
putting down my glass, it was the drink. So I went through the book
a second time, searching for our pictures, or at least a few words
about us. ``I'm not in this,'' I said, closing the book and handing
it back to Julie. ``What's up with that?'' There was only awkward
silence. Though I tried to let the incident go, I found myself one
day raising it with David's son, Noah, who had just returned from
the Navy. Noah listened to the story, and then told me one of his
own. He was showing his photo album to a black shipmate. When the
sailor turned to pictures of Wakara and me, Noah said: ``The guy
was happy. He patted me on the back. He said, 'We don't have to
worry about Noah. He's part black.'''
</P>
<P>
   My nephew paused. ``I told him I'm not part black,'' he said.
``It didn't matter to him. He was still happy.'' And so was I.
</P>
<P>
   My brother Robert lives in a small city in Washington State,
largely isolated from the rest of the family. It is clear, too,
that he has isolated himself from memories of our childhood. His
distance _ both geographic and emotional _ is understandable, for
he bears the wounds of an 8-year-old who was left behind by his
mother. When I asked Robert questions about the past, he repeatedly
said he did not remember and that I should ask David. But one
afternoon, as we drove through his town, he slowly began to open
up.
</P>
<P>
   Robert does not think he harbors any ill will toward black
people because of Bill Terry's role in dividing our family. But I'm
not so sure. ``You could say,'' Robert said, ``that a black person
came in and tore up the family.'' He didn't say, ``You could say
another man came in and ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could blame Bill for destroying the family,'' he went on,
negotiating the road's curves. ``But I don't think that has rubbed
off on me as being a racist. I don't think it's affected me in a
negative way. You can see it affecting someone like Grandpa Raven,
though,'' he continued. ``He had a little bit about him that was
kind of Aryan. People build up these barriers and it's hard for
them to climb over them.''
</P>
<P>
   We headed toward the town's waterfront, and the more Robert
talked, the more I worked to hide my anger and my hurt _ and to
remember his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother,'' he said, ``seemed to develop a propensity for black
men.''
</P>
<P>
   I simmered. What did it matter that Mom had black boyfriends?
She lived on the South Side of Chicago and was involved in the
civil rights movement. There were a lot of black men around. If she
had white boyfriends instead, would Robert say that she had
developed a propensity for white men? It began to rain and we
passed a couple of young Latino men standing on a corner. Robert
glanced at them and said his town wasn't the same anymore. More and
more people who looked like gang members seemed to be showing up,
many of them Latino. ``I get upset with the country changing so
much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus, I thought to myself. What the hell does that mean? If
Robert had been any other white man talking about the ``good ol'
days'' and the changing country, if I had been interviewing Robert
as a reporter on assignment, I would have been convinced I'd found
a racist. But even in the midst of my anger, I kept forcing myself
to try to believe that Robert was not a racist. He was my big
brother, a star athlete, the guy I wanted to impress when I was a
kid.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, I was willing to give him the benefit of the
doubt, something I realized I do not often do for most white
people. ``I don't think I'm a racist,'' Robert said, making me
think he had read my mind. ``But maybe I am. I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   If Robert and I were struggling with race _ after all, in heavy
traffic, I occasionally mumble about bad-driving white boys _ his
8-year-old son, Henry, was not. One day, Robert, Henry and I drove
up to Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a wonderful afternoon going to museums and eating fish
and chips. In the evening, we headed home, with Robert driving and
Henry and me sitting in the back. At the border, Robert pulled into
the line of cars waiting to go into the United States. From the
back seat, I could see the American border guard, a young black
man, wave several cars through with hardly a word. When it was our
turn, however, he walked slowly around our car, peering into the
windows. Something was suspicious about us. ``Where are you
going?'' he asked Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going home,'' Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that in the back seat?'' the guard asked, pointing at
me. ``That's my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Robert said. ``We're half brothers.'' I cringed at the
word ``half.'' The guard looked at me again. He was on the verge of
asking another question, when Henry leaned across my lap and,
poking his head out the window, said, ``He's my Uncle Donny and we
love him.'' The young American still looked suspicious, but he
stepped aside and waved us on our way home. Perhaps, I thought,
that's the best we can hope to do _ to insist upon our allegiance
to one another, our brotherhood across the divide _ and try to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   And my parents? My mother went back to college when she was in
her 40s and has been a schoolteacher ever since. At 82, she teaches
history and conflict resolution at an alternative school, Sullivan
House, on the South Side of Chicago. Not long ago, I tried to ask
her why she didn't bring David and Robert with us to California. It
was a gentle summer day and we were in a small Catholic cemetery
near her hometown. My mother sat in the grass next to her mother's
grave. She was hugging her knees to her chest. Her back was turned
to me. She was crying.
</P>
<P>
   We had been to the cemetery many times over the years, but I
could not remember my mother crying before. The tears were my
fault. I was asking her questions. The child in me wanted to know
what she was thinking when she left my brothers behind. Didn't she
see the harm it would do to us all? But all she answered was: ``I
was at my wits' end in those days. Everything was falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``We had no money. I guess I just thought the boys
were living with Nana and Gerhard and they were better off.'' Leave
her be, I told myself, as I looked out over the graves of my
ancestors. What good can come from dredging up painful memories?
</P>
<P>
   My father died of cancer in 1998 in New York City at age 76. I
hadn't seen him for two years, though I had kept track of his
acting career, which included a role in ``Forrest Gump.'' A group
of my father's friends arranged a memorial to be held in his
apartment building _ though I finally could not bear to go to the
service, all those years late. My grief and anger over his
abandonment was still strong. A friend brought me a videotape of
the service.
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased to see a parade of mourners of all colors walk to
the front of the room and say kind things about my father. They
said he had stopped drinking, that he had found peace with God,
that he had become like a grandfather to some of the children in
the building. It was the kind of integrated gathering he had fought
for and loved. One speaker was a stylishly dressed white man in his
late 60s. He said he and my father had spent a lot of time talking
about my father's childhood. The man started choking up and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   The man, it turned out, was a psychologist my father had started
seeing when he was 70. A few months after watching the tape, I
called him. We talked about the fact that Bill had fathered seven
children with four different women _ three white, one black. With
the obvious exception of my sister, I barely know any of them. ``He
was repeatedly touching on the issue of white women as if he were
trying to make rational in somebody else's eyes how he had lived
his life,'' the therapist said. ``He couldn't see it as accidental
that he had a succession of nonblack women in his life who gave
birth to his children.''
</P>
<P>
   The therapist said that my father wanted to have racially mixed
children in part to prove himself to his mother. As a boy he had
been passed from relative to relative and was never really sure of
who his father was. Bill also told the therapist that his mother
had been disappointed that his skin was a dark shade. By having
lighter, mixed-race children, he was saying, the therapist
concluded: ``'Look at these beautiful children I've produced.' It
was a search for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that chasing white women was more than that for my
father. It was about fighting back against pre-civil rights
America. One thing that my father liked about white women, he told
his therapist, was the fact that seeing them on his thick brown arm
drove white men crazy. It reminded me of something my father had
told me once: ``I took my wife anywhere I wanted to go. I'm a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after my father died, I wandered through his apartment.
I ran my hands over his books, his saxophone and the photograph on
the wall of his hero, Paul Robeson, dressed as Othello. My father's
love for Robeson was one of the few uncomplicated joys we shared.
After my father died, all I wanted was that picture. I took the
picture down and hugged it. Then I peeked into my father's closet
and slipped on his too-big-for-me leather jacket, knotting the belt
tightly like a little boy playing Daddy. I took a series of deep
breaths and inhaled the aroma of his pipes, lifting them to my nose
from the carousel on the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from under his bed, I pulled a small strongbox with a
broken lock. It was full of documents. One was a copy of my birth
certificate. I was surprised and touched that he had it. Then I
noticed what he had done to it. On lines 8 and 13 of the document,
the clerk's office for Cook County, Ill., had recorded that my
father was ``Negro'' and my mother ``Caucasian.'' My father,
however, had a different idea. Using dark blue ink, he had crossed
out the references to race on my birth certificate, leaving just
``father'' and ``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, he tried to give me a gift that could not be
fully realized in his life: the gift of family that transcends
divisions of race. On paper, it was that simple.

 (EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, The New York Times has been publishing
a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived in America.'' The final
articles in the series appear in the July 16 issue of The New York
Times Magazine. The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. Due to the length of some the articles, papers with severe
space restraints may choose to spread a single article over several
days.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago I found myself moderating a panel, all of whose
participants were people of color. I no longer remember the topic.
I do remember that each of us was supposed to make an introductory
statement, and that when we got to my Chinese-American friend, he
announced that he could talk about race but did not intend to.
``Race can be so boring,'' he said, and then sat back to see what
would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Each face in the crowd looked stricken, outraged, relieved or
cautious. (The cautious ones kept glancing around to see which
expression would win out before they committed themselves). But I
was tickled. My friend wasn't asking any of us to ignore race; he
was trying his best to provoke a discussion that just might be
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Race is no longer a biological reality. Scientists have shown
that there are more differences within designated racial groups
than between them. It's race history that matters now; our culture,
our politics, the way our minds are formed and the oh-so-many
tricks our psyches play. We know that love, sex, friendship and
work don't take any one shape in our lives. Why do we coarsen and
simplify race so often? Why must we so often make it boring?
</P>
<P>
   To bore isn't simply to be dull and monotonous; it is to drive,
drill or close in relentlessly. When I was growing up it was a bore
to be praised over and over for acting like any other
upper-middle-class American. Speaking standardized English became
``You speak so beautifully'' or ``articulately.'' A father who was
a doctor and a mother who was a chic housewife could suddenly be a
cause of astonishment, delight or chilly disbelief, as in this
exchange from my elementary school years: The parent of a friend:
``And what does your father do?''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``He's a pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   Parent: ``A pediatrician? Are you sure you don't mean a
podiatrist?''
</P>
<P>
   I repeated this exchange to my mother and she explained the
subtext with chagrin and reluctance. I must be prepared for such
remarks, she said, but everyone wasn't so insecure or so
prejudiced. Did it affect all of my relations with schoolmates, not
least the child of this rude and doubting parent? No.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of thing came and went, like bad and good weather,
like a slap or a scolding followed by ease and good times. I used
to think it a luxury that the whites I knew didn't have to think so
much about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consciously think about race'' is what I should have said, for
race was there, knocking around in the nether regions of their
minds, lurching to the surface in all kinds of ways. The part of a
person that must study race consciously from childhood on - race
etiquette, race facts and fictions, race terrors, delights and
grotesqueries - is studying a second language. Nowadays, everybody
seems to need one. And languages are best learned early in life.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't want to sound smug. This learning can overwhelm you
in all kinds of ways. Your ideas can get stale and repetitive. Your
vocabulary can get stunted. Your defenses can start to matter more
than the freedom to think and act as you please. And then there are
the scoldings and penalties when you make a mistake. How could you,
how dare you shame your own people by doing something that showed
them in a bad light? And how little it used to take for that light
to shine! At one point I developed an unsavory habit of tidying up
any public bathroom I'd been in lest the white person who came in
next thought me responsible for such slovenliness. ``You can get
away with this - I can't,'' I would think, in scorn and despair.
</P>
<P>
   What a dreary little compulsion. Boring in the deepest sense,
for we are wrong to think of boredom as a kind of civilized
weariness. To be in the grip of boredom is to be paralyzed, stuck
in a past that makes the present hopeless and the future pointless.
The storytellers and the audience keep changing, but the story
stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   It would bore me, for instance _ I would find it unbearable, in
fact _ to think that anyone reading this believes that the Race
Question takes up all my social and psychic time. Whole portions of
my life are spent acting, thinking and dreaming in ways that have
nothing to do with racial crisis; moving between white and black
culture with pleasure and a sense of entitlement. And I don't
always bother to call them ``black'' and ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   Race is permanently stored in my memory. (In America, if it's
not stored in your memory it's stored in your fantasies.) Sometimes
I summon it up and arrange it in all sorts of ways. Sometimes
circumstances demand a quite conventional narrative. And sometimes
race is there but not there, like those galaxies that are invisible
to the naked eye and can only be seen accurately when one turns the
most refined equipment on them with the greatest care.

   RACE-BIRACIAL-FAMILY-CENTERPIECE _ When I was a kid growing up
in Chicago, I used to do anything I could to put off going to bed.
One of my favorite delaying tactics was to engage my mother in a
discussion about the important questions of the day, questions my
friends and I had debated in the backyards of our neighborhood that
afternoon _ like who did God root for, the Cubs or the White Sox?
(The correct answer was, and still is, the White Sox.) Then one
night I remember asking my mother something I had been wondering
for a long time. ``Mom,'' I asked, ``What am I?'' ``You're my
darling Donny,'' she said. ``I know. But what else am I?'' ``You're
a precious little boy who someday will grow up to be a wonderful,
handsome man.'' ``What I mean is, you're white and Dad's black, so
what does that make me?'' By Don Terry. (6,000 words.)

   RACE-FORUM-CENTERPIECE _ In a forum held at The New York Times
on June 19, eight editors and reporters talked about working on the
paper's ``How Race Is Lived in America'' project. Specifically,
they were asked how their own attitudes about race were affected by
the experience. Their comments help to underscore how complicated
the issue of race remains. Moderated by Sam Roberts. (2,600 words;
unabridged 4,100-word version available.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fierce tri-headed god
</P>
<P>
   From whence is thy origin?
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, ``Made in Taiwan''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Immunity Idol Haiku,'' one of more than 30 such poems about
``Survivor'' on an Internet web site.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the summer of 2000, we know Rudy is the crusty alum of
the Navy SEALs and Richard is the wickedly manipulative, openly gay
teddy bear and Colleen is the lust-inducing cute one who's lighting
up the Internet message boards and Gervase is the YMCA coach who
can't run or swim.
</P>
<P>
   But by the summer of 2001 we'll have forgotten all that. We
won't even be able to remember the names of the mouthy truck driver
(Susan!) or the doctor with the nipple ring (Sean!) or the nice and
relatively normal woman with the ukulele who was kicked off the
island in Episode 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops, forgot her name already.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, most of the contestants on the irresistibly cheesy
``Survivor'' are happily lapping up their notoriety like overheated
puppies unleashed on a gigantic bowl of cool spring water. Whether
it's the loser of the week gamely bantering with Bryant Gumble,
Sean telling Dan Rather he'd be thrilled to find the National
Enquirer going through his garbage, Rudy winning a fishing contest
or Ramona yukking it up with Dave Letterman, they're all having the
time of their lives, having nabbed the ultimate modern-day goal of
instant fame.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two months, these Gilligan-wannabes have no doubt
attained better name-and-face recognition than the justices of the
U.S. Supreme Court. You think I'm kidding? Go to any shopping mall
in America, armed with glossy photos of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
and Pagong tribe member Gretchen, and you'll see who elicits the
most reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna's on the cover of Time; Richard's all over the news wires;
Dr. Sean actually has professional headshots he's autographing for
fans. It's all good, as the kids say.
</P>
<P>
   But what these fresh faces don't seem to comprehend is that they
haven't won the lifetime lottery of fame _ they've nabbed a
temporary pass that gets them past the velvet rope for a short
while, but will soon morph into a ticket to obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The entire world _ including various members of the ``Survivor''
gang in interviews I've seen _ likes to quote the Andy Warholism
about everyone being famous for 15 minutes, but nobody seems to
pick up on the unspoken conclusion to that thought, i.e., if you're
famous for 15 minutes, that means you're destined to be obscure for
about 39,420,000 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the nearly decade-long run of the ``The Real World'' has
taught us anything, it's that these putative reality shows rarely
serve as launching pads to greater fame and fortune. They're
pseudo-celebrity sausage machines, grinding out dignity-impaired,
single-named exhibitionists (Judd! Julie!) who bare their
personalities and souls for our voyeuristic amusement, not
realizing that the fascination and adoration (and often the
derision) will soon give way to one gigantic national shrug of
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Amaya needs bodyguards when she goes out in
public, OK?
</P>
<P>
   It was just last year when MTV viewers lived and died with the
soap-operatic struggles of Ruthie, the skinnydipping, sexually
ambiguous, alcoholic showboat from ``The Real World: Hawaii.''
These days Ruthie wouldn't attract much of a crowd if she were
hired to drop her top and serve margaritas at a gentlemen's club.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a Puck or an Eric or a post-mortem Pedro might achieve a
level of fame that extends beyond the run of a show _ but even then
it's a fifth-tier kind of thing, putting them in the same category
as Court TV defendants, infomercial hucksters and televangelists.
(Consider Sarah from the ``Real World: Miami,'' now selling her
toys, clothes, you name it, on sarahscrap.com.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that reality television makes it easier for
average citizens to become instant celebrities, an extended stint
in the spotlight remains a nearly impossible feat unless one is
armed with genuine talent that sets one apart from the field. (Or
if you're a Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   And even Fame Lite is more diluted now than it was back in the
Kato Kaelin Era of the mid-1990s. With the ``Real World'' alumni
club numbering close to 70, not to mention all those ``Road Rules''
players and ``Survivor'' castaways, we may be reaching the point of
reality-celeb saturation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rapidly-dwindling ratings of the fledgling ``Big
Brother,'' from 22.5 million viewers Wednesday to 6.5 million by
Saturday, could be the first sign that real people sitting at home
are getting tired of watching real people bickering on TV.

DAUBACH HANDLED THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brian Daubach took the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Big Armando Benitez, the flame-throwing closer for the New York
Mets, was working with the lead and the count was in his favor (1
and 2). And he went with the heat again.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach watched it. Or at least watched it as much as anyone can
watch a 97-mile-per-hour fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Up, up, and away. Just a tad up and a tad away.
</P>
<P>
   Ball two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up and away,'' said Pedro Martinez, who knows a little
about heat and strikes and watched this one over again from the Red
Sox clubhouse. ``Benitez made the pitch to get him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daubach held back, and Benitez had to throw another heater.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was just a little inside, and Daubach ripped the
pitch deep to right field. And when the ball landed at the base of
the wall, it didn't bounce into the stands, and no fan reached over
to interfere with it, the Red Sox had a couple of breaks on one
play. Manny Alexander scored from third and Jose Offerman _ who
would have gone back to third on a ground-rule double _ scored from
first and the Red Sox walked off with a win. They'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those must have been Red Sox fans in the front row; if they
were Mets fans they probably would have grabbed it,'' Daubach said.
``We didn't catch many breaks in the first half (of the season). We
got lucky a little bit in the ninth with the error and that ball
staying in play for us. Maybe that will get us going. It's a good
way to start the second half, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach didn't sound quite as sure as Martinez on the 1-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been surprised if he called it,'' Daubach
said. ``But I would have been upset. It would have been a tough
pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a chance for redemption. In the fifth inning, with
one out and the bases loaded, he popped to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get a second chance,'' Daubach said.
</P>
<P>
   He got the ninth-inning at-bat. And he made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close,'' Daubach said of the reprieve on the 1-and-2
pitch. ``I knew I better swing after that. I wasn't taking anymore
close ones. When you face a closer, especially a guy like Benitez,
his best pitch is his fastball, and you know he's going to come
after you.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Benitez had to think about Nomar Garciaparra
on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch to hit,'' Daubach said. ``He's got to come
after me, especially with Nomar on deck. Not too many teams want to
face Nomar with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth in a
one-run game. They had to come at me.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. This time they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach leads the team with 26 RBIs from the seventh inning on.
In his last 11 games, he is hitting .405 (15 for 37) with 14 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach may have been further inspired by facing the Mets, the
team that drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially because it's my old team,'' Daubach said. ``They
gave up on me a long time ago. That makes it a little extra
special. It seems when I play against the Marlins and the Mets I
try to do a little too much. But it feels good. That's all I can
really say.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt good all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Benitez, he's tough,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``All
you have to do is look at his numbers, what people do against him.
No one really hits him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers: Righthanders were batting .178 against Benitez;
lefthanders like Daubach had it even tougher at .125.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put up a tremendous at-bat,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He took the heat. And won.

NEAGLE WAS NOT A PRIORITY FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox had higher priorities than pursuing Denny
Neagle, the newest Yankee, Boston general manager Dan Duquette said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Neagle, a lefthanded starter acquired Wednesday
in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, has a 14-2 record since last
August. In Duquette's view, the Sox need hitting help more than
pitching, though several Boston players who have faced Neagle in
the National League described his acquisition as a potential boon
for the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware Neagle was on the market,'' Duquette said before
Thursday's game with the Mets. ``But we're more focused on helping
our team with run production at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox players had no quarrel with Duquette's priorities. But
they shared little doubt about Neagle's potential impact on the
American League East race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who can help the Yankees a lot,'' said Manny
Alexander, who faced Neagle in his three seasons in the NL with the
Cubs and Mets. ``He will pitch seven or eight innings and keep his
team in the game. They're a tough team already, but now that
they've got another lefty, they could be even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bernard Gilkey, who played in the NL for St. Louis, New
York, and Arizona, ``Neagle, when he is on, has the potential to
shut you down, so he is definitely an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague, another former National Leaguer, described Neagle as
a ``Jimmy Key type'' of finesse pitcher with certified big-league
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good pickup for them,'' Sprague said, ``although
anytime you can pick up a big-league starting pitcher these days
it's a good pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the Red Sox clubhouse was awed by the notion of
Neagle in pinstripes. ``I didn't care at all,'' injured right
fielder Trot Nixon said. ``They can get as many guys as they want.
You still have to go out and play the game. That's the bottom line.
Neagle's having a pretty good year, but it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Derek Lowe, Boston's All-Star closer, undone by the
deal. ``You can't worry about who's on another club,'' he said.
``You knew they were going to get somebody. It was good for them.
It adds consistency to their rotation. But you can't win around one
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Lowe said, ``If we can stay consistent in the
second half, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite shaky outings before the All-Star break by Boston's two
lefthanded starters _ Jeff Fassero and Pete Schourek _ Duquette
said he hoped the return from the disabled list of Pedro Martinez
would provide ``a shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching staff is still intact,'' Duquette said, though he
made clear that Paxton Crawford is poised to rejoin the team ``in
the event we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a rookie righthander, was sent back to Pawtucket
before the All-Star break after strong starts in his only two
appearances with the big club. But Duquette said the demotion was
meant only ``to keep him sharp during the break.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette's recipe for success hinges in part on the successful
return of his rehabbing pitchers, including two-time Cy Young Award
winner Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, 36, who underwent major reconstructive surgery last
November on his right shoulder, continued his arduous recovery
regimen Thursday by pitching in his second simulated game in a
week. He threw 42 pitches over three innings and ``did very well,''
according to pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``It looks pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   If he continues on pace, Saberhagen will pitch Tuesday, almost
certainly in Lowell for the Spinners. Saberhagen, despite three
stints on the disabled list, won 10 games last year for the Sox,
more than any Boston pitcher except Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat alone in an empty clubhouse while his teammates took
batting practice, Saberhagen offered a restrained assessment of
Thursday's outing. ``Everything went well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Scott Hatteberg, who watched Saberhagen throw, said he
``looked really good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very encouraging,'' Hatteberg said. ``Hopefully, he'll
advance. It all depends on his shoulder, but I'd love to see him
get back. If he can do it and we can be in the run, he'll be huge
for us.''

GARCIAPARRA'S FRIENDSHIP FIRES PAYTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Something good must have rubbed off on Jay Payton when
he embraced his good friend Nomar Garciaparra before Thursday's
game at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Payton must have borrowed some of Garciaparra's .390 mojo,
because he didn't look at all like the player who finished the
first half in a 1-for-15 slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' rookie center fielder went 2 for 4 with an RBI double
and a solo homer in the Mets' 4-3 loss. But those weren't just any
two hits. Those were two hits against arguably the best pitcher in
baseball, Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he's on the field I seem to do OK,'' Payton said of
Garciaparra, his roommate and teammate for three years at Georgia
Tech. ``Even when I played in the minor leagues, the short time
that he was there, when I played against him I seemed to do well.
Maybe he's a little bit of good luck for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable today. I finished (the first half of
the season) on kind of a sour note. I just wanted to come in today
and try to get off to a good start in the second half. I saw the
ball good, put some good swings on it, and fortunately, some good
things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of good things have happened to Payton during his
seven-year career. Drafted by New York in the first round of the
1994 free agent draft, he's been as much a regular on the disabled
list as he has in the starting lineup. Check out his medical
history:
</P>
<P>
   1995: Reconstructive surgery on the medial collateral ligament
in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   1996: Surgery to remove bone spurs from his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   1997: Missed the entire season after another surgery on the
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   1998: Arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. Oh yeah, and a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   1999: Left shoulder surgery and an oblique strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very blessed to be playing this game right now,'' said
Payton, who took over in center field when Darryl Hamilton went on
the disabled list after the sixth game of the season. ``So I just
go out and have fun, try not to do too much, and try not to put too
much pressure on myself. Just try to go out and have fun playing
the game and help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly did his part Thursday night. In the second inning,
Martinez threw him a changeup low and inside, but Payton reached
and pulled it down the left-field line for a double that scored
Todd Zeile from second and give the Mets a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Payton struck out in the fifth, but in the seventh, with the
Mets trailing, 2-1, Payton sent a 2-2 pitch from Martinez over the
wall for his ninth home run of the season and 29th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's been playing well,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He's been a big-leaguer for us. Hopefully he's coming right into
his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra knew Payton had it in him all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he can play,'' said Garciaparra, who went 2 for 4 but
was robbed of a third hit and a couple of RBIs when Payton chased
down his deep drive to center to end the fifth inning with the
bases full of Red Sox. ``It doesn't surprise me that he got two
hits today. Anything he does doesn't shock me. He's always been
good, all you have to do is give him a chance, he'll show
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra should know. He and Payton led Tech to the College
World Series in 1994. That year Garciaparra batted .427. Payton
batted .434. But they've traveled different paths since then. While
Garciaparra has become a star in the big leagues, it's been a
struggle for Payton just to get there. Until this season, he'd only
played in 28 games with the Mets during brief call-ups in 1998 and
'99.
</P>
<P>
   But the two have stayed close. They keep in touch over the
phone, and Garciaparra took Payton with him when the Major League
All-Stars played an exhibition in Japan in the fall of '98. Seeing
Garciaparra flourish encourages Payton that he, too, can someday be
one of baseball's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for him,'' Payton said. ``It kind of gave me some
confidence that, hey, if I can get back and get to playing, then I
got a good chance to play in the big leagues. To see him having
such success was kind of a confidence-builder for me, just to try
to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through so much,'' Garciaparra said. ``And he's
overcome a lot. He's an inspiration. If I'm down I call him, or
he'll call me up. If he's down, I'm there for him. It's a great
friendship.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ The cornerstone is back in place.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen days after Red Sox management dislodged him against his
will from the active roster, Pedro Martinez Thursday night returned
and did what he does as masterfully as anyone in baseball: pitched
into the late innings and left his team in position to win.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Martinez, claiming he is fully healed from a
strained oblique muscle, must continue to do if his teammates
harbor any hope of October glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not God,'' he said after Brian Daubach's two-out,
two-strike walkoff double in the ninth beat the Mets, 4-3. ``Only
God knows if I'm going to be healthy (for the rest of the season).
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel pretty good right now,'' he said. ``I feel
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets who were pained as Martinez shackled the first
five hitters in the New York order, including his nemesis, Mike
Piazza, for seven innings. The Mets catcher entered the game
hitting .412 against Martinez, with three home runs in 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza and the other four Mets batting around him at the top
of the order went hitless against the Sox stopper.
</P>
<P>
   In seven innings, Martinez yielded two runs on five hits and a
walk. He struck out 10 for the eighth time this season, throwing at
92 miles per hour in the seventh, as he did in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dominant anytime,'' said Mets ace Mike Hampton. ``I don't
care if he hasn't pitched in a year. Anytime he's in the game, he's
going to give you a chance to win. And coming off the injury, he
gave them a quality start, and that's all you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one Met _ an unexpected Pedro Killer at that _ robbed
Martinez of a scoreless performance. Of the five hits Martinez
scattered over seven innings, only two hurt him, and both were
struck by Jay Payton, the Mets center fielder who is playing in his
first full major league season.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, a buddy of Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek from
their days at Georgia Tech, lined a run-producing double down the
left-field line in the second inning and hit a solo homer that just
cleared the wall in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had given Martinez a scouting report on Payton
before the game, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never faced the guy before, and it's hard for me to really
know which pitch to make,'' Martinez said. ``I can't just follow
the scouting report. I have to go by my own adjustments and
instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to fool Payton with a changeup, which turned into the
double. And he later tried to blow a fastball by him, but Payton
deposited it in the screen above Lansdowne Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I should throw a fastball up and in,'' Martinez
said. ``I left it a little lower than I wanted to, but I thought I
made a good pitch. You have to give him credit. I tip my hat to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach said Martinez's return gave the Sox a lift, even if he
had to settle for his third no-decision in four starts. Rich Garces
got the win, as Martinez remained winless since June 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see Pedro out there,'' Daubach said. ``It was
too bad we couldn't get him a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez continued to insist that the Red Sox should have kept
him in the starting rotation last month, though the rest appeared
to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel stronger, I feel rested, but I didn't agree with
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said Martinez ``came back really
fresh.''``He felt a little strange out there in the first inning or
two,'' Kerrigan said. ``But he settled down after 30 or 40 pitches.
Anybody who can take 18 days away from the battle and come back and
pitch like that is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams was equally impressed. ``A lot of people
expect more from him than other pitchers,'' Williams said. ``I
really don't. I look at him like a human being and enjoy the
moments when he pitches.''

PIAZZA BACK BEHIND PLATE WITH CLEAR HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Piazza went 1 for 4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't hit a home run. He didn't have an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets lost, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But he's back behind the plate. And that's just as beautiful a
sight for New Yorkers as one of his towering home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My) timing is off pretty bad,'' said Piazza, who came into
the game batting .348 with 24 homers and 72 RBIs. ``Just wasn't
taking good swings. I think that's to be expected. Four days off .
. . five actually. It's been a few days. I'm just trying to get
some timing back. Fortunately, I was able to eke out a hit in the
last at-bat. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment Saturday night, Piazza had to be wondering
whether he'd be eking out anything anytime soon. The Yankees' Roger
Clemens hit Piazza on the helmet with a fastball, knocking the
All-Star catcher to the ground with a slight concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza missed Sunday's Subway Series finale at Shea Stadium and
had to sit out the All-Star Game Tuesday in Atlanta. Sunday he
accused Clemens of intentionally throwing at him and said that he
didn't ``have respect for him right now at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, a much cooler version of Piazza reflected on his
time back in the batter's box. ``It's good just to get back out
there,'' said Piazza, who will DH Friday night and will likely pay
another visit to a neurologist when the Mets return to New York
July 25. ``It feels good, and I'm pretty lucky. I feel lucky, just
that there wasn't any more severe effects from it, and obviously I
wasn't hit in the face or anything like that. So, as I said, it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to move on against, of all people, Pedro Martinez. On
June 5, 1998, Martinez hit Piazza on his left hand in his first,
and before Thursday, his only regular-season at-bat on Yawkey Way.
Piazza accused Martinez, his former teammate with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, of hitting him on purpose. Piazza missed the last two
games of the interleague series, but the two continued to exchange
insults.
</P>
<P>
   They got reacquainted in the second inning, when Piazza stepped
to the plate for the first time since the Clemens incident. He
grounded out harmlessly to Ed Sprague. ``Ironically, I think the
first pitch Pedro threw me was up and in a little bit,'' Piazza
said after the game. ``I wasn't . . . flinching.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth and sixth innings, Piazza flew out to Jeff Frye in
right. Martinez left after the seventh inning, meaning Piazza
didn't get a chance to add to his .304 average (7 for 23) against
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza did end his evening at the plate on a positive note.
With two outs in the eighth against Rich Garces, he hit a soft
liner to center that Carl Everett misplayed. Edgardo Alfonzo scored
from first on the error, and Piazza wound up at second, though he
was not credited with an RBI for the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things,'' Piazza said of being beaned. He
was also hit in the head in 1991 while playing for Single A
Bakersfield. ``To do your job in this game, you have to have a
clear mind . . . You can't hit with one foot in the dugout and one
in the batter's box.''

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the brain, as in life, success often lies in striking a
balance between too much and too little of a good thing.
 &HT;    For example, you may think that the ability to keep your eyes
fixed upon objects is good, and for the most part, you would be
right. Thus, when you shake your noggin during an argument, you can
still stare your opponent down. This is possible because of a
small, internal accelerometer called the vestibular sensory organ,
which is located in the inner ear and senses head movements. It
allows the eyes to move in equal and opposite directions from the
head. But a perfectly fixed gaze, as you will see, has its hazards.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    Go to the mirror. Shake your head, but keep watching your eyes.
They will seem fixed, because the vestibular organ counteracts the
motion of the neck muscles. The net effect is a stabilized gaze _
more or less. The more-or-less part turns out to be very important.
Read on.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    Close your left eye, and hold this page about one foot away. Fix
your right eye on the diamond below. The green dot should vanish.
(You may need to move the page closer or farther before the dot
disappears.)
 &HT;    The green dot falls on your blind spot, the area on your retina
punched through by nerve fibers on their way to the brain. This
region can't register images that appear in front of it, but you
don't normally perceive a hole in your vision, because one eye
covers for the other.
 &HT;    More important for this discussion, the visual cells straddling
the blind area don't register the huge gap between them because the
retinal dead zone is permanently fixed, and visual neurons quickly
damp their responses to unchanging stimuli.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 3  
 &HT;    Prove this by turning the lights out and pointing the beam of a
small flashlight up into one pupil. Twirl the beam around while
switching your gaze back and forth. You should catch glimpses of
what look like delicate branches. The gauzy branches are shadows of
the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.
 &HT;    The vessels cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but
because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to
them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just
enough to make them momentarily visible.
 &HT;    But you can't cause images to fade just by staring at something
unmoving, because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye
muscles in a phenomenon called physiological nystagmus, which
prevents the perfect stabilization of images.
 &HT;    These muscle tremors are infinitesimal, but their effect is
huge. Without them, we would, in effect, go blind, tuning out what
we see shortly after fixating our gaze.
 &HT;    It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is more
perfect than perfect perfection.

 &HT;    Books for the novice woodturner
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two handsome paper-bound books, originally published
in England and offered here by Sterling, should be of considerable
interest to the novice woodturner looking for direction.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``Woodturning: a Fresh Approach'' by Robert Chapman and
``Bowl Turning Techniques Master Class'' by Tony Boase. Both list
for $17.95. Between them, these two books outline the basic
techniques used in just about every avenue of turning, from the
most basic bowl to stack-laminated work, reformed and painted
pieces and surface decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's book is the more detailed, and deals with the basic
concepts _ bowls, natural and formal-lipped; platters, boxes, and
closed or hollow vessels. Boase's book devotes one chapter to an
individual turner specializing in more advanced variations.
</P>
<P>
   Both these books are beautifully illustrated. As far as I could
make out the work displayed in Chapman's book is all his own, and
all the work in Boase's book as that of turners in the UK and
Ireland with the exception of the gallery in the back.
</P>
<P>
   I've been out of woodturning for a few years now, and I've never
heard of any of these people. Chapman, judging from the work shown
in his book, is an incredibly diverse and tasteful turner. The
artists in Boase's book are certainly first-rank, too.
</P>
<P>
   All the work on display here is outstanding, in stark contrast
to some of the turning books I've seen in the past.
</P>
<P>
   However, I would caution the beginner that wood turning, unlike
joinery, is not something that can be learned from a book. It is a
dynamic interaction between a piece of wood rotating at high speed,
a tool edge and the hands holding the tool.
</P>
<P>
   Videos, and there are good ones readily available, are more
useful for the beginner. Workshops and tutelage, of course, are
best.
</P>
<P>
   Once the beginner grasps the basics, it's a matter of practicing
until the mind no longer has to concentrate on the cutting action
itself, entrusting this to the hands while the consciousness goes
on to make decisions about form.
</P>
<P>
   These two books, while of interest to any turner, will be of
most use to the turner who has arrived at that happy state and is
beginning to move from technique to art.

 &HT;    LICENSING PUSH HAS GUN OWNERS FIGHTING MAD
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two words rally gun owners like nothing else:
licensing and registration.
</P>
<P>
   And with the latest Democratic party platform endorsing gun
control measures, such as child safety locks and strict background
checks, gun owners say they are increasingly worried.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Rifle Association's July newsletter, the group's
president, Charlton Heston, warns: ``Once some Gore government has
the names, addresses, photos and ownership inventories of every gun
owner in America, we all know what comes next. Once liberty is
transformed into license, that license can be revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, groups that advocate gun-control say that licensing
and registration will save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Licensing and registration) would make sure that the wrong
people don't get a hold of guns; make sure that people know how to
use guns properly; make it easier for police to trace crime guns
and detect gun traffickers; and it makes sense,'' said Nancy Hwa, a
spokesperson for Handgun Control, Inc., a group that supports gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of licensing and registration say it would help weed
out criminals who are trying to purchase firearms through legal
channels and that it would prevent illegal sales by making the
registered owner responsible for what happens to his or her own
gun.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a license, which includes a photo I.D., applicants
would have to pass a background check, including a check for
violent misdemeanor convictions, domestic violence and mental
illness. In addition, the applicant would have to demonstrate
knowledge of firearms safety and the laws governing the use,
possession, storage and transfer of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Hwa said that many people don't know how their own guns work or
what state and federal laws govern the sale and use of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that it's OK to shoot somebody in the back
or to shoot someone who is not even really threatening you,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way people who get car licenses must learn how the
vehicle works and the laws of the road, people who buy guns should
take a safety course and a test to prove that they know how to
handle a gun and that they know the rules, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But gun owners, such as Ken Bagby, say that licensing and
registration would only burden law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws that they are creating have nothing to do with
stopping crime. It is an issue that deals with the honest citizen
who will go register their gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby, who lives in Shelby, N.C., and has been a hunter since he
was a child, said that charging fees for licensing and registration
would discriminate against poor gun owners, who are often the most
vulnerable to crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it's $25 to register your gun, then it's $50, then it's
$200, then it's what have you...If a poor person can't afford that,
that's unfair as heck,'' he said. ``These are people that live on
the front line. They're in the housing projects. They need the
protection. The cops won't even go in there sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of more federal record-keeping also makes gun owners
uneasy as many are already skeptical of government and fear that
its ultimate goal is to disarm citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ifs, ands or buts about it...the more information
that's there makes it that much easier,'' Bagby said.
</P>
<P>
   Many gun owners have taken to the Internet to express such
fears. Dozens of sites, such as www.thefiringline.com, provide chat
rooms and other forums for concerned gun owners to share
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun owner in America gets really angry and activated by
this,'' said Josh Sugarmann (cq), executive director of the
Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based group that supports the
banning of handguns and other gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The intense reaction of the gun lobby to the issue of licensing
and registration is one of the reasons his group does not push it
as a solution to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger reason, the group says, is that licensing and
registration would have little effect on most U.S. gun violence
because most homicides are the result of arguments between people
who know each other and who purchase guns legally.
</P>
<P>
   The focus should be on the product and the manufacturer, not the
user, Sugarmann said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites as an example that licensing and registering of cars
had no effect on automobile deaths and injuries. Cars became safer
only after the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration
was established and mandated road safety improvements and changes
to car designs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to national licensing and registering also say it
would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the government originally estimated that licensing
and registration of that country's 7 million guns would cost about
$185 million Canadian ($125 million U.S.) over five years. The
project, which began in December 1998, has already cost more than
$320 million Canadian ($216 million U.S.), according to the
Canadian Firearms Centre.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 65 million handguns in the U.S, the cost of
such a system could be staggering.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of a national licensing and registration system
say that saving lives would offset any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely think it would be (worth it) compared to the
costs of the gun violence that we have in this country _ the
economic costs, the human costs and emotional costs,'' Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
   While licensing and registration of firearms is a major goal for
gun control advocates, it has not been on the Congressional radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not included in a package of gun control proposals
_ currently stuck in Congress _ that includes stricter background
checks at gunshows, requiring child safety locks on guns, and
banning the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the brain, as in life, success often lies in striking a
balance between too much and too little of a good thing.
 &HT;    For example, you may think that the ability to keep your eyes
fixed upon objects is good, and for the most part, you would be
right. Thus, when you shake your noggin during an argument, you can
still stare your opponent down. This is possible because of a
small, internal accelerometer called the vestibular sensory organ,
which is located in the inner ear and senses head movements. It
allows the eyes to move in equal and opposite directions from the
head. But a perfectly fixed gaze, as you will see, has its hazards.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    Go to the mirror. Shake your head, but keep watching your eyes.
They will seem fixed, because the vestibular organ counteracts the
motion of the neck muscles. The net effect is a stabilized gaze _
more or less. The more-or-less part turns out to be very important.
Read on.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    Close your left eye, and hold this page about one foot away. Fix
your right eye on the diamond below. The green dot should vanish.
(You may need to move the page closer or farther before the dot
disappears.)
 &HT;    The green dot falls on your blind spot, the area on your retina
punched through by nerve fibers on their way to the brain. This
region can't register images that appear in front of it, but you
don't normally perceive a hole in your vision, because one eye
covers for the other.
 &HT;    More important for this discussion, the visual cells straddling
the blind area don't register the huge gap between them because the
retinal dead zone is permanently fixed, and visual neurons quickly
damp their responses to unchanging stimuli.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 3  
 &HT;    Prove this by turning the lights out and pointing the beam of a
small flashlight up into one pupil. Twirl the beam around while
switching your gaze back and forth. You should catch glimpses of
what look like delicate branches. The gauzy branches are shadows of
the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.
 &HT;    The vessels cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but
because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to
them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just
enough to make them momentarily visible.
 &HT;    But you can't cause images to fade just by staring at something
unmoving, because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye
muscles in a phenomenon called physiological nystagmus, which
prevents the perfect stabilization of images.
 &HT;    These muscle tremors are infinitesimal, but their effect is
huge. Without them, we would, in effect, go blind, tuning out what
we see shortly after fixating our gaze.
 &HT;    It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is more
perfect than perfect perfection.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the brain, as in life, success often lies in striking a
balance between too much and too little of a good thing.
 &HT;    For example, you may think that the ability to keep your eyes
fixed upon objects is good, and for the most part, you would be
right. Thus, when you shake your noggin during an argument, you can
still stare your opponent down. This is possible because of a
small, internal accelerometer called the vestibular sensory organ,
which is located in the inner ear and senses head movements. It
allows the eyes to move in equal and opposite directions from the
head. But a perfectly fixed gaze, as you will see, has its hazards.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    Go to the mirror. Shake your head, but keep watching your eyes.
They will seem fixed, because the vestibular organ counteracts the
motion of the neck muscles. The net effect is a stabilized gaze _
more or less. The more-or-less part turns out to be very important.
Read on.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    Close your left eye, and hold this page about one foot away. Fix
your right eye on the diamond below. The green dot should vanish.
(You may need to move the page closer or farther before the dot
disappears.)
 &HT;    The green dot falls on your blind spot, the area on your retina
punched through by nerve fibers on their way to the brain. This
region can't register images that appear in front of it, but you
don't normally perceive a hole in your vision, because one eye
covers for the other.
 &HT;    More important for this discussion, the visual cells straddling
the blind area don't register the huge gap between them because the
retinal dead zone is permanently fixed, and visual neurons quickly
damp their responses to unchanging stimuli.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 3  
 &HT;    Prove this by turning the lights out and pointing the beam of a
small flashlight up into one pupil. Twirl the beam around while
switching your gaze back and forth. You should catch glimpses of
what look like delicate branches. The gauzy branches are shadows of
the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.
 &HT;    The vessels cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but
because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to
them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just
enough to make them momentarily visible.
 &HT;    But you can't cause images to fade just by staring at something
unmoving, because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye
muscles in a phenomenon called physiological nystagmus, which
prevents the perfect stabilization of images.
 &HT;    These muscle tremors are infinitesimal, but their effect is
huge. Without them, we would, in effect, go blind, tuning out what

 &HT;    It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is more
perfect than perfect perfection.

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On the north side of the Yamuna River in central India lies a
rural floodplain of wheat and mustard fields, low forests and poor
farming villages. It seems an unlikely place on which to pin any
hopes. Yet the site has become a key component in the Indian
government's plans to preserve the Taj Mahal, the extraordinary
shrine erected by 17th-century Mogul emperor Shah Jahan to house
the remains of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
 &HT;    About 350 years ago, when the Taj was built on the Yamuna's
south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass
prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and
the wind never seems to let up.
 &HT;    Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is
downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers
scatter.
 &HT;    My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last
July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ``red
people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many
American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw.
 &HT;    Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first
capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband,
John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the
town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache,
Western Delaware and Wichita.
 &HT;    Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for
20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825,
when the U.S. government promised it to the Plains Indians and what
were known as the Five Civilized Tribes _ Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek,
Chickasaw, and Seminole _ ``for as long as grass grows and water
runs.''
 &HT;    Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and
spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great
Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.
 &HT;    Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at
intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our
extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of
Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from
Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.
 &HT;    ``When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church,
pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three
miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo
Edringer.
 &HT;    She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a
tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows
in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat
meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish,
listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.
 &HT;    After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden
prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea
and frybread, then led us to the tepees.
 &HT;    ``They're all authentic,'' she said. ``This one is made in the
Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the
packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center,
dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the
side to create a snow break.
 &HT;    The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself
calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in.
 &HT;    ``Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us,
raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the
grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff _ all Indian _
were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged
a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind,
and here it was still.
 &HT;    That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to
a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Redbone is an
Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking
place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones
were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in
the fierce wind at the top of the hill.
 &HT;    Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Redbone's
brother-in-law was ``cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then
the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of
seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed
along each of our faces with a feather fan.
 &HT;    I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept
quietly in one's heart. ``Once we tell you a story it's not ours
anymore,'' he replied.
 &HT;    The Apache lifeway _ an American Indian term for lifestyle _ is
so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings
so that someone, anyone, might remember.
 &HT;    By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town
of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance
was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center.
 &HT;    Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies
painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red
scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great
battle.
 &HT;    The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind
man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that
together they may be rescued. One dancer in the group was a boy of
10 or so, learning by following along.
 &HT;    The next morning _ awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of
birdsong _ we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an
active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the
southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort
Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there
until his death in 1909.
 &HT;    Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner-of-war cemetery under
an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage
site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they
spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and
inaccessible.
 &HT;    Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National
Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the
Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside
the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world
might have looked like while the Indians were still pursuing their
lifeway.
 &HT;    A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer
wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky
Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma
City to the northeast.
 &HT;    The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central
and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend. This part of the state
was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole
after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a
Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the
Mississippi River.
 &HT;    Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they
recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of
Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning
instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress,
which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.
 &HT;    We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the
town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the
Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state
at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40
toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds,
earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.
 &HT;    By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national
historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee
intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ``talking
leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a
result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight.
 &HT;    Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee.
Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee
alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating
English word sounds into Cherokee.
 &HT;    By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk,
which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross
the highway in front of us.
 &HT;    We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had
reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan
Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional
steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By
nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of
silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.
 &HT;    In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds.
The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from
copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the
Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive
center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the
state and all over the world.
 &HT;    Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like
grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us
amused by leaping across the walkway.
 &HT;    The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout
way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a
re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently
didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games
and gaming gear.
 &HT;    From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating
ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the
town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view
out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the
ranch's noisy dogs.
 &HT;    We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again,
where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as
blood.
 &HT;    When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the
vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our
way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the
horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning.
 &HT;    It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee. A brightly colored
circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field
around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it
and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before
reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the
survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly
revered.
 &HT;    The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the
Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ``first nation.''
Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues,
squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken.
 &HT;    The evening progressed through different categories: junior
men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by
ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.
 &HT;    Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search
of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee
or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in
the breeze; an outstretched shawl becomes a butterfly. It is part
of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a
complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.
 &HT;    Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry,
prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths
selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ``Free Leonard Peltier'' pins
and bumper stickers.
 &HT;    Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in
prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing
two FBI agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands
sell Indian tacos and frybread.
 &HT;    Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before
setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took
a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were
welcomed with a genial indifference.
 &HT;    At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an
eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked
four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its
lost power.
 &HT;    Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw
Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside
Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into
the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater.
 &HT;    Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near
the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket
dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the
drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the
singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song.
 &HT;    We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the
circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the
men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never
called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching
headdress.
 &HT;    At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a
ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw
descent. He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw
friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a
second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family
reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By WAYNE CURTIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly
emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these
days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well,
the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland.
 &HT;    Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old
Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture.
The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts
district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's
decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students
after its owners decamped to a mall.
 &HT;    On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders
talking of soaring real-estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who
have started to trickle in.
 &HT;    Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European
trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco
Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer
weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost
everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one
would expect for a city of 65,000.
 &HT;    The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders
have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and
there's growing concern that too much attention will bring
unwelcome change.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air
when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will
converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207)
541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland
festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the
tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of
two 19th-century forts.
 &HT;    Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern
Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay
Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include
fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront,
ship tours and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.
 &HT;    The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21
to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of
Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year
will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in
Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with
costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and
splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.
 &HT;    The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067,
is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of
the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known
for his vivid illustrations of books like ``Treasure Island,'' but
he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from
Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the
paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.
 &HT;    The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207)
761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances
each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon
Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the
accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets
are $10, $5 for children.
 &HT;    The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to
6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers,
artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000
visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach
campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles
north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance,
with discounts for seniors and children.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland
Observatory, 138 Congress St., (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one
of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped
tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of
incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after
a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a
vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.
 &HT;    The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better
appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural
details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead.
 &HT;    The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and
restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial
architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last
great fire swept through the city.
 &HT;    Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State St., (207) 774-5561,
publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for
$1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking
tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a
half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours
is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305
Commercial St., (207) 772-5800.
 &HT;    In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century
neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the
Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth St., (207) 772-4841, one of the
nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture.
Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a
lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is
open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.
 &HT;    Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of
sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands
that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the
17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer
Robert E. Peary.
 &HT;    The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the
island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and
stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours,
Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with
reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.
 &HT;    Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000
Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly
familiar _ it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light
dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first
keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the
site, was built in 1891.
 &HT;    The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public,
but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the
harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The
park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.
 &HT;    On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south
to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by
chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal St., (207)
772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884.
It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with
antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135
to $225, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the
welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth St.; (207) 879-8755, fax (207)
879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former
servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1
has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have
access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to
$285, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine St., (207) 871-7638, fax (207)
775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West
End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early
Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those
facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious
than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with
breakfast.
 &HT;    The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring St., (800) 437-8511 or (207)
774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the
art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city
restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black
Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800)
258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century
buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean.
 &HT;    Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest
rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are
generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style.
Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged
elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at
picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.
 &HT;    Natasha's, 40 Portland St., (207) 774-4004, features new
American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that
features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork
loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab.
Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch.
Dinner for two with wine, about $60.
 &HT;    At Ribollita, 41 Middle St., (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the
chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other
Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with
white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter,
and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for
dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about
$70.
 &HT;    Bella Cucina, 653 Congress St., (207) 828-4033, combines
romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow
tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves
up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options.
 &HT;    The menu changes according to availability of ingredients;
expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a
parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served
over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for
two, with wine.
 &HT;    The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High St., (207)
774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate
specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly
good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion
wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing
martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open
nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis:
$75.
 &HT;    Silly's, 40 Washington Ave., (207) 772-0360, will satisfy
aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger
food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular,
as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut
fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the
customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15
to $20 for two.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MELANIE REHAK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the
start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments,
leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate
around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen.
 &HT;    These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my
excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic:
camping.
 &HT;    The idea of sleeping under the stars _ even seeing the stars _
epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that
the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze,
and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.
 &HT;    Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in
New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant
attributes of outdoor life _ the crackle of the fire, the sound of
the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite _ came some
rather difficult logistics.
 &HT;    Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles
had to be put together piece by piece by piece _ an endless
process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded
me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds.
 &HT;    The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no
matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and
twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting
marshmallows on fire.
 &HT;    Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched
innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully
portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a
benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!).
 &HT;    I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded
discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off
the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook
(after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not
dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and
ate scores of hot dogs.
 &HT;    As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I
finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it
had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror
intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion
was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to
camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
 &HT;    Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in
search of a tent _ and got something of a shock. Navigating the
outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed
very far away.
 &HT;    Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing
through the L.L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even five
years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site
of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear
store.
 &HT;    Then I found the link to the REI Outlet Web site,
(www.rei-outlet.com) designed for _ not to mention directed at _
people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical
prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.
 &HT;    Within minutes, I had located the perfect tent for the perfect
price ($52.95). It was made of hunter-green nylon, and had
fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the
front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I
couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it
was mine.
 &HT;    Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time
cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered
on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without.
Most of it was stuff I'd never heard of.
 &HT;    There were ``hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from
built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30
styles of hiking shoes _ for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes,
summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in
10 styles. There were water-filtration systems, gourmet cook sets,
even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.
 &HT;    While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable _
for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not
absorb water _ a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need
microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping
trip? Yet they were tempting.
 &HT;    True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like
hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire.
But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that
certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a
headlamp and a two-way radio _ just in case someone gets lost
looking for the water tap.
 &HT;    I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner
of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.
 &HT;    When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We
pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for
battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles
and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five
minutes.
 &HT;    Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up
the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to
do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that
was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had
arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell
asleep on my air mattress.
 &HT;    A few hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of
collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a
gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was
going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore,
had we remembered bug spray?
 &HT;    In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I
remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well
up.
 &HT;    I found this oddly comforting _ all the high-tech efficiency was
getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans
cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with
s'mores and then it was time for bed.
 &HT;    The trip to the wash house wasn't bad _ we walked along the path
with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in
against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and
insects.
 &HT;    Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and
wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my
sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises
outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had
scanned on the REI site, ``Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food
Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to
the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go
back to sleep.
 &HT;    I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and
ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would
he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me?
 &HT;    My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered
front flap grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was
absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.
 &HT;    Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen
flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all,
cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and
because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my
sneakers were squishy with dew.
 &HT;    The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the
unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the
night, was still great.

 (PLEASE NOTE: The word AT in parentheses has been used in an e-mail
address instead of the symbol, which many computer systems at

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I'm looking for a sleek and modern hotel in the heart of
Seattle. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Plush chenille pillows, intimate lighting and an impressive
24-hour concierge service are just a handful of the special touches
that guests can expect at the new W Hotel in Seattle.
 &HT;    Part of the brand-driven W hotel chain launched by Starwood
Hotels and Resorts, the W Seattle is a unique refuge for business
and leisure travelers who have a penchant for hip hotels that
combine sophisticated urban style with relaxed elegance.
 &HT;    Guests love amenities such as high-speed Internet access, luxe
bedding, in-room CD players, 24-hour fitness center and quirky
munchie-bar offerings such as candy necklaces and pez dispensers.
 &HT;    Many of the rooms have office facilities, including scanners,
printers and fax machines. Rates start at $239 to $259 per night.
For more information or reservations, call (877) W Hotels.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I have noticed that cruise ships seem to be
getting bigger. We love the features and activities found on big
ships, but we like the intimacy found on smaller ships. Can we have
our cake and eat it too?
 &HT;     A:  It's true that some of the new cruise ships are so huge
that the enjoyment of being ``at sea'' is lost.
 &HT;    Multideck atriums on some ships feel more like airline terminals
and aren't conducive to meaningful conversation. Dining elbow to
elbow with hundreds of shipmates in a cavernous space in the ship's
belly is often little more than a tedious banquet.
 &HT;    Holland America Line seems to have gotten the message, and the
MS Volendam is the first of the company's new generation of luxury
cruise ships. With a passenger capacity of 1,440, the Volendam is
isn't a small vessel, yet its design gives it the intimate feel of
a much smaller ship. Public rooms are plentiful, but each is
creatively distinct in its ambiance.
 &HT;    So cleverly has Holland America crafted the scale of the
Volendam that, combined with its exquisite furnishings, flattering
lighting and $2 million worth of art, passengers have the
impression they are pampered guests on a private yacht.
 &HT;    Those who desire something other than the dramatic two-deck
747-seat Rotterdam Dining Room are free to reserve a private table
at the beautiful 88-seat Marco Polo Restaurant.
 &HT;    While the opportunity to enlarge its already legendary Ocean Spa
and increase the number of its verandah minisuites by 40 percent
were just two of Holland America's persuasive arguments to build a
large ship, the company's commitment to intimate scale and quality
design has retained the romance of cruising.
 &HT;    Economies of scale dictate that ships will get bigger as
passenger demand continues to grow, but the new MS Volendam is an
eloquent example of how small a big ship can be. For more
information, contact your travel professional, or call (877)
SAIL-HAL (724-5425).
 &HT;     Q:  Where can I go to find good travel information on the Web?
 &HT;     A:  Online travel is the largest internet commerce category on
the Web today as more and more browsers discover how easy it is to
plan travel 24 hours a day from the comfort of their homes or
offices.
 &HT;    However, it is important to choose reputable sites that deliver
reliable and worthwhile services to consumers.
 &HT;    Expedia.com is the online travel-industry leader with over $400
million in sales in the last quarter of this year alone. Touches
such as e-mailing customers to inform them of travel delays and
cancellations have helped the company obtain its leading edge.
 &HT;    They also have chosen to offer travel options for a wide variety
of budgets and are committed to finding the best value for your
dollar. However, they operate on the premise that you get what you
pay for. Take a look: www.expedia.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I finally have the opportunity to visit the Amazon rain
forests _ something I have wanted to do my whole life _ but I'm a
little concerned about traveling there alone.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a place where I can really experience the Amazon
without worrying about being taken advantage of or feeling like an
obvious tourist?
 &HT;     A:  Located on the eastern edge of the Andes Mountains in
Ecuador, a small village houses a collection of cabins that should

 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are taking our children to Chicago this
summer. Where do you suggest we take them? As a mom, I'm obligated
to ask for something somewhat educational.
 &HT;     A:  One way to beat the heat is to spend the day at Chicago's
John G. Shedd Aquarium. The aquarium opened its newest exhibit last
month, Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River. Visitors journey
through the annual cycles of the Amazon River basin, which features
over 250 exotic species of animals and explains how they adapt to
the extreme conditions of this ever-changing ecosystem.
 &HT;    Some of the astounding animals your children will see include
the Goliath bird-eating spiders; a green anaconda; and the world's
smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset.
 &HT;    Also, be sure to visit the aquarium's other current exhibits _
the Oceanarium and the Seahorse Symphony. For adults, the aquarium
will be open until 10 p.m. on Thursday nights for Jazzin' at the
Shedd.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Department of State issued a ``Worldwide Caution'' on
June 27, 2000, it was a telling reminder that the world of
terrorism doesn't relax when Americans take their summer vacations.
 &HT;    The caution urged American ``citizens worldwide of the need to
remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. This Public
Announcement is not in response to a particular threat or event but
to emphasize our ongoing concern for the security of Americans
overseas.''
 &HT;    Indeed, unlike past cautions, which have been linked to specific
terrorist events, this one was much broader. Yet it did single out
one date.
 &HT;    ``Periods on or around significant dates, such as the August 7
anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, may be chosen as opportunities
for further terrorist acts. As a result, security continues to be a
prime concern at U.S. government facilities worldwide.''
 &HT;    Anyone heading abroad would do well to visit the Department of
State's Web site, http://travel.state.gov, and have a look at the
Consular Information Sheets, Public Announcements, Travel Warnings.
 &HT;    There's a Consular Information Sheet for every country in the
world. These reports include information on the location of the
U.S. Embassy or Consulate, health conditions, minor political
disturbances, entry regulations as well as crime and security
information.
 &HT;    As the State Department notes, these reports ``generally do not
include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the
traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a
particular country.''
 &HT;    But if there is an area of a given country where there is some
kind of trouble, it's typically listed under a subhead of ``crime''
or ``security.''
 &HT;    Take a country such as Mexico, which draws many Americans.
Currently, that country's Consular Information Sheet states that
``crime in Mexico continues at high levels, and it is increasingly
violent, especially in Mexico City, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Low
apprehension and conviction rates of criminals contribute to the
high crime rate. Other metropolitan areas have lower, but still
serious levels of crime. Travelers should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place, or not bring them at all. All
visitors are encouraged to make use of hotel safes when available,
avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or designer clothing, and
carry only the cash or credit cards that will be needed on each
outing.''
 &HT;    Obviously, much of this is common sense while traveling, but
given the heightened crime, it bears repeating. For the Bahamas,
the State Department says, ``Visitors should store
passport/identity documents, airline tickets, unused credit cards
and extra cash in hotel safes, and avoid wearing expensive jewelry,
particularly Rolex watches, which have been targeted increasingly
by criminals. Visitors should not travel alone on deserted areas of
beaches or poorly-lit areas at night.''
 &HT;    Even Singapore, which is generally considered one of the safest
places in the world, merits advice: ``Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing and purse or briefcase snatching occur in tourist
areas, hotels and at the airport.''
 &HT;    In the same reports, the government also looks at ``Aviation
Safety Oversight.'' Austria, for example, is in ``compliance with
international safety standards,'' as is most of Western Europe. But
Russia is a different story, and the Department of State says,
``Air travel within Russia can at times be unreliable.''
 &HT;    Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides,
``based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
avoid travel to a certain country.'' These countries currently
include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Montserrat,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia-Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tajikistan and Yemen.
 &HT;    These countries are seen as potentially dangerous places for
Americans, and the State Department recommends that Americans avoid
going there.
 &HT;    The Fiji warning, issued on June 28, says, ``The Department of
State urges U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Fiji
because of continued uncertainty and instability resulting from the
ongoing political crisis.''
 &HT;    It goes on to say that U.S. citizens who remain ``should
exercise a high level of caution, avoid demonstrations or public
meetings, maintain adequate stocks of food and water, and monitor
the local radio closely for breaking developments.''
 &HT;    That's hardly a recipe for a nice tropical vacation.
 &HT;    Finally, there are Public Announcements. These are issued for
``terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or
transnational conditions posing significant risks to the security
of American travelers.''
 &HT;    The public announcement for Indonesia and East Timor, issued on
June 1, says, ``all American citizens traveling in these areas
should be aware of their surroundings and use common sense to avoid
situations and locations that could be inherently dangerous.''
 &HT;    Travelers who want a broader perspective can consult the Web
sites of such governments as Great Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada
(www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca) or Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/consular) and
make up their own mind about whether it's really safe to go.
 &HT;    For those without access to the Internet, the Department of
State's ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' and other travel-related documents
can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; (202) 512-1800.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass
prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and
the wind never seems to let up.
 &HT;    Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is
downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers
scatter.
 &HT;    My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last
July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ``red
people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many
American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw.
 &HT;    Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first
capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband,
John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the
town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache,
Western Delaware and Wichita.
 &HT;    Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for
20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825,
when the U.S. government promised it to the Plains Indians and what
were known as the Five Civilized Tribes _ Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek,
Chickasaw, and Seminole _ ``for as long as grass grows and water
runs.''
 &HT;    Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and
spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great
Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.
 &HT;    Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at
intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our
extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of
Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from
Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.
 &HT;    ``When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church,
pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three
miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo
Edringer.
 &HT;    She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a
tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows
in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat
meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish,
listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.
 &HT;    After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden
prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea
and frybread, then led us to the tepees.
 &HT;    ``They're all authentic,'' she said. ``This one is made in the
Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the
packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center,
dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the
side to create a snow break.
 &HT;    The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself
calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in.
 &HT;    ``Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us,
raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the
grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff _ all Indian _
were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged
a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind,
and here it was still.
 &HT;    That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to
a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Redbone is an
Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking
place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones
were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in
the fierce wind at the top of the hill.
 &HT;    Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Redbone's
brother-in-law was ``cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then
the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of
seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed
along each of our faces with a feather fan.
 &HT;    I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept
quietly in one's heart. ``Once we tell you a story it's not ours
anymore,'' he replied.
 &HT;    The Apache lifeway _ an American Indian term for lifestyle _ is
so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings
so that someone, anyone, might remember.
 &HT;    By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town
of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance
was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center.
 &HT;    Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies
painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red
scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great
battle.
 &HT;    The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind
man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that
together they may be rescued. One dancer in the group was a boy of
10 or so, learning by following along.
 &HT;    The next morning _ awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of
birdsong _ we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an
active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the
southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort
Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there
until his death in 1909.
 &HT;    Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner-of-war cemetery under
an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage
site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they
spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and
inaccessible.
 &HT;    Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National
Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the
Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside
the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world
might have looked like while the Indians were still pursuing their
lifeway.
 &HT;    A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer
wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky
Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma
City to the northeast.
 &HT;    The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central
and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend. This part of the state
was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole
after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a
Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the
Mississippi River.
 &HT;    Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they
recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of
Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning
instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress,
which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.
 &HT;    We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the
town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the
Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state
at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40
toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds,
earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.
 &HT;    By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national
historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee
intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ``talking
leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a
result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight.
 &HT;    Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee.
Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee
alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating
English word sounds into Cherokee.
 &HT;    By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk,
which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross
the highway in front of us.
 &HT;    We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had
reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan
Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional
steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By
nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of
silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.
 &HT;    In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds.
The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from
copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the
Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive
center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the
state and all over the world.
 &HT;    Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like
grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us
amused by leaping across the walkway.
 &HT;    The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout
way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a
re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently
didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games
and gaming gear.
 &HT;    From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating
ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the
town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view
out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the
ranch's noisy dogs.
 &HT;    We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again,
where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as
blood.
 &HT;    When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the
vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our
way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the
horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning.
 &HT;    It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee. A brightly colored
circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field
around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it
and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before
reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the
survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly
revered.
 &HT;    The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the
Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ``first nation.''
Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues,
squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken.
 &HT;    The evening progressed through different categories: junior
men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by
ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.
 &HT;    Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search
of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee
or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in
the breeze; an outstretched shawl becomes a butterfly. It is part
of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a
complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.
 &HT;    Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry,
prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths
selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ``Free Leonard Peltier'' pins
and bumper stickers.
 &HT;    Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in
prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing
two FBI agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands
sell Indian tacos and frybread.
 &HT;    Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before
setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took
a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were
welcomed with a genial indifference.
 &HT;    At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an
eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked
four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its
lost power.
 &HT;    Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw
Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside
Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into
the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater.
 &HT;    Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near
the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket
dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the
drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the
singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song.
 &HT;    We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the
circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the
men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never
called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching
headdress.
 &HT;    At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a
ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw
descent. He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw
friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a
second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family
reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By WAYNE CURTIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly
emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these
days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well,
the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland.
 &HT;    Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old
Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture.
The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts
district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's
decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students
after its owners decamped to a mall.
 &HT;    On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders
talking of soaring real-estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who
have started to trickle in.
 &HT;    Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European
trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco
Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer
weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost
everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one
would expect for a city of 65,000.
 &HT;    The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders
have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and
there's growing concern that too much attention will bring
unwelcome change.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air
when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will
converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207)
541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland
festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the
tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of
two 19th-century forts.
 &HT;    Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern
Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay
Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include
fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront,
ship tours and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.
 &HT;    The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21
to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of
Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year
will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in
Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with
costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and
splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.
 &HT;    The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067,
is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of
the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known
for his vivid illustrations of books like ``Treasure Island,'' but
he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from
Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the
paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.
 &HT;    The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207)
761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances
each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon
Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the
accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets
are $10, $5 for children.
 &HT;    The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to
6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers,
artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000
visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach
campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles
north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance,
with discounts for seniors and children.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland
Observatory, 138 Congress St., (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one
of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped
tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of
incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after
a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a
vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.
 &HT;    The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better
appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural
details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead.
 &HT;    The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and
restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial
architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last
great fire swept through the city.
 &HT;    Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State St., (207) 774-5561,
publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for
$1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking
tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a
half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours
is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305
Commercial St., (207) 772-5800.
 &HT;    In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century
neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the
Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth St., (207) 772-4841, one of the
nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture.
Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a
lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is
open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.
 &HT;    Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of
sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands
that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the
17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer
Robert E. Peary.
 &HT;    The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the
island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and
stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours,
Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with
reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.
 &HT;    Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000
Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly
familiar _ it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light
dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first
keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the
site, was built in 1891.
 &HT;    The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public,
but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the
harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The
park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.
 &HT;    On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south
to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by
chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal St., (207)
772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884.
It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with
antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135
to $225, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the
welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth St.; (207) 879-8755, fax (207)
879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former
servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1
has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have
access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to
$285, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine St., (207) 871-7638, fax (207)
775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West
End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early
Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those
facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious
than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with
breakfast.
 &HT;    The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring St., (800) 437-8511 or (207)
774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the
art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city
restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black
Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800)
258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century
buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean.
 &HT;    Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest
rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are
generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style.
Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged
elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at
picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.
 &HT;    Natasha's, 40 Portland St., (207) 774-4004, features new
American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that
features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork
loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab.
Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch.
Dinner for two with wine, about $60.
 &HT;    At Ribollita, 41 Middle St., (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the
chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other
Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with
white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter,
and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for
dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about
$70.
 &HT;    Bella Cucina, 653 Congress St., (207) 828-4033, combines
romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow
tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves
up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options.
 &HT;    The menu changes according to availability of ingredients;
expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a
parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served
over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for
two, with wine.
 &HT;    The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High St., (207)
774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate
specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly
good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion
wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing
martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open
nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis:
$75.
 &HT;    Silly's, 40 Washington Ave., (207) 772-0360, will satisfy
aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger
food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular,
as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut
fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the
customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15
to $20 for two.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MELANIE REHAK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the
start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments,
leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate
around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen.
 &HT;    These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my
excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic:
camping.
 &HT;    The idea of sleeping under the stars _ even seeing the stars _
epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that
the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze,
and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.
 &HT;    Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in
New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant
attributes of outdoor life _ the crackle of the fire, the sound of
the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite _ came some
rather difficult logistics.
 &HT;    Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles
had to be put together piece by piece by piece _ an endless
process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded
me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds.
 &HT;    The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no
matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and
twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting
marshmallows on fire.
 &HT;    Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched
innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully
portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a
benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!).
 &HT;    I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded
discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off
the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook
(after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not
dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and
ate scores of hot dogs.
 &HT;    As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I
finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it
had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror
intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion
was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to
camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
 &HT;    Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in
search of a tent _ and got something of a shock. Navigating the
outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed
very far away.
 &HT;    Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing
through the L.L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even five
years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site
of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear
store.
 &HT;    Then I found the link to the REI Outlet Web site,
(www.rei-outlet.com) designed for _ not to mention directed at _
people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical
prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.
 &HT;    Within minutes, I had located the perfect tent for the perfect
price ($52.95). It was made of hunter-green nylon, and had
fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the
front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I
couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it
was mine.
 &HT;    Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time
cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered
on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without.
Most of it was stuff I'd never heard of.
 &HT;    There were ``hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from
built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30
styles of hiking shoes _ for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes,
summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in
10 styles. There were water-filtration systems, gourmet cook sets,
even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.
 &HT;    While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable _
for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not
absorb water _ a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need
microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping
trip? Yet they were tempting.
 &HT;    True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like
hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire.
But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that
certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a
headlamp and a two-way radio _ just in case someone gets lost
looking for the water tap.
 &HT;    I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner
of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.
 &HT;    When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We
pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for
battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles
and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five
minutes.
 &HT;    Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up
the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to
do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that
was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had
arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell
asleep on my air mattress.
 &HT;    A few hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of
collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a
gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was
going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore,
had we remembered bug spray?
 &HT;    In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I
remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well
up.
 &HT;    I found this oddly comforting _ all the high-tech efficiency was
getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans
cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with
s'mores and then it was time for bed.
 &HT;    The trip to the wash house wasn't bad _ we walked along the path
with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in
against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and
insects.
 &HT;    Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and
wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my
sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises
outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had
scanned on the REI site, ``Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food
Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to
the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go
back to sleep.
 &HT;    I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and
ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would
he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me?
 &HT;    My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered
front flap grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was
absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.
 &HT;    Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen
flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all,
cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and
because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my
sneakers were squishy with dew.
 &HT;    The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the
unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the
night, was still great.

our cake and eat it too?
 &HT;     A:  It's true that some of the new cruise ships are so huge
that the enjoyment of being ``at sea'' is lost.
 &HT;    Multideck atriums on some ships feel more like airline terminals
and aren't conducive to meaningful conversation. Dining elbow to
elbow with hundreds of shipmates in a cavernous space in the ship's
belly is often little more than a tedious banquet.
 &HT;    Holland America Line seems to have gotten the message, and the
MS Volendam is the first of the company's new generation of luxury
cruise ships. With a passenger capacity of 1,440, the Volendam is
isn't a small vessel, yet its design gives it the intimate feel of
a much smaller ship. Public rooms are plentiful, but each is
creatively distinct in its ambiance.
 &HT;    So cleverly has Holland America crafted the scale of the
Volendam that, combined with its exquisite furnishings, flattering
lighting and $2 million worth of art, passengers have the
impression they are pampered guests on a private yacht.
 &HT;    Those who desire something other than the dramatic two-deck
747-seat Rotterdam Dining Room are free to reserve a private table
at the beautiful 88-seat Marco Polo Restaurant.
 &HT;    While the opportunity to enlarge its already legendary Ocean Spa
and increase the number of its verandah minisuites by 40 percent
were just two of Holland America's persuasive arguments to build a
large ship, the company's commitment to intimate scale and quality
design has retained the romance of cruising.
 &HT;    Economies of scale dictate that ships will get bigger as
passenger demand continues to grow, but the new MS Volendam is an
eloquent example of how small a big ship can be. For more
information, contact your travel professional, or call (877)
SAIL-HAL (724-5425).
 &HT;     Q:  Where can I go to find good travel information on the Web?
 &HT;     A:  Online travel is the largest internet commerce category on
the Web today as more and more browsers discover how easy it is to
plan travel 24 hours a day from the comfort of their homes or
offices.
 &HT;    However, it is important to choose reputable sites that deliver
reliable and worthwhile services to consumers.
 &HT;    Expedia.com is the online travel-industry leader with over $400
million in sales in the last quarter of this year alone. Touches
such as e-mailing customers to inform them of travel delays and
cancellations have helped the company obtain its leading edge.
 &HT;    They also have chosen to offer travel options for a wide variety
of budgets and are committed to finding the best value for your
dollar. However, they operate on the premise that you get what you
pay for. Take a look: www.expedia.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I finally have the opportunity to visit the Amazon rain
forests _ something I have wanted to do my whole life _ but I'm a
little concerned about traveling there alone.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a place where I can really experience the Amazon
without worrying about being taken advantage of or feeling like an
obvious tourist?
 &HT;     A:  Located on the eastern edge of the Andes Mountains in
Ecuador, a small village houses a collection of cabins that should
suit your needs.
 &HT;    Operated by Beny Ammeter, a Swiss expatriate, La Casa del Suizo
is a small group of cabins that overlooks the Napo River and the
expansive rain forest.
 &HT;    Guests are immediately plunged into the Quichua Indian culture
as soon as they arrive at the resort _ by canoe _ and visit the
village to mingle with the locals; watch blowpipe demonstrations;
learn to make the local alcoholic drink, chicha; and hike through
the awe-inspiring rain forest.
 &HT;    For more infomation, visit www.casadelsuizo.com on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip, and more like it, can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are taking our children to Chicago this
summer. Where do you suggest we take them? As a mom, I'm obligated
to ask for something somewhat educational.
 &HT;     A:  One way to beat the heat is to spend the day at Chicago's
John G. Shedd Aquarium. The aquarium opened its newest exhibit last
month, Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River. Visitors journey
through the annual cycles of the Amazon River basin, which features
over 250 exotic species of animals and explains how they adapt to
the extreme conditions of this ever-changing ecosystem.
 &HT;    Some of the astounding animals your children will see include
the Goliath bird-eating spiders; a green anaconda; and the world's
smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset.
 &HT;    Also, be sure to visit the aquarium's other current exhibits _
the Oceanarium and the Seahorse Symphony. For adults, the aquarium
will be open until 10 p.m. on Thursday nights for Jazzin' at the
Shedd.
 &HT;    For more information, call (312) 939-2438, or visit
www.sheddaquarium.org. Advance tickets are available through
Ticketmaster at (312) 559-0200.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Department of State issued a ``Worldwide Caution'' on
June 27, 2000, it was a telling reminder that the world of
terrorism doesn't relax when Americans take their summer vacations.
 &HT;    The caution urged American ``citizens worldwide of the need to
remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. This Public
Announcement is not in response to a particular threat or event but
to emphasize our ongoing concern for the security of Americans
overseas.''
 &HT;    Indeed, unlike past cautions, which have been linked to specific
terrorist events, this one was much broader. Yet it did single out
one date.
 &HT;    ``Periods on or around significant dates, such as the August 7
anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, may be chosen as opportunities
for further terrorist acts. As a result, security continues to be a
prime concern at U.S. government facilities worldwide.''
 &HT;    Anyone heading abroad would do well to visit the Department of
State's Web site, http://travel.state.gov, and have a look at the
Consular Information Sheets, Public Announcements, Travel Warnings.
 &HT;    There's a Consular Information Sheet for every country in the
world. These reports include information on the location of the
U.S. Embassy or Consulate, health conditions, minor political
disturbances, entry regulations as well as crime and security
information.
 &HT;    As the State Department notes, these reports ``generally do not
include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the
traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a
particular country.''
 &HT;    But if there is an area of a given country where there is some
kind of trouble, it's typically listed under a subhead of ``crime''
or ``security.''
 &HT;    Take a country such as Mexico, which draws many Americans.
Currently, that country's Consular Information Sheet states that
``crime in Mexico continues at high levels, and it is increasingly
violent, especially in Mexico City, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Low
apprehension and conviction rates of criminals contribute to the
high crime rate. Other metropolitan areas have lower, but still
serious levels of crime. Travelers should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place, or not bring them at all. All
visitors are encouraged to make use of hotel safes when available,
avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or designer clothing, and
carry only the cash or credit cards that will be needed on each
outing.''
 &HT;    Obviously, much of this is common sense while traveling, but
given the heightened crime, it bears repeating. For the Bahamas,
the State Department says, ``Visitors should store
passport/identity documents, airline tickets, unused credit cards
and extra cash in hotel safes, and avoid wearing expensive jewelry,
particularly Rolex watches, which have been targeted increasingly
by criminals. Visitors should not travel alone on deserted areas of
beaches or poorly-lit areas at night.''
 &HT;    Even Singapore, which is generally considered one of the safest
places in the world, merits advice: ``Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing and purse or briefcase snatching occur in tourist
areas, hotels and at the airport.''
 &HT;    In the same reports, the government also looks at ``Aviation
Safety Oversight.'' Austria, for example, is in ``compliance with
international safety standards,'' as is most of Western Europe. But
Russia is a different story, and the Department of State says,
``Air travel within Russia can at times be unreliable.''
 &HT;    Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides,
``based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
avoid travel to a certain country.'' These countries currently
include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Montserrat,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia-Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tajikistan and Yemen.
 &HT;    These countries are seen as potentially dangerous places for
Americans, and the State Department recommends that Americans avoid
going there.
 &HT;    The Fiji warning, issued on June 28, says, ``The Department of
State urges U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Fiji
because of continued uncertainty and instability resulting from the
ongoing political crisis.''
 &HT;    It goes on to say that U.S. citizens who remain ``should
exercise a high level of caution, avoid demonstrations or public
meetings, maintain adequate stocks of food and water, and monitor
the local radio closely for breaking developments.''
 &HT;    That's hardly a recipe for a nice tropical vacation.
 &HT;    Finally, there are Public Announcements. These are issued for
``terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or
transnational conditions posing significant risks to the security
of American travelers.''
 &HT;    The public announcement for Indonesia and East Timor, issued on
June 1, says, ``all American citizens traveling in these areas
should be aware of their surroundings and use common sense to avoid
situations and locations that could be inherently dangerous.''
 &HT;    Travelers who want a broader perspective can consult the Web
sites of such governments as Great Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada
(www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca) or Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/consular) and
make up their own mind about whether it's really safe to go.
 &HT;    For those without access to the Internet, the Department of
State's ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' and other travel-related documents
can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; (202) 512-1800.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass
prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and
the wind never seems to let up.
 &HT;    Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is
downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers
scatter.
 &HT;    My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last
July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ``red
people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many
American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw.
 &HT;    Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first
capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband,
John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the
town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache,
Western Delaware and Wichita.
 &HT;    Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for
20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825,
when the U.S. government promised it to the Plains Indians and what
were known as the Five Civilized Tribes _ Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek,
Chickasaw, and Seminole _ ``for as long as grass grows and water
runs.''
 &HT;    Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and
spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great
Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.
 &HT;    Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at
intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our
extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of
Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from
Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.
 &HT;    ``When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church,
pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three
miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo
Edringer.
 &HT;    She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a
tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows
in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat
meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish,
listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.
 &HT;    After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden
prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea
and frybread, then led us to the tepees.
 &HT;    ``They're all authentic,'' she said. ``This one is made in the
Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the
packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center,
dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the
side to create a snow break.
 &HT;    The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself
calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in.
 &HT;    ``Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us,
raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the
grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff _ all Indian _
were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged
a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind,
and here it was still.
 &HT;    That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to
a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Redbone is an
Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking
place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones
were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in
the fierce wind at the top of the hill.
 &HT;    Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Redbone's
brother-in-law was ``cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then
the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of
seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed
along each of our faces with a feather fan.
 &HT;    I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept
quietly in one's heart. ``Once we tell you a story it's not ours
anymore,'' he replied.
 &HT;    The Apache lifeway _ an American Indian term for lifestyle _ is
so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings
so that someone, anyone, might remember.
 &HT;    By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town
of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance
was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center.
 &HT;    Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies
painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red
scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great
battle.
 &HT;    The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind
man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that
together they may be rescued. One dancer in the group was a boy of
10 or so, learning by following along.
 &HT;    The next morning _ awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of
birdsong _ we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an
active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the
southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort
Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there
until his death in 1909.
 &HT;    Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner-of-war cemetery under
an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage
site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they
spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and
inaccessible.
 &HT;    Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National
Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the
Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside
the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world
might have looked like while the Indians were still pursuing their
lifeway.
 &HT;    A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer
wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky
Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma
City to the northeast.
 &HT;    The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central
and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend. This part of the state
was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole
after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a
Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the
Mississippi River.
 &HT;    Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they
recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of
Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning
instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress,
which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.
 &HT;    We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the
town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the
Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state
at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40
toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds,
earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.
 &HT;    By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national
historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee
intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ``talking
leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a
result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight.
 &HT;    Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee.
Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee
alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating
English word sounds into Cherokee.
 &HT;    By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk,
which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross
the highway in front of us.
 &HT;    We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had
reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan
Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional
steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By
nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of
silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.
 &HT;    In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds.
The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from
copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the
Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive
center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the
state and all over the world.
 &HT;    Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like
grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us
amused by leaping across the walkway.
 &HT;    The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout
way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a
re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently
didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games
and gaming gear.
 &HT;    From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating
ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the
town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view
out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the
ranch's noisy dogs.
 &HT;    We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again,
where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as
blood.
 &HT;    When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the
vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our
way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the
horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning.
 &HT;    It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee. A brightly colored
circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field
around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it
and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before
reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the
survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly
revered.
 &HT;    The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the
Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ``first nation.''
Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues,
squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken.
 &HT;    The evening progressed through different categories: junior
men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by
ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.
 &HT;    Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search
of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee
or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in
the breeze; an outstretched shawl becomes a butterfly. It is part
of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a
complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.
 &HT;    Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry,
prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths
selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ``Free Leonard Peltier'' pins
and bumper stickers.
 &HT;    Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in
prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing
two FBI agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands
sell Indian tacos and frybread.
 &HT;    Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before
setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took
a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were
welcomed with a genial indifference.
 &HT;    At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an
eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked
four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its
lost power.
 &HT;    Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw
Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside
Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into
the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater.
 &HT;    Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near
the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket
dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the
drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the
singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song.
 &HT;    We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the
circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the
men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never
called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching
headdress.
 &HT;    At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a
ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw
descent. He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw
friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a
second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family
reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By WAYNE CURTIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly
emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these
days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well,
the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland.
 &HT;    Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old
Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture.
The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts
district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's
decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students
after its owners decamped to a mall.
 &HT;    On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders
talking of soaring real-estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who
have started to trickle in.
 &HT;    Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European
trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco
Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer
weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost
everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one
would expect for a city of 65,000.
 &HT;    The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders
have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and
there's growing concern that too much attention will bring
unwelcome change.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air
when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will
converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207)
541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland
festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the
tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of
two 19th-century forts.
 &HT;    Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern
Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay
Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include
fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront,
ship tours and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.
 &HT;    The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21
to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of
Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year
will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in
Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with
costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and
splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.
 &HT;    The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067,
is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of
the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known
for his vivid illustrations of books like ``Treasure Island,'' but
he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from
Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the
paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.
 &HT;    The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207)
761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances
each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon
Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the
accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets
are $10, $5 for children.
 &HT;    The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to
6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers,
artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000
visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach
campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles
north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance,
with discounts for seniors and children.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland
Observatory, 138 Congress St., (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one
of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped
tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of
incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after
a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a
vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.
 &HT;    The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better
appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural
details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead.
 &HT;    The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and
restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial
architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last
great fire swept through the city.
 &HT;    Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State St., (207) 774-5561,
publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for
$1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking
tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a
half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours
is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305
Commercial St., (207) 772-5800.
 &HT;    In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century
neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the
Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth St., (207) 772-4841, one of the
nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture.
Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a
lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is
open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.
 &HT;    Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of
sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands
that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the
17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer
Robert E. Peary.
 &HT;    The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the
island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and
stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours,
Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with
reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.
 &HT;    Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000
Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly
familiar _ it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light
dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first
keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the
site, was built in 1891.
 &HT;    The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public,
but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the
harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The
park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.
 &HT;    On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south
to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by
chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal St., (207)
772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884.
It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with
antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135
to $225, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the
welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth St.; (207) 879-8755, fax (207)
879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former
servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1
has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have
access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to
$285, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine St., (207) 871-7638, fax (207)
775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West
End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early
Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those
facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious
than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with
breakfast.
 &HT;    The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring St., (800) 437-8511 or (207)
774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the
art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city
restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black
Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800)
258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century
buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean.
 &HT;    Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest
rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are
generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style.
Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged
elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at
picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.
 &HT;    Natasha's, 40 Portland St., (207) 774-4004, features new
American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that
features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork
loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab.
Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch.
Dinner for two with wine, about $60.
 &HT;    At Ribollita, 41 Middle St., (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the
chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other
Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with
white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter,
and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for
dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about
$70.
 &HT;    Bella Cucina, 653 Congress St., (207) 828-4033, combines
romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow
tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves
up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options.
 &HT;    The menu changes according to availability of ingredients;
expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a
parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served
over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for
two, with wine.
 &HT;    The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High St., (207)
774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate
specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly
good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion
wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing
martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open
nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis:
$75.
 &HT;    Silly's, 40 Washington Ave., (207) 772-0360, will satisfy
aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger
food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular,
as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut
fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the
customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15
to $20 for two.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MELANIE REHAK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the
start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments,
leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate
around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen.
 &HT;    These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my
excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic:
camping.
 &HT;    The idea of sleeping under the stars _ even seeing the stars _
epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that
the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze,
and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.
 &HT;    Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in
New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant
attributes of outdoor life _ the crackle of the fire, the sound of
the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite _ came some
rather difficult logistics.
 &HT;    Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles
had to be put together piece by piece by piece _ an endless
process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded
me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds.
 &HT;    The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no
matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and
twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting
marshmallows on fire.
 &HT;    Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched
innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully
portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a
benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!).
 &HT;    I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded
discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off
the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook
(after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not
dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and
ate scores of hot dogs.
 &HT;    As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I
finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it
had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror
intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion
was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to
camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
 &HT;    Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in
search of a tent _ and got something of a shock. Navigating the
outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed
very far away.
 &HT;    Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing
through the L.L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even five
years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site
of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear
store.
 &HT;    Then I found the link to the REI Outlet Web site,
(www.rei-outlet.com) designed for _ not to mention directed at _
people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical
prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.
 &HT;    Within minutes, I had located the perfect tent for the perfect
price ($52.95). It was made of hunter-green nylon, and had
fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the
front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I
couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it
was mine.
 &HT;    Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time
cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered
on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without.
Most of it was stuff I'd never heard of.
 &HT;    There were ``hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from
built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30
styles of hiking shoes _ for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes,
summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in
10 styles. There were water-filtration systems, gourmet cook sets,
even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.
 &HT;    While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable _
for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not
absorb water _ a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need
microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping
trip? Yet they were tempting.
 &HT;    True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like
hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire.
But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that
certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a
headlamp and a two-way radio _ just in case someone gets lost
looking for the water tap.
 &HT;    I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner
of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.
 &HT;    When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We
pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for
battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles
and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five
minutes.
 &HT;    Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up
the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to
do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that
was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had
arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell
asleep on my air mattress.
 &HT;    A few hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of
collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a
gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was
going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore,
had we remembered bug spray?
 &HT;    In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I
remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well
up.
 &HT;    I found this oddly comforting _ all the high-tech efficiency was
getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans
cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with
s'mores and then it was time for bed.
 &HT;    The trip to the wash house wasn't bad _ we walked along the path
with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in
against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and
insects.
 &HT;    Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and
wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my
sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises
outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had
scanned on the REI site, ``Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food
Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to
the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go
back to sleep.
 &HT;    I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and
ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would
he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me?
 &HT;    My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered
front flap grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was
absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.
 &HT;    Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen
flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all,
cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and
because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my
sneakers were squishy with dew.
 &HT;    The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the
unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the
night, was still great.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I'm looking for a sleek and modern hotel in the heart of
Seattle. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Plush chenille pillows, intimate lighting and an impressive
24-hour concierge service are just a handful of the special touches
that guests can expect at the new W Hotel in Seattle.
 &HT;    Part of the brand-driven W hotel chain launched by Starwood
Hotels and Resorts, the W Seattle is a unique refuge for business
and leisure travelers who have a penchant for hip hotels that
combine sophisticated urban style with relaxed elegance.
 &HT;    Guests love amenities such as high-speed Internet access, luxe
bedding, in-room CD players, 24-hour fitness center and quirky
munchie-bar offerings such as candy necklaces and pez dispensers.
 &HT;    Many of the rooms have office facilities, including scanners,
printers and fax machines. Rates start at $239 to $259 per night.
For more information or reservations, call (877) W Hotels.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I have noticed that cruise ships seem to be
getting bigger. We love the features and activities found on big
ships, but we like the intimacy found on smaller ships. Can we have
our cake and eat it too?
 &HT;     A:  It's true that some of the new cruise ships are so huge
that the enjoyment of being ``at sea'' is lost.
 &HT;    Multideck atriums on some ships feel more like airline terminals
and aren't conducive to meaningful conversation. Dining elbow to
elbow with hundreds of shipmates in a cavernous space in the ship's
belly is often little more than a tedious banquet.
 &HT;    Holland America Line seems to have gotten the message, and the
MS Volendam is the first of the company's new generation of luxury
cruise ships. With a passenger capacity of 1,440, the Volendam is
isn't a small vessel, yet its design gives it the intimate feel of
a much smaller ship. Public rooms are plentiful, but each is
creatively distinct in its ambiance.
 &HT;    So cleverly has Holland America crafted the scale of the
Volendam that, combined with its exquisite furnishings, flattering
lighting and $2 million worth of art, passengers have the
impression they are pampered guests on a private yacht.
 &HT;    Those who desire something other than the dramatic two-deck
747-seat Rotterdam Dining Room are free to reserve a private table
at the beautiful 88-seat Marco Polo Restaurant.
 &HT;    While the opportunity to enlarge its already legendary Ocean Spa
and increase the number of its verandah minisuites by 40 percent
were just two of Holland America's persuasive arguments to build a
large ship, the company's commitment to intimate scale and quality
design has retained the romance of cruising.
 &HT;    Economies of scale dictate that ships will get bigger as
passenger demand continues to grow, but the new MS Volendam is an
eloquent example of how small a big ship can be. For more
information, contact your travel professional, or call (877)
SAIL-HAL (724-5425).
 &HT;     Q:  Where can I go to find good travel information on the Web?
 &HT;     A:  Online travel is the largest internet commerce category on
the Web today as more and more browsers discover how easy it is to
plan travel 24 hours a day from the comfort of their homes or
offices.
 &HT;    However, it is important to choose reputable sites that deliver
reliable and worthwhile services to consumers.
 &HT;    Expedia.com is the online travel-industry leader with over $400
million in sales in the last quarter of this year alone. Touches
such as e-mailing customers to inform them of travel delays and
cancellations have helped the company obtain its leading edge.
 &HT;    They also have chosen to offer travel options for a wide variety
of budgets and are committed to finding the best value for your
dollar. However, they operate on the premise that you get what you
pay for. Take a look: www.expedia.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I finally have the opportunity to visit the Amazon rain
forests _ something I have wanted to do my whole life _ but I'm a
little concerned about traveling there alone.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a place where I can really experience the Amazon
without worrying about being taken advantage of or feeling like an
obvious tourist?
 &HT;     A:  Located on the eastern edge of the Andes Mountains in
Ecuador, a small village houses a collection of cabins that should
suit your needs.
 &HT;    Operated by Beny Ammeter, a Swiss expatriate, La Casa del Suizo
is a small group of cabins that overlooks the Napo River and the
expansive rain forest.
 &HT;    Guests are immediately plunged into the Quichua Indian culture
as soon as they arrive at the resort _ by canoe _ and visit the
village to mingle with the locals; watch blowpipe demonstrations;
learn to make the local alcoholic drink, chicha; and hike through
the awe-inspiring rain forest.
 &HT;    For more infomation, visit www.casadelsuizo.com on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip, and more like it, can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are taking our children to Chicago this
summer. Where do you suggest we take them? As a mom, I'm obligated
to ask for something somewhat educational.
 &HT;     A:  One way to beat the heat is to spend the day at Chicago's
John G. Shedd Aquarium. The aquarium opened its newest exhibit last
month, Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River. Visitors journey
through the annual cycles of the Amazon River basin, which features
over 250 exotic species of animals and explains how they adapt to
the extreme conditions of this ever-changing ecosystem.
 &HT;    Some of the astounding animals your children will see include
the Goliath bird-eating spiders; a green anaconda; and the world's
smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset.
 &HT;    Also, be sure to visit the aquarium's other current exhibits _
the Oceanarium and the Seahorse Symphony. For adults, the aquarium
will be open until 10 p.m. on Thursday nights for Jazzin' at the
Shedd.
 &HT;    For more information, call (312) 939-2438, or visit
www.sheddaquarium.org. Advance tickets are available through
Ticketmaster at (312) 559-0200.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Department of State issued a ``Worldwide Caution'' on
June 27, 2000, it was a telling reminder that the world of
terrorism doesn't relax when Americans take their summer vacations.
 &HT;    The caution urged American ``citizens worldwide of the need to
remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. This Public
Announcement is not in response to a particular threat or event but
to emphasize our ongoing concern for the security of Americans
overseas.''
 &HT;    Indeed, unlike past cautions, which have been linked to specific
terrorist events, this one was much broader. Yet it did single out
one date.
 &HT;    ``Periods on or around significant dates, such as the August 7
anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, may be chosen as opportunities
for further terrorist acts. As a result, security continues to be a
prime concern at U.S. government facilities worldwide.''
 &HT;    Anyone heading abroad would do well to visit the Department of
State's Web site, http://travel.state.gov, and have a look at the
Consular Information Sheets, Public Announcements, Travel Warnings.
 &HT;    There's a Consular Information Sheet for every country in the
world. These reports include information on the location of the
U.S. Embassy or Consulate, health conditions, minor political
disturbances, entry regulations as well as crime and security
information.
 &HT;    As the State Department notes, these reports ``generally do not
include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the
traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a
particular country.''
 &HT;    But if there is an area of a given country where there is some
kind of trouble, it's typically listed under a subhead of ``crime''
or ``security.''
 &HT;    Take a country such as Mexico, which draws many Americans.
Currently, that country's Consular Information Sheet states that
``crime in Mexico continues at high levels, and it is increasingly
violent, especially in Mexico City, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Low
apprehension and conviction rates of criminals contribute to the
high crime rate. Other metropolitan areas have lower, but still
serious levels of crime. Travelers should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place, or not bring them at all. All
visitors are encouraged to make use of hotel safes when available,
avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or designer clothing, and
carry only the cash or credit cards that will be needed on each
outing.''
 &HT;    Obviously, much of this is common sense while traveling, but
given the heightened crime, it bears repeating. For the Bahamas,
the State Department says, ``Visitors should store
passport/identity documents, airline tickets, unused credit cards
and extra cash in hotel safes, and avoid wearing expensive jewelry,
particularly Rolex watches, which have been targeted increasingly
by criminals. Visitors should not travel alone on deserted areas of
beaches or poorly-lit areas at night.''
 &HT;    Even Singapore, which is generally considered one of the safest
places in the world, merits advice: ``Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing and purse or briefcase snatching occur in tourist
areas, hotels and at the airport.''
 &HT;    In the same reports, the government also looks at ``Aviation
Safety Oversight.'' Austria, for example, is in ``compliance with
international safety standards,'' as is most of Western Europe. But
Russia is a different story, and the Department of State says,
``Air travel within Russia can at times be unreliable.''
 &HT;    Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides,
``based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
avoid travel to a certain country.'' These countries currently
include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Montserrat,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia-Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tajikistan and Yemen.
 &HT;    These countries are seen as potentially dangerous places for
Americans, and the State Department recommends that Americans avoid
going there.
 &HT;    The Fiji warning, issued on June 28, says, ``The Department of
State urges U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Fiji
because of continued uncertainty and instability resulting from the
ongoing political crisis.''
 &HT;    It goes on to say that U.S. citizens who remain ``should
exercise a high level of caution, avoid demonstrations or public
meetings, maintain adequate stocks of food and water, and monitor
the local radio closely for breaking developments.''
 &HT;    That's hardly a recipe for a nice tropical vacation.
 &HT;    Finally, there are Public Announcements. These are issued for
``terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or
transnational conditions posing significant risks to the security
of American travelers.''
 &HT;    The public announcement for Indonesia and East Timor, issued on
June 1, says, ``all American citizens traveling in these areas
should be aware of their surroundings and use common sense to avoid
situations and locations that could be inherently dangerous.''
 &HT;    Travelers who want a broader perspective can consult the Web
sites of such governments as Great Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada
(www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca) or Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/consular) and
make up their own mind about whether it's really safe to go.
 &HT;    For those without access to the Internet, the Department of
State's ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' and other travel-related documents
can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; (202) 512-1800.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass
prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and
the wind never seems to let up.
 &HT;    Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is
downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers
scatter.
 &HT;    My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last
July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ``red
people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many
American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw.
 &HT;    Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first
capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband,
John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the
town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache,
Western Delaware and Wichita.
 &HT;    Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for
20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825,
when the U.S. government promised it to the Plains Indians and what
were known as the Five Civilized Tribes _ Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek,
Chickasaw, and Seminole _ ``for as long as grass grows and water
runs.''
 &HT;    Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and
spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great
Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.
 &HT;    Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at
intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our
extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of
Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from
Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.
 &HT;    ``When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church,
pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three
miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo
Edringer.
 &HT;    She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a
tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows
in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat
meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish,
listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.
 &HT;    After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden
prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea
and frybread, then led us to the tepees.
 &HT;    ``They're all authentic,'' she said. ``This one is made in the
Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the
packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center,
dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the
side to create a snow break.
 &HT;    The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself
calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in.
 &HT;    ``Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us,
raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the
grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff _ all Indian _
were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged
a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind,
and here it was still.
 &HT;    That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to
a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Redbone is an
Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking
place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones
were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in
the fierce wind at the top of the hill.
 &HT;    Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Redbone's
brother-in-law was ``cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then
the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of
seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed
along each of our faces with a feather fan.
 &HT;    I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept
quietly in one's heart. ``Once we tell you a story it's not ours
anymore,'' he replied.
 &HT;    The Apache lifeway _ an American Indian term for lifestyle _ is
so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings
so that someone, anyone, might remember.
 &HT;    By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town
of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance
was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center.
 &HT;    Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies
painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red
scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great
battle.
 &HT;    The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind
man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that
together they may be rescued. One dancer in the group was a boy of
10 or so, learning by following along.
 &HT;    The next morning _ awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of
birdsong _ we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an
active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the
southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort
Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there
until his death in 1909.
 &HT;    Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner-of-war cemetery under
an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage
site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they
spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and
inaccessible.
 &HT;    Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National
Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the
Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside
the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world
might have looked like while the Indians were still pursuing their
lifeway.
 &HT;    A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer
wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky
Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma
City to the northeast.
 &HT;    The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central
and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend. This part of the state
was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole
after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a
Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the
Mississippi River.
 &HT;    Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they
recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of
Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning
instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress,
which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.
 &HT;    We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the
town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the
Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state
at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40
toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds,
earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.
 &HT;    By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national
historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee
intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ``talking
leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a
result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight.
 &HT;    Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee.
Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee
alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating
English word sounds into Cherokee.
 &HT;    By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk,
which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross
the highway in front of us.
 &HT;    We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had
reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan
Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional
steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By
nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of
silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.
 &HT;    In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds.
The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from
copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the
Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive
center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the
state and all over the world.
 &HT;    Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like
grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us
amused by leaping across the walkway.
 &HT;    The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout
way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a
re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently
didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games
and gaming gear.
 &HT;    From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating
ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the
town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view
out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the
ranch's noisy dogs.
 &HT;    We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again,
where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as
blood.
 &HT;    When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the
vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our
way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the
horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning.
 &HT;    It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee. A brightly colored
circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field
around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it
and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before
reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the
survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly
revered.
 &HT;    The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the
Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ``first nation.''
Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues,
squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken.
 &HT;    The evening progressed through different categories: junior
men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by
ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.
 &HT;    Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search
of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee
or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in
the breeze; an outstretched shawl becomes a butterfly. It is part
of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a
complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.
 &HT;    Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry,
prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths
selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ``Free Leonard Peltier'' pins
and bumper stickers.
 &HT;    Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in
prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing
two FBI agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands
sell Indian tacos and frybread.
 &HT;    Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before
setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took
a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were
welcomed with a genial indifference.
 &HT;    At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an
eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked
four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its
lost power.
 &HT;    Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw
Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside
Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into
the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater.
 &HT;    Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near
the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket
dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the
drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the
singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song.
 &HT;    We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the
circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the
men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never
called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching
headdress.
 &HT;    At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a
ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw
descent. He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw
friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a
second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family
reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By WAYNE CURTIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly
emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these
days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well,
the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland.
 &HT;    Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old
Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture.
The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts
district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's
decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students
after its owners decamped to a mall.
 &HT;    On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders
talking of soaring real-estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who
have started to trickle in.
 &HT;    Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European
trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco
Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer
weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost
everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one
would expect for a city of 65,000.
 &HT;    The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders
have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and
there's growing concern that too much attention will bring
unwelcome change.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air
when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will
converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207)
541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland
festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the
tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of
two 19th-century forts.
 &HT;    Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern
Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay
Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include
fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront,
ship tours and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.
 &HT;    The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21
to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of
Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year
will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in
Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with
costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and
splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.
 &HT;    The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067,
is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of
the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known
for his vivid illustrations of books like ``Treasure Island,'' but
he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from
Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the
paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.
 &HT;    The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207)
761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances
each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon
Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the
accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets
are $10, $5 for children.
 &HT;    The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to
6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers,
artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000
visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach
campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles
north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance,
with discounts for seniors and children.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland
Observatory, 138 Congress St., (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one
of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped
tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of
incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after
a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a
vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.
 &HT;    The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better
appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural
details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead.
 &HT;    The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and
restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial
architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last
great fire swept through the city.
 &HT;    Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State St., (207) 774-5561,
publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for
$1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking
tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a
half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours
is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305
Commercial St., (207) 772-5800.
 &HT;    In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century
neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the
Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth St., (207) 772-4841, one of the
nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture.
Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a
lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is
open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.
 &HT;    Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of
sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands
that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the
17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer
Robert E. Peary.
 &HT;    The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the
island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and
stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours,
Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with
reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.
 &HT;    Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000
Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly
familiar _ it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light
dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first
keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the
site, was built in 1891.
 &HT;    The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public,
but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the
harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The
park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.
 &HT;    On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south
to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by
chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal St., (207)
772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884.
It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with
antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135
to $225, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the
welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth St.; (207) 879-8755, fax (207)
879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former
servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1
has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have
access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to
$285, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine St., (207) 871-7638, fax (207)
775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West
End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early
Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those
facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious
than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with
breakfast.
 &HT;    The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring St., (800) 437-8511 or (207)
774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the
art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city
restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black
Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800)
258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century
buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean.
 &HT;    Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest
rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are
generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style.
Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged
elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at
picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.
 &HT;    Natasha's, 40 Portland St., (207) 774-4004, features new
American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that
features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork
loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab.
Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch.
Dinner for two with wine, about $60.
 &HT;    At Ribollita, 41 Middle St., (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the
chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other
Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with
white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter,
and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for
dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about
$70.
 &HT;    Bella Cucina, 653 Congress St., (207) 828-4033, combines
romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow
tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves
up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options.
 &HT;    The menu changes according to availability of ingredients;
expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a
parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served
over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for
two, with wine.
 &HT;    The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High St., (207)
774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate
specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly
good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion
wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing
martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open
nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis:
$75.
 &HT;    Silly's, 40 Washington Ave., (207) 772-0360, will satisfy
aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger
food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular,
as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut
fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the
customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15
to $20 for two.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MELANIE REHAK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the
start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments,
leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate
around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen.
 &HT;    These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my
excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic:
camping.
 &HT;    The idea of sleeping under the stars _ even seeing the stars _
epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that
the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze,
and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.
 &HT;    Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in
New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant
attributes of outdoor life _ the crackle of the fire, the sound of
the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite _ came some
rather difficult logistics.
 &HT;    Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles
had to be put together piece by piece by piece _ an endless
process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded
me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds.
 &HT;    The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no
matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and
twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting
marshmallows on fire.
 &HT;    Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched
innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully
portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a
benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!).
 &HT;    I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded
discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off
the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook
(after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not
dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and
ate scores of hot dogs.
 &HT;    As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I
finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it
had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror
intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion
was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to
camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
 &HT;    Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in
search of a tent _ and got something of a shock. Navigating the
outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed
very far away.
 &HT;    Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing
through the L.L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even five
years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site
of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear
store.
 &HT;    Then I found the link to the REI Outlet Web site,
(www.rei-outlet.com) designed for _ not to mention directed at _
people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical
prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.
 &HT;    Within minutes, I had located the perfect tent for the perfect
price ($52.95). It was made of hunter-green nylon, and had
fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the
front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I
couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it
was mine.
 &HT;    Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time
cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered
on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without.
Most of it was stuff I'd never heard of.
 &HT;    There were ``hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from
built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30
styles of hiking shoes _ for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes,
summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in
10 styles. There were water-filtration systems, gourmet cook sets,
even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.
 &HT;    While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable _
for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not
absorb water _ a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need
microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping
trip? Yet they were tempting.
 &HT;    True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like
hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire.
But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that
certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a
headlamp and a two-way radio _ just in case someone gets lost
looking for the water tap.
 &HT;    I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner
of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.
 &HT;    When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We
pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for
battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles
and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five
minutes.
 &HT;    Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up
the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to
do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that
was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had
arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell
asleep on my air mattress.
 &HT;    A few hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of
collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a
gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was
going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore,
had we remembered bug spray?
 &HT;    In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I
remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well
up.
 &HT;    I found this oddly comforting _ all the high-tech efficiency was
getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans
cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with
s'mores and then it was time for bed.
 &HT;    The trip to the wash house wasn't bad _ we walked along the path
with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in
against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and
insects.
 &HT;    Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and
wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my
sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises
outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had
scanned on the REI site, ``Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food
Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to
the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go
back to sleep.
 &HT;    I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and
ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would
he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me?
 &HT;    My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered
front flap grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was
absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.
 &HT;    Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen
flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all,
cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and
because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my
sneakers were squishy with dew.
 &HT;    The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the
unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the
night, was still great.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I'm looking for a sleek and modern hotel in the heart of
Seattle. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Plush chenille pillows, intimate lighting and an impressive
24-hour concierge service are just a handful of the special touches
that guests can expect at the new W Hotel in Seattle.
 &HT;    Part of the brand-driven W hotel chain launched by Starwood
Hotels and Resorts, the W Seattle is a unique refuge for business
and leisure travelers who have a penchant for hip hotels that
combine sophisticated urban style with relaxed elegance.
 &HT;    Guests love amenities such as high-speed Internet access, luxe
bedding, in-room CD players, 24-hour fitness center and quirky
munchie-bar offerings such as candy necklaces and pez dispensers.
 &HT;    Many of the rooms have office facilities, including scanners,
printers and fax machines. Rates start at $239 to $259 per night.
For more information or reservations, call (877) W Hotels.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I have noticed that cruise ships seem to be
getting bigger. We love the features and activities found on big
ships, but we like the intimacy found on smaller ships. Can we have
our cake and eat it too?
 &HT;     A:  It's true that some of the new cruise ships are so huge
that the enjoyment of being ``at sea'' is lost.
 &HT;    Multideck atriums on some ships feel more like airline terminals
and aren't conducive to meaningful conversation. Dining elbow to
elbow with hundreds of shipmates in a cavernous space in the ship's
belly is often little more than a tedious banquet.
 &HT;    Holland America Line seems to have gotten the message, and the
MS Volendam is the first of the company's new generation of luxury
cruise ships. With a passenger capacity of 1,440, the Volendam is
isn't a small vessel, yet its design gives it the intimate feel of
a much smaller ship. Public rooms are plentiful, but each is
creatively distinct in its ambiance.
 &HT;    So cleverly has Holland America crafted the scale of the
Volendam that, combined with its exquisite furnishings, flattering
lighting and $2 million worth of art, passengers have the
impression they are pampered guests on a private yacht.
 &HT;    Those who desire something other than the dramatic two-deck
747-seat Rotterdam Dining Room are free to reserve a private table
at the beautiful 88-seat Marco Polo Restaurant.
 &HT;    While the opportunity to enlarge its already legendary Ocean Spa
and increase the number of its verandah minisuites by 40 percent
were just two of Holland America's persuasive arguments to build a
large ship, the company's commitment to intimate scale and quality
design has retained the romance of cruising.
 &HT;    Economies of scale dictate that ships will get bigger as
passenger demand continues to grow, but the new MS Volendam is an
eloquent example of how small a big ship can be. For more
information, contact your travel professional, or call (877)
SAIL-HAL (724-5425).
 &HT;     Q:  Where can I go to find good travel information on the Web?
 &HT;     A:  Online travel is the largest internet commerce category on
the Web today as more and more browsers discover how easy it is to
plan travel 24 hours a day from the comfort of their homes or
offices.
 &HT;    However, it is important to choose reputable sites that deliver
reliable and worthwhile services to consumers.
 &HT;    Expedia.com is the online travel-industry leader with over $400
million in sales in the last quarter of this year alone. Touches
such as e-mailing customers to inform them of travel delays and
cancellations have helped the company obtain its leading edge.
 &HT;    They also have chosen to offer travel options for a wide variety
of budgets and are committed to finding the best value for your
dollar. However, they operate on the premise that you get what you
pay for. Take a look: www.expedia.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I finally have the opportunity to visit the Amazon rain
forests _ something I have wanted to do my whole life _ but I'm a
little concerned about traveling there alone.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a place where I can really experience the Amazon
without worrying about being taken advantage of or feeling like an
obvious tourist?
 &HT;     A:  Located on the eastern edge of the Andes Mountains in
Ecuador, a small village houses a collection of cabins that should
suit your needs.
 &HT;    Operated by Beny Ammeter, a Swiss expatriate, La Casa del Suizo
is a small group of cabins that overlooks the Napo River and the
expansive rain forest.
 &HT;    Guests are immediately plunged into the Quichua Indian culture
as soon as they arrive at the resort _ by canoe _ and visit the
village to mingle with the locals; watch blowpipe demonstrations;
learn to make the local alcoholic drink, chicha; and hike through
the awe-inspiring rain forest.
 &HT;    For more infomation, visit www.casadelsuizo.com on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip, and more like it, can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are taking our children to Chicago this
summer. Where do you suggest we take them? As a mom, I'm obligated
to ask for something somewhat educational.
 &HT;     A:  One way to beat the heat is to spend the day at Chicago's
John G. Shedd Aquarium. The aquarium opened its newest exhibit last
month, Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River. Visitors journey
through the annual cycles of the Amazon River basin, which features
over 250 exotic species of animals and explains how they adapt to
the extreme conditions of this ever-changing ecosystem.
 &HT;    Some of the astounding animals your children will see include
the Goliath bird-eating spiders; a green anaconda; and the world's
smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset.
 &HT;    Also, be sure to visit the aquarium's other current exhibits _
the Oceanarium and the Seahorse Symphony. For adults, the aquarium
will be open until 10 p.m. on Thursday nights for Jazzin' at the
Shedd.
 &HT;    For more information, call (312) 939-2438, or visit
www.sheddaquarium.org. Advance tickets are available through
Ticketmaster at (312) 559-0200.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Department of State issued a ``Worldwide Caution'' on
June 27, 2000, it was a telling reminder that the world of
terrorism doesn't relax when Americans take their summer vacations.
 &HT;    The caution urged American ``citizens worldwide of the need to
remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. This Public
Announcement is not in response to a particular threat or event but
to emphasize our ongoing concern for the security of Americans
overseas.''
 &HT;    Indeed, unlike past cautions, which have been linked to specific
terrorist events, this one was much broader. Yet it did single out
one date.
 &HT;    ``Periods on or around significant dates, such as the August 7
anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, may be chosen as opportunities
for further terrorist acts. As a result, security continues to be a
prime concern at U.S. government facilities worldwide.''
 &HT;    Anyone heading abroad would do well to visit the Department of
State's Web site, http://travel.state.gov, and have a look at the
Consular Information Sheets, Public Announcements, Travel Warnings.
 &HT;    There's a Consular Information Sheet for every country in the
world. These reports include information on the location of the
U.S. Embassy or Consulate, health conditions, minor political
disturbances, entry regulations as well as crime and security
information.
 &HT;    As the State Department notes, these reports ``generally do not
include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the
traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a
particular country.''
 &HT;    But if there is an area of a given country where there is some
kind of trouble, it's typically listed under a subhead of ``crime''
or ``security.''
 &HT;    Take a country such as Mexico, which draws many Americans.
Currently, that country's Consular Information Sheet states that
``crime in Mexico continues at high levels, and it is increasingly
violent, especially in Mexico City, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Low
apprehension and conviction rates of criminals contribute to the
high crime rate. Other metropolitan areas have lower, but still
serious levels of crime. Travelers should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place, or not bring them at all. All
visitors are encouraged to make use of hotel safes when available,
avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or designer clothing, and
carry only the cash or credit cards that will be needed on each
outing.''
 &HT;    Obviously, much of this is common sense while traveling, but
given the heightened crime, it bears repeating. For the Bahamas,
the State Department says, ``Visitors should store
passport/identity documents, airline tickets, unused credit cards
and extra cash in hotel safes, and avoid wearing expensive jewelry,
particularly Rolex watches, which have been targeted increasingly
by criminals. Visitors should not travel alone on deserted areas of
beaches or poorly-lit areas at night.''
 &HT;    Even Singapore, which is generally considered one of the safest
places in the world, merits advice: ``Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing and purse or briefcase snatching occur in tourist
areas, hotels and at the airport.''
 &HT;    In the same reports, the government also looks at ``Aviation
Safety Oversight.'' Austria, for example, is in ``compliance with
international safety standards,'' as is most of Western Europe. But
Russia is a different story, and the Department of State says,
``Air travel within Russia can at times be unreliable.''
 &HT;    Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides,
``based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
avoid travel to a certain country.'' These countries currently
include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Montserrat,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia-Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tajikistan and Yemen.
 &HT;    These countries are seen as potentially dangerous places for
Americans, and the State Department recommends that Americans avoid
going there.
 &HT;    The Fiji warning, issued on June 28, says, ``The Department of
State urges U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Fiji
because of continued uncertainty and instability resulting from the
ongoing political crisis.''
 &HT;    It goes on to say that U.S. citizens who remain ``should
exercise a high level of caution, avoid demonstrations or public
meetings, maintain adequate stocks of food and water, and monitor
the local radio closely for breaking developments.''
 &HT;    That's hardly a recipe for a nice tropical vacation.
 &HT;    Finally, there are Public Announcements. These are issued for
``terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or
transnational conditions posing significant risks to the security
of American travelers.''
 &HT;    The public announcement for Indonesia and East Timor, issued on
June 1, says, ``all American citizens traveling in these areas
should be aware of their surroundings and use common sense to avoid
situations and locations that could be inherently dangerous.''
 &HT;    Travelers who want a broader perspective can consult the Web
sites of such governments as Great Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada
(www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca) or Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/consular) and
make up their own mind about whether it's really safe to go.
 &HT;    For those without access to the Internet, the Department of
State's ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' and other travel-related documents
can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; (202) 512-1800.

   EPISCOPARY-WOMAN _ In November 1787, when Richard Allen stormed
out of the predominantly white St. George's Church in Philadelphia
and formed the African Free Society (later renamed the African
Methodist Episcopal Church), the thought of bringing a woman into
the hierarchy of his clan never entered his mind. But the prospect
of selecting a female to the lofty position of AME bishop could not
escape the minds of the 1,800 delegates who attended the order's
closely scrutinized General Conference at the Cincinnati Convention
Center this week. In a landmark, second-ballot vote, the Rev.
Vashti Murphy McKenzie, 53, of Baltimore, Md., was elected to the
Episcopary, becoming the first female in the 213-year history of
the church to assume that seat. (Dayton Daily News).

 &HT;    Joe Belle inspired all he met
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This is not a time for pettiness, but I can't
help feeling peeved that, until last fall, I appear to have been
the only person in town who didn't know Joe Belle.
</P>
<P>
   If he was Mr. UD (University of Dayton), Mr. Personality and all
that, don't you think he could have taken the trouble to call me
up?
</P>
<P>
   I wish to God, at any rate, that when I met the beloved UD
administrator it was for any other reason than what it was: A
feature story about his fight against a rare and deadly form of
brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it is a rare privilege to have known a man like
Joe, who died Sunday at 50: A man whose love of life, love of
family, become even deeper when faced with losing them.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't going to be one of those ``good comes out of
tragedy'' epiphanies. It's true, as close friend Steve Yuhas
eulogized Tuesday, ``that the past 14 months have been a gift from
God to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Much good has come from Joe's illness and the inspiration he has
given so many. But much, much more good would have come out of
having Joe around for the next 40 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm still in the anger phase. That's a luxury Joe didn't
allow himself as he endured three surgeries and a grueling medical
regimen, while continuing to work until several weeks ago. ``People
say, `Aren't you mad at God?' '' Joe said. ``I don't have time to
be mad at God now. I need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I got to know Joe, he speedily made up for his previous
neglect. He wouldn't let me linger for very long in my safety zone
as a reporter. It was almost impossible to know him without knowing
him as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   So I joined hundreds of other mourners at Joe's funeral Tuesday
morning at St. Albert the Great Church in Kettering. Nearly every
face in the overflow crowd was tear-streaked. ``It was a real
tribute to Joe that we had to open both sides of the church
today,'' Pastor Jim Manning greeted the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   How could one man make such an impact on so many?
</P>
<P>
   It's something more than his irresistible wit, at once biting
and gentle. Something more, even, than the infectious exuberance of
this 5-foot-5 Italian leprechaun with a Paul Bunyan-sized zest for
living.
</P>
<P>
   Even when facing death, he put others first. In accepting UD's
Lackner award, which recognizes individuals who exemplify the
Marianist sense of hospitality, his first words were of wife, Barb,
``the pillar of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   When I visited him for the last time, on July 4, Joe was clearly
in pain, unable to eat. ``I'm ready,'' he said, ``but the Lord
won't take me.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking was clearly an effort, but he made the effort _ and his
thoughts were on his visitors. He wanted to make sure we sampled
the homemade pasta Aunt Martha made the night before.
</P>
<P>
   No one had expected him to awaken from the coma into which he
had fallen the Friday before. But he did, as if willing himself to
give his loved ones the gift of a goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He even organized an impromptu champagne toast the Monday before
his death, inviting dozens of close friends to share the bottle of
Millennium champagne left over from New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, an Italian wake that the Irish could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the disease, Joe acted each day as if it were a
blessing to be alive,'' Yuhas said in his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped himself, realizing he had belabored the obvious:
``But if you knew Joe, you know that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right; he didn't need to tell us. We knew.
</P>
<P>
   For those who knew Joe Belle, it's a lesson not likely to be
forgotten.

 &HT;    From post to pillory
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have been pleased to discover, in Jonesville, La.,
someone who shares my concern about e-mail, which has become all
too popular and a serious threat to intimate personal
communication, and to a unique way of recording history.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Womack writes a column for her Jonesville parish newspaper.
She sent a copy of one lamenting the decline of old-fashioned
letter-writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received an antique form of correspondence last week,'' she
wrote. ``It was a real letter, handwritten, put in an envelope,
stamped and mailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter was from my Aunt Jessie Patterson, Mama's sister,
who lives in Yazoo City, Miss. Her letters are always fun to read,
filled with family news and witty comments. For instance:
'Something happens to grandsons when they get to be 13. Their heads
get hot, and the only place they can cool them off is in the
refrigerator. By the time they leave, the refrigerator and the
cupboards are as bare as Mother Hubbard's.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I derive a true satisfaction from receiving a personal letter.
Oh, I get letters all the time. 'Dear Alma Womack,' they say. 'You
are a valued customer. . .' or, 'We want you to run up $2,000 of
debt, for which we will happily charge you interest at Mafia
rates.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Hillary send letters asking for my help and money to
defeat the conservative forces bent on sending the Clintons into
oblivion. I get at least a letter a week advising me that I have
become a millionaire. These make good kindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter still sends me articles through the mail; things
she can't send on a computer, I mean e-mail. But friends I've
corresponded with since school days rarely write anymore. They all
want to e-mail me, which had been impossible until the last few
months, since I had nothing to e-mail to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Alma, I held out on e-mail until I became an embarrassment
to my children and granddaughter. It was a mistake to give in. I
didn't know that with e-mail you can make a list of everybody you
know, or everybody in the phone book, and send them a copy of all
the e-mail you send or receive. Everybody else on e-mail can do the
same. E-mail works like an upside-down pyramid. It grows like
kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon I was getting about 8,000 e-mails a day. I didn't
have time to read them, but if you don't get rid of them your
computer will explode. I was spending 12 to 15 hours a day deleting
raunchy jokes, warnings about the end of the world, the Religious
Right, the Far Left, the Clintons, earth warming, earth cooling and
John Rocker. From strangers I'd never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   People who are otherwise respectable and have good taste wil
over, then put them back in a box for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With e-mail, we are losing not only our personal touches with
each other, but we also are depriving future generations of the
pleasure of finding a trunk filled with missives from another time.
E-mail may be fast and efficient, but like instant coffee and
instant grits, goodness has been sacrificed for speed.' '' Right,
Alma.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on rainy afternoons, I sit in my depot hideaway and
reread letters written by my ancestors, all the way back to before
the Civil War. They tell me a lot about who they were, and who I
am. I don't think they'd be the same on a floppy disk.

 &HT;    Research linking left-handedness, gays spurs humorous
observations
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ During the 71st All-Star Game in Atlanta I caught
myself paying more attention to the left-handed players.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, I read a news story in The Times of London
that said homosexuals are more likely to be left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The story was based on a study by Canadian researchers involving
more than 23,000 men and women. The results, according to Nigel
Hawkes, the newspaper's science editor, is that the odds of being
left-handed are 39 percent higher in homosexuals than in
heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   While watching 6-foot-10-inch lefty fireballer Randy ``Big
Unit'' Johnson, the starting National League pitcher, bear down on
switch-hitter Roberto Alomar, I thought of gay power. I couldn't
help it.
</P>
<P>
   The study didn't say that left-handed people were homosexual, I
knew that. It simply said that left-handers are more likely to be
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   So there was no reason to watch for nuances in the way big
first-baseman Jason Giambi, who batted cleanup, dug in at the plate
before taking his left-handed cut at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the study said the left-handed effect is much stronger
in lesbian women than in gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``While homosexual men are only 34 percent more likely to be
left-handed, homosexual women have nearly twice as many
left-handers as heterosexual women,'' said the news story about the
study that appears in this month's issue of Psychology Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   NEW WAY TO VIEW GAME
</P>
<P>
   After Big Unit retired Giambi, David Wells took the mound for
the American League. Wells, nicknamed Boomer, was another
left-handed hurler. Research that shows homosexuals are more likely
to be left-handed sure offers baseball fans a new way to watch a
ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Canadian study interested me is because I've
written about earlier studies that indicated homosexuality is a
genetic condition inherited at birth. Those discoveries caused
consternation among some religious fundamentalists who believe that
homosexuality is an unnatural lifestyle choice that deserves holy
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   If homosexuality is genetic, it means sexual orientation is a
product of nature, not nurture. And if a person's sexual
orientation is determined even before birth, then religious
fundamentalists would be forced to conclude that it is a God-given
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   Religious fundamentalists find God-given attributes difficult to
condemn. It's a lot easier to blame homosexuality on an
individual's sinful choice rather than accept the fact that
homosexuality is naturally occurring in the same way that
male-pattern baldness or the ability to carry a tune is inherited.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, I've written that medical research
appears to show that homosexuality is an inherited trait in much
the same way as being born left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   I threw that comment into my discourse because it appears that
roughly 10 percent of the population is left-handed and about the
same percentage is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   My observation did not go down well with religious
fundamentalists who condemn homosexuality as a sin against God.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some homosexuals also don't like the idea that
their sexual orientation is something they can't control any more
than they can control the color of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the consistent similarity between the numbers of
homosexuals and left-handers in society, I also compared the two
conditions because I am left-handed. I never dreamed that one day
medical researchers would overlap the two traits.
</P>
<P>
   At least, I've found an interesting new way to watch an All-Star
game.

 &HT;    Beware: Snoop software can record your every keystroke
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us live lives of quiet boredom. We don't steal
atomic secrets, plan hostile mergers, or plot to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Worst case, you may say something mean-spirited in an e-mail,
brag about cheating the IRS out of a few bucks, or make a joke that
you wouldn't repeat to an assemblage of scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I don't know anyone who wants to make his life an open
book. Few of us would invite someone to sit down and read
everything in our computer, to browse all the e-mails stored there,
even to be able to read notes that were started and erased without
ever being saved.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has become _ over the years _ the most private of
personal secretaries. Until recently the information you stored
there was at least as safe from gossip as if you entrusted it to a
human secretary.
</P>
<P>
   There were ways _ of various sophistication _ of snooping. Even
years ago, there were programs _ distributed quietly on bulletin
boards and Web pages run by hackers _ called keyboard logging
programs. They hid in the shadows of your hard disk and were almost
impossible to detect by the user. They logged every keystroke on
that particular machine. Then, the hacker could sit down at the
machine at his leisure, enter a password and read a transcript that
showed every keystroke made.
</P>
<P>
   While that isn't exactly a great thing, the chances of being
snared by one of those programs were slim. Most ordinary people
didn't even know such programs existed, and some amount of computer
skill was required to locate and install the programs. There just
wasn't a big risk that you'd bump into something like that.
</P>
<P>
   But, within the past few months, the chances of someone _ a
spouse, a friend, a co-worker _ taking a private look at every word
you've written have jumped way up. That same type of spying
software is now available down at your favorite computer store.
There are now commercial programs _ selling in the $50 range _ that
are as easy to use as a word processor. Simply load one into a
computer and _ just like the old hacker programs _ you can read
every typed secret at a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these programs exist including Spector, 007 Stealth
Activity Recorder, Cyber Snoop and eBlaster (we'll talk more about
this one later). The basic idea is that the program hides in the
computer and serves as a high tech peeping Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are supposed to be able to make sure that kids aren't
hanging out on the wrong electronic blocks in cyberspace. Spouses
theoretically can use it to make sure a partner isn't engaged in
extracurricular sex _ either the real thing or the cyber version.
Even that rubs me wrong, but there would be those who disagree, so
I'll leave the question for those smarter than myself.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a genius to figure that some people are
going to use these programs in really twisted ways. Kids will snoop
on parents, boyfriends on girlfriends, and _ probably most likely _
a lot of folks will snoop just for the fun of it, turning your life
into a real-life soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if programs like Spector aren't frightening enough,
software such as eBlaster takes snooping to a higher level. That
program can be set up to send the details of what you type on your
computer by e-mail. Which means that the person who wants to spy on
your computer only needs access to it one time. After installing
the program, he can harvest the details of your life from the
safety of his home computer. And no trail of the e-mails remains on
the host computer.
</P>
<P>
   Finding these programs is easy at the store but difficult once
they're installed on the computer. After all, that's the whole
idea. They're made to hide and reside in hidden directories that
won't show up in a routine search. And since the person who
installs them can set the hidden command needed to view the log
files, you're unlikely to ever notice the program once it is
installed. Since the hidden logs files take up 50 megabytes or more
on the hard disk, one way to detect them would be to check hard
disk space. But in these days of 20 gigabyte hard drives, even that
isn't very practical.
</P>
<P>
   So the real secret _ when it comes to avoiding the risk that
someone might plant one of these sinister programs on your PC _ is
to know who your friends are. Which isn't such a bad thing, no
matter what your secrets are.

   RARE-BIRD _ On April 1, 1999, David Kulivan was trying to kill
his first wild turkey in the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area
of Louisiana. Instead he spotted two large, vivid birds and sparked
a debate among birders over whether the ivory-billed woodpecker is
indeed extinct. With photo, graphic. 2,000 words.

   WHITMAN-PHOTO _ Sporting a wide grin, Christie Todd Whitman, the
governor of New Jersey, is shown patting down a young black male on
the streets of Camden during a 1996 State Police drug sweep. The
picture is grainy and unfocused, like a home snapshot. But the
reaction in the week since the photo's release has been dramatic.

&HT;     LEARNING CAREER LESSONS FROM `JAWS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What do you get when you combine millions of
dollars, heart-racing excitement, abject terror and senseless
carnage? All right, an Internet start-up. But besides that?
</P>
<P>
   You get ``Jaws,'' one of the greatest films ever made, which is
being officially re-hyped this week with the release of its 25th
anniversary video. And anytime you speak of greed and carnage,
you're talking the language of the American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the office, here
are four career lessons from ``Jaws'':
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen for the music.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of partying, a woman goes for a skinny-dip. After
a moment's peace, a great white shark rips her into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmer had no idea what was about to happen, of course, but
the audience knew she had a future in the fast-food industry. For
what seemed like minutes before the attack, the theme from ``Jaws''
let you know that the shark was salivating.
</P>
<P>
   (I don't know that sharks really salivate. But lawyers do, so
I'm making a logical assumption.)
</P>
<P>
   Characters in a production are sometimes oblivious to clues that
outside observers can easily see. That's why your network should
always include people not only from outside your company, but from
related industries. They might be hearing the music while you're
naked and oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money will compromise your judgment.
</P>
<P>
   We all realize that, but it can still sneak up on you. You'll
make an emotional decision based on greed, then either rationalize
what you're doing or go into denial.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jaws,'' town officials don't want to shut the island during
the busy tourist season because it would cost them tons of money,
so they try to explain away the first couple of attacks as
mysteries or boating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and workers run into this all the time, and not just
in obvious matters of professional ethics. People find themselves
in unsatisfactory careers, and the fear of the unknown locks them
into that weekly paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   As people earn more money, they classify a lot of life's goodies
as necessities when they're really luxuries. If you're unhappy and
afraid that quitting your job or cutting back will put a hardship
on your family, sit down and figure out what you'd really be giving
up. Are they luxuries or necessities?
</P>
<P>
   It could be that all these ``logical'' reasons you're giving for
not changing careers are merely rationalizations. You don't want to
admit that you're afraid of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   _ You will need a bigger boat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time anybody sees the shark in ``Jaws,'' it's too late to
do anything about the size of the boat. The heroes are already
trapped in a life-or-death struggle with the shark.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been a bad networker and have been in denial about
problems at your company, you might not realize how much danger
you're in until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   The more skills you have, the bigger your boat is. What can you
do better than your peers? Does your boss know that you're still
growing, or do you appear to be dead in the water? What have you
done lately without being asked?
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have the skills and the energy, the shark still
might destroy your boat. But you'll find another one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eventually, the shark will lose.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, but people who come in and cause a lot of
carnage at a company don't usually stick around for the long haul.
They'll either go off in search of new prey, or the workers will
rebel so much that the ``shark'' will be forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind if you want a long future with the company.
Not only do you want to escape the giant shark, but you want to
stay away from the feeding frenzy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there's a shark around, it doesn't pay to get too
chummy.

&HT;     GENERATION X RINGMASTER SHARES SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DANIEL J. VARGAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnathan Lee Iverson is the new kid under the Big Top.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest and 31st ringmaster of the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus, the 24-year-old is the darling of the
circus.
</P>
<P>
   This Manhattan native is a towering 6-foot-5-inches with the
voice of an operatic tenor. Just as impressive, he's the first
African-American to serve as ringmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked is Iverson's rich sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   So, we decided to forgo the standard interview and ask him a few
offbeat questions _ to find out what circus life has been like for
this Gen-X ringmaster during his first six months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I imagine you won't be a ringmaster the rest of your life.
Have you thought about how this job is going to look on your
resume?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it will look pretty good. It's very unique. I've
started my career with a home-run hit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you ran away from the circus, where would you go and why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Brazil. The women. Everybody is gorgeous in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the strangest thing you've seen behind the tent flaps?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a hard one. I think it was discovering that people
hate getting old. Some of the guys are like 17-year-olds stuck in
65-year-old bodies, and they hate every moment of it. They're big
flirts talking to the younger girls after the show. It's nothing
dirty or anything, just funny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were on the show Survivor and you had to vote off a
fellow circus colleague from the island, who would you vote off
first: a clown, a trapeze artist or an animal trainer?
</P>
<P>
   A: That is so hard. It's hard with the circus. I'm not trying to
cover my ass. Everyone here is so good at what they do. It wouldn't
be fair. The circus has figured out what the rest of the world
hasn't: It's learned how to work as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, come on now, you have to ditch one of them.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's so hard to say. Well, I guess if we were on a deserted
island, there would be a lot of trees so we would need a trapeze
artist.
</P>
<P>
   If a crazy animal comes at us, we'd need an animal trainer. I
guess we'd bounce off the clown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you ever afraid of clowns? How about now?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not at all. I have a great respect for clowns and
clowning.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you just ousted the clown off the island.
</P>
<P>
   A: I wouldn't vote (clowns) off the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had your choice between cleaning up after the
elephants or feeding the tigers, which would you choose?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd clean up after the elephants. No problem. I have a tough
nose. I'm from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're still young enough to be on MTV's The Real World. What
kind of roommate would you be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd be a cool roommate. I'll admit I like to get on people's
nerves to see how far I can go. But I'm a low-maintenance kind of
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Because you're a potential troublemaker do you think your
roommates would kick you out of the house?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all. I'm too interesting. I'd find a way to stay on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your least favorite circus animal?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's easy: horses. They're the most faithless animal on the
face of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the circus life first scared you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you sure? I don't believe you.
</P>
<P>
   A: Really.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever had to break up a circus fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It was broken up by the time I got there. It was between
an acrobat and an animal trainer. Of course, it was over a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who won?
</P>
<P>
   A: They didn't have a chance to swing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So it really wasn't a fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I guess not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do circus performers do for fun? That is, when they're
not shooting themselves out of canons or cramming themselves into
tiny cars.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have barbecues and go clubbing. There are other things,
too, but that will be in my uncensored book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who in the circus would be your phone-a-friend lifeline on
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Human Comet _ J.P. Theron. He knows so much useless info.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever met someone like that?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is that your final answer?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughing): Yeah, that's my final answer.

&HT;     HONDA BOOSTS PRODUCTION OF HYBRID CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   To help meet consumer demand, Honda has increased availability
of its new Insight gasoline-electric car to 6,500 units for
calendar year 2000, up from the originally planned 4,000 cars, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   With an EPA rating of 70 miles per gallon, the Insight has the
highest fuel economy of any car in the world. Consumers across the
nation are on the waiting list for the cars, which went on sale in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The two-seat Insight is powered by a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder
gasoline engine and an electric motor, which kicks in when needed
to boost power. The electric motor receives its power from a bank
of nickel-metal-hydride batteries that are recharged while the
vehicle is driving on the gasoline engine; it does not have to be
connected to an external charger the way that all-electric cars
must be.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is rolling out a four-passenger hybrid, the Prius, this
summer at its U.S. dealerships; that vehicle has been on sale in
Japan since December 1997.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   FOCUS EARNS 4 STARS FOR SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   The new two-door Ford Focus subcompact garnered a four-star
rating (out of a possible five stars) for the driver, but just one
star for the rear-seat passenger in the latest crash tests posted
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   To check on crash ratings of the Focus and other 2000 models
that have already been tested and posted on the agency's Web site,
go to www.nhtsa.dot.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the crash tests of the all-new Chrysler PT Cruiser
still have not been posted, although at least one of the vehicles
has been tested.
</P>
<P>
   For both frontal and side impacts, the federal agency's New Car
Assessment Program reports crash test results in a range of one to
five stars, with five stars showing the best crash protection for
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Frontal tests should be compared only within the same weight
class.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you without Web access, a fact sheet containing
explanatory information and tables showing crash-test results for
model year 2000 vehicles is available by calling the NHTSA Office
of Public and Consumer Affairs, (202) 366-9550; the Auto Safety
Hotline, (888) 327-4236; or by writing to NHTSA Public Affairs,
Room 5232, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, D.C. 20590.

&HT;     NIMBLE ALERO IS NOTHING LIKE THE OLDS OF OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oldsmobile finally has built an affordable car that is every bit
as good as one of those Japanese sedans that consumers like so
much.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced just last year as Oldsmobile's import-buster,
mass-market compact sedan, the Alero already has become the choice
for many consumers who otherwise would have bought a Honda Accord,
Nissan Altima, Mazda 626, Mitsubishi Galant or other import brands
in this market segment.
</P>
<P>
   My weeklong test drive of the Alero GLS gave me a new
appreciation for American auto manufacturing, particularly at
General Motors, where compact and midsize sedans have taken a back
seat to the Japanese for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   What I found is that there really is no need to buy an Accord if
what you really want is a well-built American sedan in the same
price class. The Accord, for many reasons, has been the top choice
of compact/midsize buyers for the past several years, and it has
perennially battled with the Ford Taurus and Toyota Camry for the
honors of top-selling car in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But giving the Alero a try, especially not long after testing an
Accord and a Galant, made a believer out of me. If Olds can attract
baby boomers and Generation X-ers into its showrooms, I believe it
can sell them the Alero, instead of losing them to the Accord or
other imports.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero had a much more solid feel than the Accord, with road
handling that was surprisingly nimble and athletic. I almost
couldn't believe I was driving an American sedan, let alone an
Oldsmobile -- one of those GM brands known for decades for its big,
boatlike, wallowing sedans that appealed mostly to consumers beyond
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile began re-inventing itself in the mid-90s with the
introduction of the Aurora premium sedan, which I have said before
is one of the best cars GM or any other automaker has ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   While the Alero isn't in the same class as the $30,000-plus
Aurora, it is well above the class of some of its competitors in
the compact/midsize segment. Although technically classified by the
EPA as a compact because of its overall interior volume, the Alero
offers the roominess and interior comfort of midsize models such as
the Camry, Nissan Maxima and Volkswagen Passat.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero, which replaced the ho-hum Achieva sedan and is on the
same basic vehicle chassis as the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac
Grand Am, comes well-equipped to compete with just about any car in
the compact segment, including the Infiniti G20 and Volvo S40.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a cut above the Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique, the closest competitors in the Ford/Lincoln-Mercury
lineups.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy less-well-equipped Alero models that compete
head-to-head with the Contour, Mystique and Accord; the base engine
in the Alero GL and GX models is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder similar
to the base engines in the Contour, Accord and Altima.
</P>
<P>
   But the GLS1 model _ $22,095 including transportation _ comes
with a 170-horsepower, 3.4-liter V-6 engine and leather interior,
moving it up into the higher echelons to compete with the Maxima,
Camry, G20 and S40.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile says the Alero and other vehicles in its current
lineup, including the midsize Intrigue sedan, Silhouette minivan
and Bravada sport-utility, have helped lower the average age of
Olds buyers by six years. That trend is going to continue next
spring when Olds introduces its completely revised Bravada.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Alero buyers are primarily women, although I know of no
reason why this car should not appeal to men as well. And there is
solid evidence that this car is luring buyers away from the
imports.
</P>
<P>
   GM says up to 50 percent of Alero buyers have told their dealers
they would have bought an import if the Alero had not been
available. That's an important statistic for GM, because making
such ``conquest'' sales over imports is GM's primary marketing goal
for the Alero.
</P>
<P>
   What this car signifies most, perhaps, is that family-sedan
buyers don't have to compromise on anything to choose the Alero
over an import. This car is a smart buy for savvy consumers who
heretofore have believed that imports represent the best long-range
value.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is comfortable without being overly cushy, so there was
no feeling that I was driving one of those old-fashioned
Oldsmobiles. Those are gone, anyway; all current Olds products are
geared toward younger buyers and aren't anything like the Olds of
old.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't find much to dislike about the Alero. My only two
gripes had to do with the trunk. It's large enough to hold 14.7
cubic feet of stuff, but the opening is somewhat limited, which
restricts the size of objects you can put back there. This is not
unique to the Alero, however; it is a problem found in many cars in
this class.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the trunk on the Alero had a weird catch that would not
allow the trunk to latch without first pushing a button on the side
of the latch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is some new kind of safety feature to prevent small
children from accidentally locking themselves in the trunk, but if
so, there is nothing in the Olds literature that mentions it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of a nuisance; if I tried to shut the trunk without
first pushing this button, the trunk lid just bounced back up.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of power with the V-6 engine, and the four-speed
automatic transmission shifts smoothly and seamlessly. Granted,
there are midsize sedans with more power, but this car has as much
zip as most people will ever need.
</P>
<P>
   I've driven the four-cylinder model, too, and also found it
adequate for most needs. The extra power offered by the V-6 engine
will help if you routinely carry a car full of people and stuff,
but for those of you who want a more affordable car, the
four-cylinder models should be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Alero isn't really a sporty car, Olds is offering a
five-speed, Getrag manual transmission for model year 2000 for
people who want more performance than convenience. But it is
available only with the four-cylinder engine, which does not come
in the GLS model.
</P>
<P>
   Standard GLS equipment includes traction control, manual
air-conditioning, six-way power driver's seat, premium
AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo, leather interior, automatic
on/off halogen headlights, four-wheel antilock disc brakes,
stainless-steel exhaust system, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
remote keyless entry, 16-inch polished-aluminum wheels, cruise
control, front bucket seats with console shifter, illuminated entry
system, and large (and readable) analog gauges.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-6 are 20 miles per gallon in
the city and 32 mpg on the highway.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Who almost got it right more than a
quarter-century ago when they sang that rock was dead. It turns out
it's rock video that's flatlined.
</P>
<P>
   But the rock TV drama _ that's different. The live-fast-die
young-leave-a-good looking-corpse mentality of the 1960s and '70s
laid the foundation for numerous movie projects, not to mention
14,867 installments of ``VH1: Behind the Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The rock movie has been around in theaters since the 1950s;
today, television has been tapping that vein (so to speak), most
notably in the VH1 documentary series. But the network and others
have branched out into excavating the drama of rock, both in
biopics and a couple of new fictional series coming this fall.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, which used to play rock videos back in the day, has
branched out in many different directions (likewise, country cousin
TNN is also moving away from videos). One will be a new series
``Live Through This,'' in which a fictional seminal group from the
'70s, the Jackson Decker Band, reunite to go on tour with their
various children, ages 12 to 24. Hey, isn't that the MTV
demographic?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, VH1 will continue what it started last season by
rolling out more rock 'n' roll flicks. The slate includes: a biopic
on Meat Loaf subtitled ``To Hell and Back''; the comedy ``Out of
Sync,'' in which a gorgeous but off-key singer has her vocals
dubbed by the ugly duckling with the gorgeous voice (only in
television would Gail O'Grady, late of ``NYPD Blue,'' qualify as
ugly); and ``At Any Cost,'' the typical story in which rock 'n'
roll kills and soars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this fear that one of these years, I'm going to stand
up here and have nothing to say except, `We've run out of rock
history to strip-mine,''' VH1 executive vice president Jeff Gaspin
told reporters at the Television Critics Association Press Tour
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Even Showtime is getting involved: In ``The Chris Isaak Show,''
the rocker and his band play themselves in a mockumentary akin to
the late, great ``Larry Sanders Show.'' Isaak, who conducted one of
the funniest news conferences in recent memory at the press tour,
said the stories will be fiction based on his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have people that we can kill off every week,'' he
said. Don't put it past him.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a fly in the programming ointment: Most of the
rock-as-drama fare we've seen on television the past few years
stinks. Really stinks. You know I want to go further than that, but
I can't, so take what I'm saying and run with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I didn't do one,'' said rock legend David Crosby,
who was promoting ``Stand and Be Counted,'' a documentary
miniseries on the history of music as agent for social change (it
debuts next month on The Learning Channel).
</P>
<P>
   While Crosby's life, and much of what we see on ``Behind the
Music,'' is perfect dramatic fare, the Woodstock veteran wants no
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have been so trashy and so shallow that they're
really not worth watching,'' he said. ``I cite the Beach Boys one
(ABC's `An American Family') as an example. I've been asked to do
one for my autobiography (`Long Time Gone') over and over again,
but I'm not willing to have my life memorialized in a six-week
movie for TV. They don't do it well enough.''

   THE REALITY ABOUT REALITY TV
</P>
<P>
   While networks are looking to get on the reality gravy train
following the success of ``Survivor,'' MTV is heading off in a
different direction.
</P>
<P>
   The home of ``Real World,'' the original ``Big Brother'' and
``Road Rules'' based much of its success on the novelty of those
shows. For a network whose money is made on being cutting-edge,
being part of the crowd is not where it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to make a list of my Top 10 concerns for MTV,
(reality-show proliferation) is absolutely No. 1,'' said Brian
Graden, MTV's president of programming. ``Now we're no longer alone
in doing that, and so the question is: What is MTV's point of
distinction going to be going forward?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``While they're hanging their hats on reality _
which was important to us for the last five years _ we're probably
hanging our hat on (computer) interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect point of transition is the new show ``DFX,'' in which
viewers will vote on line for what videos they want to see: Its
host, Teck Holmes, was one of the housemates on ``Real World
Hawaii.''

   DIVERSE DIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Hispanic characters, let alone shows devoted to
them, remains an inexplicable blight on network television.
Showtime recently added the drama ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which
chronicles a Hispanic family. Now Nickelodeon is going even
further, introducing three shows in which Hispanics are featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers Garcia,'' a live-action comedy series following
the lives of a San Antonio family, premieres at 8:30 p.m. July 23.
It's narrated in flashback by John Leguizamo (``Summer of Sam''):
``I'm the Latin Daniel Stern,'' Leguizamo said, referring to the
narrator on the similarly constructed show ``The Wonder Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taina,'' a half-hour show about a teen-age Hispanic girl with
dreams of musical stardom, debuts on the cable network in October.
August brings ``Dora the Explorer,'' a preschool animated show
about a Hispanic girl who lives insides a computer.
</P>
<P>
   For additional diversity, the network will offer ``Pelswick,'' a
cartoon about a 13-year-old in a wheelchair, in October. Judging
from some preview clips, this series from nationally syndicated
cartoonist and author John Callahan (who is quadriplegic) could be
wickedly funny and irreverent.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ The subjects seem disparate, scattered: a
war, a sport, a musical genre. But documentarian Ken Burns saw the
thread, and knew how to weave it into the story of a country.
</P>
<P>
   First was ``Civil War.'' Then came ``Baseball.'' To complete his
American trilogy, Burns says he's trading in the violins that
marked those two works for the saxophone: ``Jazz,'' a 10-part PBS
series, clocks in a shade under 19 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the opening moments of our history of baseball,'' Burns
told television critics this week, ``the writer Gerald Early told
us that when they study our civilization 2,000 years from now,
Americans will be known for only three things: the Constitution,
baseball and jazz music.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his previous works, the miniseries uses the subject matter
as the locus for a number of issues, chief among them race.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Jan. 8, ``Jazz'' chronicles the lives and music of
greats ranging from Dave Brubeck to Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Armstrong ``is the most important person in music _ I
didn't say jazz: in music _ in the 20th century. He is to music
what Einstein is to physics, and what the Wright Brothers are to
travel.''

   50 YEARS OF WINTERS

   If all you do is read the transcribed words of Jonathan Winters,
his humor can't be fully appreciated. It's all in the eyes and
mouth, the little ticks and twinkles that sell the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Winters _ the performer who once inspired a young comic named
Robin Williams _ will be featured in ``Jonathan Winters: On the
Loose,'' a PBS special airing in August. With nearly 50 years of
material to choose from, the documentary mines a wealth of
television clips, particularly from ``The Jack Paar Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The man known for a dizzying array of characters (most notably
the dizzy old lady Maude Frickert) also talks about his emotional
problems and nervous breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was classic manic-depressive, and now considered bipolar _
and I haven't been to either pole,'' he said.

&HT;     TEXAS REVAMPS LOTTO TO BOOST SAGGING SALES

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After nearly eight years, picking six numbers
between 1 and 50 for a ticket to millions of dollars will end
Saturday night for Lotto Texas players.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, tickets for the twice-weekly game will have
players selecting from a field of 54 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jackpots will still start at $4 million, lottery
officials say accumulated jackpots will be higher than before.
</P>
<P>
   Because the odds of winning will be increased from 1 in 15.8
million to 1 in 25.8 million, there should be fewer winners. That
means jackpots should accumulate over a greater number of drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Lottery Commission members unanimously approved the
changes at their monthly meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the changes could bring $166 million more in
annual sales and add $26 million more to the Foundation School
Fund, which provides money for education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Old play slips will not operate in terminals after Saturday. New
play slips will be available Sunday for Wednesday's drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Players will see other changes in addition to having to select
from 54 numbers. Anyone matching five of six numbers will win
$2,500 instead of the current $1,500, while players matching four
of six will receive $105 instead of $100. Matching three of six
will increase to $5 from $3.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of four numbers is the first significant change to
Lotto Texas since it was introduced in November 1992 with starting
jackpots of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said the latest modifications were necessary
because of the decline in sales since 1997. Larger jackpots are
expected to increase ticket sales and attract players who yawn at
payoffs of less than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The average jackpot in 1999 was $11.39 million; average weekly
sales were $12.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think players will like this very much because the higher
the jackpot, the higher the interest,'' lottery spokeswoman Leticia
Vasquez said. ``There's a lot of excitement out there, and
aficionados are going to find that the game is better than it used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Dawn Nettles, publisher of ``Lotto Report,''
available on the World Wide Web and at retailers in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to work,'' Nettles said Wednesday. ``Players
have already backed off and quit in disgust because they never win
anything. The other half that hasn't yet will, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nettles, who urged the three-member lottery commission in May to
vote against the change to 54 balls, said she no longer plays Lotto
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play $15 every drawing, but now I'll just play Cash
5 and Pick 3,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sanchez, who shared an $18.4 million in May 1995 with nine
coworkers, said he would continue to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everything else, it's luck, so I'll still play,'' said
Sanchez, who retired from Alamo Iron Works in San Antonio four
years ago and spends $5 to $10 on Lotto Texas tickets per drawing.

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Former South African President Nelson
Mandela closed the 13th International AIDS Conference on Friday
with the kind of rousing speech and call to action many had hoped
to hear earlier from his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not equivocate: a tragedy of unprecedented proportions
is unfolding in Africa,'' Mandela said. ``Decades have been chopped
from life expectancy _ half of our young people will die of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela took pains not to criticize current President Thabo
Mbeki, whose speech opening the conference on Sunday was a major
disappointment to delegates. They had hoped he would back away from
his interest in the ideas of dissidents who do not believe the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said the controversy surrounding the issue has created a
distraction from the life and death issues facing Africa and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinary people of the continent and the world, and
particularly the poor who on our continent will again carry a
disproportionate burden of this scourge, would, if anybody cared to
ask their opinions, wish that the dispute about the primacy of
politics or science be put on the back burner and we proceed to
address the needs and concerns of those suffering and dying,''
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela is revered as a moral authority in South Africa and
around the world, having endured 27 years in prison under the
former apartheid government and then leading the country into a
non-racial democracy. However, it has been noted that he failed to
give much attention to the growing AIDS epidemic while he was
president from 1994 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He drew his greatest applause when he endorsed programs to give
anti-retroviral therapy to pregnant women and newborns to cut the
chances they will become infected. The South African government has
been criticized for resisting such measures, claiming first that
the drugs were too toxic and later that not enough evidence had
been gathered to justify approving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introducing measures to reduce mother-to-child transmission
have been proven to be essential in the fight against AIDS,''
Mandela said. He called for implementing them on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   The acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction in
which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products. Africa is
among the regions hardest hit by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's talk was ``music to our ears,'' said conference
chairman Hoosen Coovadia, who had not hidden his disappointment
with Mbeki's talk. Mandela's speech, he said, ``has answered so
many unspoken and spoken questions. It has stirred us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates were ecstatic with Mandela's uncompromising and
compassionate speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant,'' said Backson Muchino of Zimbabwe. ``Just what I
was hoping to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It stirred me emotionally,'' said Nomcebo Mkhize of Durban, a
student who has been involved with AIDS issues. While much of the
talk surrounding the conference has been about getting expensive
and complex drugs to poor nations, she was pleased to hear Mandela
focus more on the human dimension of the disease, and the need to
embrace people who are suffering with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   And she said his endorsement of programs to cut transmission of
the virus from mothers to infants will carry a lot of weight with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Daynese Santos, a physician's assistant at the Grady Infectious
Disease Center in Atlanta, said she and others wept during portions
of the speech.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     GOP TURNS UP HEAT ON HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attacks in the U.S. Senate campaign are
escalating as Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton finds
herself described as a ``polarizing and power-hungry'' politician
who ``isn't telling it straight'' about her opponent's health care
record.
</P>
<P>
   A television advertisement released Thursday by her rival,
Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, and a fund-raising letter from the
state Republican Committee turned up the heat in the campaign
against the first lady, who condemned the negativity and pledged to
focus on issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second advertisement from Lazio's campaign marked the
softer of the two attacks on Clinton. In it, a woman speaks to the
camera to defend Lazio's congressional voting record on health care
bills _ a focal point of Clinton's own campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but Mrs. Clinton's campaign isn't telling it
straight about Rick Lazio and health care,'' the woman says in the
ad. ``... Rick voted for a Patients' Bill of Rights and Rick just
helped pass new legislation to help seniors afford their
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I care so much about health care? I'm a registered
nurse. And how do I know so much about Rick Lazio? He's my
husband,'' says the woman, Patricia Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio voted against a bipartisan measure popularly known as the
Patients' Bill of Rights that aims to protect patients from
receiving substandard care from managed-care companies. Lazio voted
for a competing bill that basically aimed to provide health
coverage for uninsured workers _ which he says is a better
protection for New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The assault by state GOP Chairman Bill Powers was more pointed.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising letter, sent to ``common-sense conservatives''
nationwide, calls Clinton ``abrasive and annoying, brash and
bitter, calculating and scheming, distant and deceitful, polarizing
and power hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers stood by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country knows the Clintons will do and say anything
to win and we also all know she's only using New York as a stepping
stone to the White House,'' Powers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning in New York City, responded: ``I guess this
is going to be their strategy, to hurl insults instead of talk
about issues.''

MAY I ASK, IS THERE A GUN AT HOME? 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   An Indiana mother and doctor who
is worried about kids and guns proposed an intriguing idea on
National Public Radio. She thinks parents ought to ask their
friends and neighbors if they keep guns in the house.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her reasoning is sound. Parents have a general right to be nosy
where their kids are concerned, and usually they don't hold back.
We have no trouble asking if there is a fence around the swimming
pool where our child goes to play. Or if the dog's a biter and if
there's a parent at home after school. Parents make pretty good
sleuths. We can tell you which households allow diet sodas, Barbie
dolls and too much TV.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you ask about guns?
</P>
<P>
   How about: ``I was wondering if you keep a gun at your house. I
worry about kids and guns and just want to make sure there's no way
my little Evan can get his hands on one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a horribly important and relevant question, one most
parents would understand. So, why does it make us squirm?
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns? I still don't know how to ask another mom if she
believes in video games,'' says the mother of a kindergartner.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too personal, she says. She could ask about guns at a
day care center, but she couldn't of a friend or neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we shy about guns? We're only speculating about the
impact of video games and TV shows on children. But we know for
sure what happens when real guns and kids get together.
</P>
<P>
   If we knew the neighbor kept a pet python we wouldn't be afraid
to ask if it was in its cage when the kids were around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are up there with politics and religion,'' says one
father. He doesn't own a gun but his sister, who works in law
enforcement, does. The two also part on the matter of toy guns for
their children. ``It's one of those subjects you don't bring up if
you know you're going to disagree,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An open and neighborly discussion about guns and gun safety
would certainly advance the issue more than Congress or any
presidential candidate has. There really is no enemy. The motive is
not to out the gun owners of America, make them put little decals
on their front windows saying ``Gun in house.'' We just want to
keep kids from killing themselves and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we balk because we have these prejudices. If you ask
someone about their swimming pool it's not a judgment thing. But if
you ask if they keep guns it feels accusatory.
</P>
<P>
   In communities where hunting and guns are commonplace, you could
probably bring up the subject naturally. It's different in
suburbia. You don't think about guns and suburbia. Yet, that's
where gun sales are up. Somebody's got to have them.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know who has a gun in your circle of friends? I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Another mother, who has a four-year-old, says, ``I know the
houses where my son goes to play. I assume his friends' parents are
like us. I feel we're aligned in our thinking. I don't have a gun
and so I naturally expect they don't either. But that may not be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   You also want to be able to trust another parent to keep your
child safe. And that's true whether or not they have a pistol in
the shoe box on the top shelf.
</P>
<P>
   This woman's son returned one day from visiting a neighbor's and
said he didn't want to go back because the other children were
playing ``Army,'' and as he told his mother, ``We don't do that in
our family.'' The mother's in a quandary because in explaining her
son's discomfort to the other family she doesn't want to sound like
she's insulting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to them about it but I don't want to get into
a big NRA discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over gun control has made everyone jumpy and
both sides have become so demonized by the other that it's hard to
get any serious discussion going. Yet, in between the adamant
anti-gun people and passionate pro-gun people are a lot of others
who must be capable of discussing guns without feeling personally
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   You'd like to think that if a gun owner were asked to assure
well-meaning parents that his weapons were safe from their child he
would. As well, you'd like to think that if a family found out
their well-meaning neighbor owned a gun, they wouldn't consider his
house a bad risk.
</P>
<P>
   As for parents not wanting to ask embarrassing questions on
behalf of their kids, get used to it.

Georgia has been an exception, accoridng to a 10-year study by the

the 1998-99 school year, thanks to a four-year run of 6 percent pay

   VOTERS _ WASHINGTON Voters are more disengaged in the

lower than it was in 1996, when only 49 percent of eligible
citizens cast ballots, the first time in more than 70 years that
less than half of voters went to the polls. Yet despite voter
apathy, Americans say they are more satisified with their choice of
presidential candidates this year and they are less critical of the
way the campaigns are being conducted, the survey found. The poll
concluded that the race between Democrat Al Gore and Republican
George W. Bush remains wide open as each candidate heads to his

the hierarchy of his clan never entered his mind. But the prospect
of selecting a female to the lofty position of AME bishop could not
escape the minds of the 1,800 delegates who attended the order's
closely scrutinized General Conference at the Cincinnati Convention
Center this week. In a landmark, second-ballot vote, the Rev.

&HT;     FOR WHOM THE BRIDGE TOLLS

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Golden Gate Bridge's new FasTrak system got
off on the slow track Thursday morning. Guys were handing out
brochures explaining how to sign up for the electronic toll system,
which was nice, but it caused a bit of a traffic backup.
</P>
<P>
   I was taken aback by some of the fine print in the brochure,
which was harder to read than the average VCR manual.
</P>
<P>
   One clause stood out: ``You agree to . . . obey all traffic laws
and regulations. . . . You also agree to obey all posted speed
limits on all FasTrak toll facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Agree to obey the speed limits? This will be hard for some folks
who drive the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   That clause may be important. According to Mary Currie of the
Golden Gate Bridge District, FasTrak transponders have the
capability to record who is speeding on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: They're all driving SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the transponders can't be used to nail speeders without
legislative approval, and that may be hard to get. You know how
fast legislators want to get to San Francisco from Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Another Big Brother question: Will transponder records be used
against people like cell phone records and e-mail? ``John Doe
claims he spent the whole weekend in Novato, but his transponder
says he went to San Francisco Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   John Doe should pay cash, or the bridge will toll for him.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal note, I hope all the Golden Gate Bridge toll
takers come through this OK. They are the greatest people in the
world, at least in three-second interactions. Transponders can't
smile and make your morning.

   In other sports news, golfers are upset because Stanford wants
to get rid of the first hole at the Stanford Golf Course to build
student and faculty housing. What is the controversy here? Is this
a university or a country club?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's both. But what's wrong with losing just one hole?
Golfers still will have 17 left. They shave strokes. They can shave
holes, too.

   All morning Thursday CNN was rerunning the video of a dozen
Philadelphia cops kicking and hitting a suspect. What a mess. The
cops were kicking and shoving each other in order to get at the
guy. No wonder he got away the first time the cops tried to pin him
down.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Philly cops kick and beat a guy who shot one of their
own, bit another and stole a police car? Yes, people are actually
asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   One city official said it wasn't anything like the Rodney King
case because black and white cops both piled on this guy. It was an
equal opportunity melee, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how dumb these cops were to let a suspect
get away, steal a squad car and maybe a cop's gun _ and then go
berserk while a news helicopter was overhead.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear rotors, guys, smile and say cheese steak.

IN THIS ERA, LEWIS IS RIGHT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The man of war is at peace now.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 48 hours, Lennox Lewis will defend the undisputed
heavyweight title in his hometown, his first appearance in a London
boxing ring since he lost a portion of that title to one right hand
from a footnote in history named Oliver McCall.
</P>
<P>
   He will fight for the last time in front of a less-than-packed
house at the London Arena, a baffling situation considering it has
been more than 100 years since a son of England held the undisputed
title. Yet while his manager, Frank Maloney, vents, and his
promoter, Panos Eliades, frets over the way his fighter is viewed
in his own land, Lennox Lewis remains a sea of calm.
</P>
<P>
   Though arguably the greatest heavyweight in English history, his
popularity is dwarfed still by great British losers such as Henry
Cooper and Frank Bruno, men who fought with honor but without
anywhere near the ability, dominance or success of Lewis. Still,
English fight fans remain diffident toward Lewis, an odd contrast
to the mania in the streets just six months ago when Mike Tyson
first appeared in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, Lewis has little time left to make his point to his own
people and has apparently given up trying. He knows, it seems, what
few fighters ever realize. He knows his strength must come from
within . . . and so it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era, Lennox Lewis reigns supreme,'' the World Boxing
Council, International Boxing Federation, and International Boxing
Association title holder said several days before Saturday's fight
with Frans Botha. ``In the past era, Muhammad Ali reigned supreme.
Joe Louis reigned supreme. Each era brings along a different boxer
who stands out. I believe I stand out in this era. (Evander)
Holyfield and Tyson stand out for different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice the conqueror of Holyfield, although their first fight was
declared a controversial draw, Lewis believes Holyfield's place
comes from his skill, heart, and dominance of a big man's sport
despite having a small man's body. Tyson's place, he says, is
obvious, but it has less to do with his boxing skill than with the
public nightmare of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's place, however, is with Dempsey and Louis and Ali,
because ``I'm a big heavyweight in an era of big heavyweights who
has done what I've done and made it look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate where he ranks among today's heavyweights,
the champion hesitated not for a moment. ``Head and shoulders
above,'' he said. ``Definitely head and shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   While many still feel Lewis has never become the fighter his
trainer, Emanuel Steward, believes he could be, no one can deny
Lewis is a two-time heavyweight champion and the undisputed
title-holder, despite a World Boxing Association decision to take
its title from him for political and business reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing, he destroyed a vastly overrated Michael
Grant in two rounds only because there was a brave referee in the
ring who let the fight go that long. He has twice handled Holyfield
with relative ease, the smaller man's size being as much of a
factor as Lewis's skills.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis is content to accept, he is what he is. And as John L.
Sullivan once boasted, Lewis believes he's a guy who can lick
anyone in the house (as Sullivan once announced in a Boston bar),
although Lewis would never mention that in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think like that because I know that,'' Lewis said.
``I'm a professional fighter. In the ring that's what I believe,
but I don't need to say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my moment in time. There is nobody out there who can
match my skills. The proper matchup would have been with Riddick
Bowe, but he fell by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowe had been Lewis's rival since the gold- medal fight at the
Seoul Olympics in 1988. Lewis dominated that day and believed he
would again after Bowe first won the heavyweight title from
Holyfield in the best fight of his life. But from that moment, Bowe
began to dissipate, mostly from his own mishandling of his training
and his approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe's career fell far short of the promise it once held for
both men, the promise of several titanic matchups between two huge
heavyweights of similar skills. That those fights never happened,
Lewis believes, robbed him of his place in history in the eyes of
his critics, but it also proved what he had always knew about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I'd be the last man standing,'' Lewis said.
``It's come to that. Once I would have said Holyfield would give me
a tough fight but he wasn't big enough. Look at all the big guys.
Grant wasn't tough enough. Tyson? I look at Tyson as a has-been
who's a few bricks shy of a load. He's plateaued off. His best days
are really gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he's got to contend with is his name and his
power. The only way he could hurt me is if I stuck my chin out, and
he definitely could hit it and hurt me. But I'm a pugilist
specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no such thing would happen with Tyson, and hence
the Big Man would beat down the little man and destroy him the way
George Foreman did to Joe Frazier when it was first Foreman's time.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mythical matchup with Bowe, who is believed to have
brain damage, Lewis looks at the tatters of a fallen champion and
sees what he says the world did not when the two were rivals. He
sees now what would have beaten Bowe even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was mentally stronger,'' Lewis said. ``I knew I was
physically stronger as well. He may have been a better technical
boxer at the time because he grew up in New York and sparred with
pros when he was an amateur and he had a great trainer (Eddie
Futch), but I would have beaten him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel cheated I wasn't able to knock some of the stuffing
out of him. Riddick Bowe insulted me a couple times. I definitely
wanted him in the ring but every time he insulted me there were
1,000 people to stop us. Rock Newman (Bowe's manager) did a great
job keeping him away and blowing smoke signals saying I didn't want
to fight him.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a contented man revealed for a brief moment a
light side which, if seen more often both here and abroad, might
well have made him a more popular champion. He was asked what he
had learned from Bowe's sad fall, and without hesitation replied,
``It's very important not to keep a frig in the (bed)room. I'm more
seriously inclined then he was. He was a big kid.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to Bowe's horrible training habits, laziness,
and weight problems, which combined to bring him down before Lewis
had the chance to put him down. But unknowingly, it was also a
reference to the fact Lewis is the heavyweight champion of his era
because he has survived all challengers. He is, as he said, the
last man standing, a man with no real challenge ahead before his
era ends.
</P>
<P>
   And when it does, Steward believes, Lennox Lewis may not leave
as the people's champion even in his own country, but he will leave
as something more important than that. He will leave a contented
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox, you have to understand, has complete internal peace,''
Steward said. ``He has no demons. Lennox genuinely believes he
never dodged anybody who was willing to meet him. Only the guys who
threw away championship belts to avoid him (Bowe and Tyson) have
escaped, and that in itself is fulfilling because it showed him
their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox will never place himself in a position of getting back
in the ring to take a terrible beating the way Joe Louis did
against Rocky Marciano, the way Ali did against Larry Holmes or
(Sugar) Ray (Leonard) did against Terry Norris and Hector Camacho.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he goes, he'll be gone and he'll remain gone. And history
will be kind in its judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as kind, if not more so, than the champion will be in his
own judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely in my place in history,'' Lewis said. ``I've
accomplished my goals and aspirations and I still have my
faculties. I may be a little scathed, but I'm unmarked.''

BLUE JAYS ARE THE FORGOTTEN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim McCarver readily admits he made a mistake. The Fox baseball
analyst ``somehow'' forgot to mention the Toronto Blue Jays when he
predicted at the beginning of the season that the American League
East would be a close race between the Yankees and Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant to include the Blue Jays,'' he deadpanned. ``I knew
they would be good and they actually looked better last year. But
now they look like they will be a force to contend with in the AL
East.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight is always better. But McCarver is still sticking with
the Red Sox to make the AL East a two-way, err, a three-way race
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox aren't going away,'' McCarver said. ``They didn't
age overnight. They still are potentially a better team than last
year. There's too much baseball left to play to rule out any of
those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver will call Saturday's Red Sox game against the New York
Mets. Though Ramon Martinez is pitching, McCarver's question is
about his brother. ``How's Pedro?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said that Pedro ``fuels so many other elements of the
team's offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The big story is the return of Mike Piazza. McCarver said that
the Mets catcher will be able to shake off the cobwebs from a Roger
Clemens pitch that hit Piazza's head. McCarver was more concerned
by the effect all the hoopla will have on Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside pitching has been a sensitive issue for as long as I
can remember,'' McCarver said. ``All the great ones were accused _
Bob Gibson, Gaylord Perry, Don Drysdale. And the story wasn't blown
out of proportion. It deserved coverage because it was Clemens and
Piazza. But if I'm Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees pitching coach, I'd
tell Clemens to pitch inside right away. If Clemens doesn't come
right back in there, like he should and is his right, then he will
give hitters a tremendous advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said he didn't want to get into whether Clemens
intentionally hit Piazza. ``The bigger issue is whether Clemens can
get back up there and throw inside. He should not be deterred
because that side of the plate is as much his as it is the
hitters'. The problem has become incendiary because not enough
pitchers do it. You show me a pitcher who doesn't pitch inside and
I'll show you a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, Pedro Martinez has hit 11 batters this
season, Clemens six.
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said that he has seen Ramon Martinez pitch twice
against the Yankees and he has looked good each time. ``His arm
won't allow him to do the things that he did when he was with the
Dodgers,'' McCarver said. ``But he is intelligent enough to make
the changes. He has lowered his sights a little and is not throwing
the high riding fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said he doesn't believe in the Curse of the Bambino.
``The fact of the matter is that (the Red Sox) haven't won since
1918,'' McCarver said. ``I don't believe in all of that curse
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1986 World Series loss to the Mets made him rethink his
reliance on facts. ``I was in the box with Nelson Doubleday, the
owner of the Mets, and was shaking his hand congratulating him on
the Series and telling him that maybe in a year or two the Mets
could win the whole thing and then Buckner flubs the ball,''
McCarver said. ``I just couldn't figure it out.''

McDonough retires

<P>
   Will McDonough, the Boston Globe sports columnist and former NFL
analyst with CBS and NBC, has retired from the Globe. McDonough was
a member of management and subject to the company's policy of
mandatory retirement at age 65. It is expected that McDonough will
still write for the Globe from time to time. . . . ESPN's coverage
of the All-Star Game's Home Run Derby dropped 24 percent in
television ratings. Monday night's slugfest earned a 5.73 cable
rating, down from last year's 7.51 rating. The All-Star Game also
suffered from the lack of big-name players. Ratings dropped 16
percent to 10.1 and 18 share. The game still was the most-watched
prime time program. Boston viewers gave NBC an 11.8 rating and 21
share.

It's Miller time
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When ABC hired Dennis Miller to be an analyst on ``Monday Night
Football'', no one expected HBO to receive as much free advertising
as it did. Everything from newspaper stories and the cover of
Sports Illustrated blared Miller's and HBO's name.
</P>
<P>
   It's now getting even better for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   HBO brass told reporters this week that Miller will be free to
plug his HBO show on the air at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-promotion was part of the deal between HBO and ABC.
HBO had exclusive TV dibs on Miller for HBO's ``The Dennis Miller
Show.'' Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming,
said he received assurances from the ``highest levels'' that
Miller's HBO talker would be plugged. An ABC Sports spokesman said
that the plugging will be confined to identifying Miller as an HBO
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this was a great opportunity for Dennis,'' Albrecht
said. ``When was the last time you saw Dennis on the cover of
Sports Illustrated?''

IT'S APPLET PICKING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: A friend somehow entered a Web site that took
over his Internet Explorer 5, locking him into a revolving series
of pornographic sites. Closing one window opened another.
Additionally, the IE5 toolbar was hidden in all browser windows.
Opening another browser window simply loaded the original porno
site and began the chain of sites again. _ Vicious Cycle
</P>
<P>
   Dear Vicious: Gee, it's difficult to imagine that a smut peddler
would resort to such devious behavior just to sell dirty pictures.
Most of the pornographers I hang out with are really swell guys.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who's been snookered into visiting a porn site knows
what you're talking about. The sites take over the browser and
won't turn it loose: You have no choice but to look at all those
naked pictures of Rosie O'Donnell, again and again. Scary thought,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Small programs called ``applets'' can be included in the Web
page source code, where most people would never think to look for
them. Some can change your home page without asking, others call up
new browser windows when you attempt to close a page, and some can
remove all the toolbars, menus and buttons so you're left with
nothing but a full-screen ad that you have no way to get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   You can fight back, though. When I get one of those full-screen
dealies, I hit Control-Alt-Delete to display the list of running
programs, then knock the offending one off. You may have to do that
a dozen times before you get rid of all the crud, though. You can
also try closing the windows as quickly as you can: Sometimes you
can catch them before the applet kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   The only real defense is to shut off your browser's ability to
run these little hand grenades. In the Security tab of IE5's
Internet Options, you can customize the settings by disabling
``active scripting'' and ``Java applets.'' There are similar
click-boxes in Netscape's preferences. Look under ``Advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also try a program like AdSubtract (www.adsubtract.com)
that can block not only those nasty little scripts, but also the
banner ads that clutter up almost every page you look at these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if you turn off scripting, gizmos on nonporn pages
aren't going to work either. It's a small price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: About two months ago, my well-behaved computer
started putting blank boxes in my task bar. I assume they indicated
closed programs, but how can I get them to not appear after the
programs are closed? _ Annoyed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Annoyed: Sorry, there's still no answer to this one. A few
months back, something _ and nobody has figured out what _ affected
thousands of Windows 98 machines. Maybe it was a Windows update,
maybe a new virus signature file, maybe some upgrade to something
that a lot of people use.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it causes little phantom buttons to remain on
the task bar after a program ends. You can click on them to make
them go away, but that's not really a solution.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect it's just another plot to make us run out and buy the
replacement for Windows 98, irritatingly named Windows Me, if it
ever makes it past quality control. Oh boy! A whole new set of
bugs! At least it's job security for me.
</P>
<P>
   (If it wasn't for Microsoft, Dr. Emilio Bombay probably would
have returned to the food-service industry years ago. Instead, he
offers occasionally accurate answers about most things electronic.

DISNEY SOLUTION TO TOYSMART PRIVACY ISSUE QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co., majority owner of Toysmart.com, seemed to
emerge as a savior this week when it offered to buy and then
``retire'' the bankrupt online retailer's customer data.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates are skeptical of Disney's plans. Some say
they fear Disney will somehow use the information it has
``retired.'' Others say Toysmart.com's customer files should die
with the company. Permitting the sale at all, they argue, would
send the message that failed Internet retailers can auction off
confidential data they had promised to keep in-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Disney has the right intentions,'' said Dave Steer, a
spokesman for TRUSTe, a San Jose, Calif., company that offers a
privacy-seal program. ``But it sets a bad precedent for a knight in
shining armor to come in and save the day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission sued the Waltham, Mass.
toy retailer in US District Court in Boston, attempting to block
the company from selling consumer information it had promised to
keep under wraps. Toysmart.com had put the data up for sale to help
satisfy creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also attracted the attention of several lawmakers,
including US Representative William D. Delahunt, a Democrat of
Massachusetts, who have proposed legislation to protect the privacy
of customers of online retailers that break privacy promises.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's lawsuit pits the interests of privacy advocates
against those of creditors, who hope to get repaid from the sale of
Toysmart.com's assets. Internet customer data can command a high
price if it contains a large number of repeat buyers and extensive
information about their preferences, online retailers said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Toysmart.com's attorneys have been trying to
negotiate a settlement with federal regulators in which the company
can sell the data to a family-oriented Web site. Any buyer must be
approved by a US bankruptcy judge in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates hope the courts will block the sale,
forcing online retailers to stick to their promises to the very
end.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's proposal, they said, offers a quick solution but does
not address the issue of what happens to valuable customer data
once a dot-com fails _ a problem that is expected to grow as Web
businesses face stronger competition and more investor scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that these online privacy policies have no
teeth,'' said Andrew Shen, a policy analyst with the Electronic
Privacy Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chis Kelley, an analyst with Forrester Research, noted that
Disney did not define ``retire,'' raising questions over its future
use. ``That's troublesome to me, and I'm sure, troublesome to
consumers,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokeswoman said the database would not be used and
customer confidentiality would be assured. But she would not say
whether customer files would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone takes a hard line against the sale of customer
data. Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the monthly newsletter
Privacy Journal in Rhode Island, said he sees nothing wrong with
selling customer information under certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Courts, he said, can require companies to contact all customers
and offer them the option to have their information deleted from
files.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog companies, retail chains and marketers routinely swap
and purchase customer lists. But privacy advocates are more alarmed
by the gathering of customer data on the Internet, which allows for
more extensive collection on individuals' shoppping preferences,
hobbies, and even ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most rudimentary e-commerce sites gather and store
information such as customers' names, e-mail addresses, home
addresses and purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Like other online retailers, Toysmart.com had asked customers to
provide personal information such as their children's names and
birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   But though Toysmart.com had received high ratings from
consumers, it did not manage to please its investors. The Web site
closed in May after Disney, which had invested $20 million in the
firm, pulled its support. A month later, Toysmart.com filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy
Code.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet merchant's plans to sell personal information
emerged shortly after its collapse. In June, the company advertised
the sale of its customer list and other assets in the Wall Street
Journal. Around the same time, several local retailers said they
received solicitations from Toysmart.com representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have rallied in Toysmart.com's support. Even the
Direct Marketing Association, which represents thousands of catalog
companies, online retailers and marketers, has shied away from
supporting the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate entity is Toysmart, and Toysmart said it would
not share its list of customers,'' said Stephen Altobelli, a
spokesman for the industry group. ``Therefore, it should not.''
</P>
<P>
   Both off-line and online, consumers should assume that
information about their information has migrated to new and
unexpected places, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jeffrey Steinberg, chief marketing officer for
MotherNature.com, was working for NetGrocer.com when a failed
Internet grocer asked him if he'd like to purchase customer data,
he said. He said he passed because he believed the price was too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Recent failures like Toysmart.com, Boo.com and CraftShop.com
have attracted more attention because they have tried to sell
consumer information despite promises that they would not do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other Web sites display pages and pages of privacy
statements that seem to stump even company officials. Shoppers at
Reel.com, for example, are told that the online seller of
videotapes has a new relationship with Buy.com. That means Buy.com
has access to information on new Reel.com customers.
</P>
<P>
   Things get more muddled when it comes to Reel.com's old customer
list. Hollywood Entertainment Corp., Reel.com's parent company,
recently folded the ailing Internet retailer into its own
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Entertainment, owner of the Hollywood Video chain,
promises not look at Reel.com's customer data, company spokesman
Sean Mahoney said. But it reserves the right to send promotional
information to Reel.com, which can pass it on to its consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is ridiculous,'' analyst Kelley said. ``Basically, these
companies seem to be looking at ways to use this data.''
</P>
<P>
   One organization is especially displeased with the liberties
online retailers have taken. It's TRUSTe, which allows its Web
members to display privacy seals if they adhere to certain
guidelines. The industry watchdog alerted federal regulators to
Toysmart.com's situation and is taking a closer look at its
customer list, which also includes Reel.com and Boo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is now on Toysmart,'' said TRUSTe's Steer.
``Undoubtedly, others will emerge.''

IF I'M BUSH, I'M SMILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I'm George W., I'm a happy camper four months out.
</P>
<P>
   I'm cooking on all burners and that Tex-Mex barbecue is smoking.
It's almost time for the Five Alarm Chili sauce. That'll come in
Philadelphia at the convention just two weeks ahead. I can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is fumbling around with his
let's-try-this-theme-today-and-keep-trying-till-hit-one-that-works.
There's some polling daylight between me and him _ I can say me and
him even though I went to Andover and Yale and Harvard Business
School _ and all my experts tell me I'm gonna have a lot happier
convention than Al will. And I get to go first.
</P>
<P>
   I had a pretty darn good week. Raised some more cash _ we'll go
over $100 million in a matter of days _ and that's not even
counting the federal subsidy that kicks in. I'll smother Gore on TV
the rest of the summer, but only in those states where I'm
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   I have to smile and grin and say ``You're gosh darn right we'll
contest California and New York.'' But no way we'll blow any
significant slice of our stake on those sure loser states. And I
just hope Gore's crowd is dumb enough to think they can do any
business in Texas or Florida. Go ahead, boys, make my day. Spend
some of your dwindling bundle on those two states. Hah!
</P>
<P>
   We've got our convention wired. My people say we won't have
anywhere near the trouble in the streets the Democrats are facing
in Los Angeles. God, I hope those people who were rioting in
Seattle will show up tanned and rested for LA. Philadelphia should
be a cakewalk by comparison. Those hundred demonstrators who dogged
Gore's headquarters in Nashville are just a taste of what Old Al
has waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   My people have done everything right for our little shindig. No
former presidents giving speeches _ no Gerry Ford, no Gipper, not
even my dad. That should help quash this ``dynasty'' bull. I'll
just wave to Mom and Pop up there in the gallery; the TV will love
that.
</P>
<P>
   And our people are under orders: no whining about the shrinking
major network coverage. We don't need that, the Democrats do. We're
happy if we just have a totally-controlled environment. Let the
C-Span and CNN junkies nibble away at this and that. Our paid
advertising will swamp Gore's, and the less network TV exposure his
crowd gets, the better for us.
</P>
<P>
   We think there's a pretty good chance the Democrats' show will
feature a lot of rock-tossing and street fights between the
demonstrators and the LA cops. That'll help us bigtime if it's
anywhere even half of what Chicago '68 was.
</P>
<P>
   I've gotta admit I caught some breaks. John McCain took us over
the coals pretty good back in February and March. But he's calmed
down, and the way he's going around making speeches for Republican
candidates, he's helping us tremendously. Gore got nothing out of
Bill Bradley these last four months. No love lost there, I guess.
Well, McCain and I ain't exactly buddies either. But I got a heck
of a lot more out of McCain's endorsement than Gore will get from
Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   My ``compassionate conservative'' pitch has legs. I got a decent
reception at the NAACP convention. I know there's no votes there
for me. But the picture was worth millions in free advertising, me
and the black folks, and them being so polite and applauding some.
Bob Dole was dumb to skip their convention four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's like my handlers keep stressing to me, keep reaching out,
it's crucial you be presented as a reach-out guy, not a
shut-the-door Republican. And it's working. I sort of figure that I
start out with 40 percent of the vote, and Gore starts out with 40
percent of the vote, and then we scrap over the 20 percent that's
left. And how we get 11 of that 20, or 12 of it, is what the deal
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking at New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois,
and Ohio _ God, I'd give anything to get Ohio. I get three of those
five, they tell me I'm home free, when you figure I've got a lock
on Texas and Florida and the mountain states and most of the South.
I'll have to decide within the next week who's going to be No. 2 on
my ticket.
</P>
<P>
   All those media types keep talking up McCain. He'll be lucky. I
think Old John-Boy is just a tad too frisky for my tastes, all that
public financing baloney, and running off at the mouth about
pork-barrel politics. I'm trying to find a reason not to pick Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania. He's a popular governor, big in the party,
he's a Vietnam war hero.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wingers will get all worked up because he's prochoice.
But he's only barely prochoice. I can sell him to the convention
without too much trouble. And he's a Catholic. That's huge in those
five battleground states. So let the prolifers rant and rave;
they've got nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is barely on the horizon. Right now Ralph Nader
looks like he takes more from Gore in the states where trade is an
issue with labor than Pat takes from me in the heartland. I'll take
that swap any day.
</P>
<P>
   So I just keep my fingers crossed that no scandal pops up that
we didn't anticipate. I'll have to do tolerably well in the
debates, but I can handle that. There's no doubt going to be some
more shootouts that will bring the gun business up all over again.
And the crowd yapping about the death penalty will be outside every
rally I hold. But if I had to choose between my problems and
Gore's, I'd take mine every time.

`X-MEN' WITHOUT SOULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
X-MEN 
Directed by: Bryan Singer 
Screenplay by: David Hayter 
Starring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke
Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Tyler Mane, Ray
Park, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Bruce Davison 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: R (sci-fi action violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ``Blade Runner'' wannabes go, ``X-Men'' is OK, but not much
more. It lacks the tragic grandeur and psychic punch to go with its
stygian visuals. Expecting more may be asking too much. It may be
unfair to find fault with a comic-book movie that stays only
comic-book deep, tries to get most of the details right, but
settles for a screenful of good mutants/bad mutants stuff. Still,
``Blade Runner'' showed us that the alienation forced on its
androids could imbue them with a tragic nobility. The pain and
alienation forced on the mutants in ``X-Men'' by a frightened
humanity that wants to outlaw them, apart from being a barely
veiled comment on bigotry and racism, takes them only as far as
basic good guy/bad guy stuff, but with better toys.
</P>
<P>
   After playing a few villains recently, Patrick Stewart shifts
back into his Picard mode to play psychic Xavier, the wise old
headmaster of the good mutants who decide to take the high road and
not retaliate against the humans who fear the mutants'
extraordinary powers. The film does a scrupulous job of
transferring to the screen the laser vision of Cyclops (James
Marsden), the meteorological clout of Storm (Halle Berry), the
telekinetic telepath of Jean Gray (Famke Janssen) whose powers are
second only to Xavier's, and the energy-transferring talents of
Rogue (Anna Paquin). In a powerful prologue out of ``Schindler's
List,'' we can at least understand why the bad mutant, Ian
McKellen's Magneto, isn't too keen on humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The plot's mainspring is Magneto's
let's-get-them-before-they-get-us policy. This involves making war
on so-called normal people, starting with Bruce Davison's
reactionary senator, who wants to pass laws clamping down on the
mutants and rendering them second-class citizens. Magneto's posse
consists of the brawny Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), the
retractable-tongued Toad (Ray Park), and the shape-changing
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). They're pretty evenly matched,
and the tech wizards have outdone themselves in giving shape to the
respective underground lairs _ sleekly metallic and rational in
Xavier's case, stonily elemental in Magneto's.
</P>
<P>
   Of more interest to fans will be the news that the designers
have earned their money when it came to fashioning Wolverine's
retractable metal alloy claws, Toad's whiplash cable tongue, and
Mystique's morphing abilities. There is an attempt to portray the
conflicts eating at Wolverine and Rogue. I wish there had been more
of one and that the film explored character more deeply. Certainly
the potential is there, and without this resonance, ``X-Men''
recedes to a string of mere action exploits. These are proficiently
executed but, for all their visual authority, not much more than
routine.
</P>
<P>
   The real imagination in ``X-Men'' lies in the conception of the
characters, and one can't help wishing that the film had taken more
of a stab at locating their souls as well as their various bags of
tricks. ``X-Men'' could have been a lot worse. But neither is it
the film it could have been _ an issue of ongoing relevance since
``X-Men'' ends by setting up a sequel with everything but a release
date.

IT'S A LONG HAUL TO FAME FOR NAVRATILOVA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The name Agnes Semanska does not appear in
Martina Navratilova's seemingly endless resume of victories across
the globe. ``But it's important,'' says Martina. ``It was my first
big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody watched or cared but the two of them. ``I was 11,''
Navratilova said. ``Anna Semanska was my dear grandmother. She had
been a very good player as a young woman, and had a win over Vera
Sukova, who would be a Wimbledon finalist (1962). When I finally
beat her, after a lot of trying, I thought I was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good,'' of course, became great _ the greatest in this
view. Her life has been a long-running drama on an
adventurously-traveled road. It wound from that crimson dirt patch
and the village of Revnice outside of Prague through all the major
championships (nine Wimbledons), the celebrated duels with Chris
Evert, castigation and non-personhood in her native Czechoslovakia,
and arrives at the doorstep of the International Tennis Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova will be anointed Saturday on the lawn of Newport's
Casino in the company of Australian Mal Anderson and another
American, Judge Robert Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   They called the slim 6-foot-1-inch Anderson ``Cowboy.'' He not
only looked the part but was the genuine article. Coming off a
40,000-acre Queensland ranch, Mal was more at home on a horse than
the homemade tennis court his family built from the grit of
knocked-over termite mounds. After dealing with angry bulls and
being thrown from saddles, tennis was pretty tame. But he went at
it like a raging mustang (though with Gary Cooperish demeanor),
galloping to the net and volleying fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's was the style of two other Queensland ruralists
who've preceded him into the Hall _ Rod Laver and Roy Emerson _ and
made him the first to win the US Championship unseeded in 1957. His
path went through the 2-3-1 seeds Dick Savitt, Sven Davidson, and
countryman Ashley Cooper. Three months later, he led Australia to
the Davis Cup over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But his best years were spent in the obscurity of the pro tour,
roaming with the distinguished outlaws who were banned from the
established circuit until open tennis dawned in 1968. Five years
after that, at 38, he helped the Aussies win another Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kelleher, a federal judge in Los Angeles over the last 30
years, was instrumental in the monumental 1968 breakthrough that
unified the game under the banner of tennis open to pros as well as
amateurs, and sent it skyrocketing. As one of the few enlightened
and visionary presidents of the US Tennis Association, he pushed
for opens, along with the British, against much opposition at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He was determined to make the inaugural US Open splashy by
offering an unheard-of pot, $ 100,000 total for all events. ``I
didn't know where we'd get the money,'' he said with a laugh,
recalling how poor the USTA was then. ``But I figured attendance
would go up, and TV would want to join in.'' He took a chance and
was right. Today the USTA, wealthy because of the Open, offers
$800,000 each as male and female first prize, an award that was
$14,000 and $6,000, respectively, in '68.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher, a New Yorker with a New England education (Williams
plus Harvard Law) has played numerous roles in the game, among them
captaincy of the victorious US Davis Cup team in 1963, and winner
of several US titles in senior (over 45) tourneys.
</P>
<P>
   But for titles, and soap operatic twists and turns blending with
competitive verve, few, if any, Hall of Famer measures up to
Martina. Her bold defection from a police state, announced at
Forest Hills just prior to the US Open men's final of 1975,
upstaged Manolo Orantes's huge upset of Jimmy Connors.
</P>
<P>
   For years she was condemned for becoming ``Americanized,''
regarded as nonexistent, her results unpublished in the Communist
land. Nevertheless, Martina went at tennis and life in a headfirst
rush, unafraid to be herself. ``I had to escape Czechoslovakia and
that control to fulfill myself as a player and person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``great wide hope,'' she nearly ate herself out of
business _ then flip-flopped in the pursuit of super-fitness that
set the standard for the women on tour today. Her loves, tabloid
fodder, were never secret. She refused to hide her sexual nature, a
stance that was costly in lost commercial endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   But Martina, the lefty with racket and unconservative outlook,
keeps charging, serving-and-volleying excitingly. On and off the
court. As recently as last week, she was daringly holding her own
in a sweet, brief reprise at her beloved Wimbledon. Attaining the
quarterfinals in doubles, she represented, at 43, more years than
her foes combined: Venus (20) and Serena (18) Williams.
Nevertheless, Martina and Mariaan de Swardt prodded the champs in
their toughest match, taking the only set the Sisters lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something to be on the same court,'' said Venus of the
remarkable tableau. ``Martina still has faster hands than Serena or
me.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be more such cameos from Martina. ``I found I could
still handle myself out there, not be embarrassed _ and it was
marvelous fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of numbers, Navratilova's cover several pages,
detailing the most acquisitive of all professional careers, one
that began in 1973 and supposedly ended in '94. Unimaginable are
her record 167 singles titles (1,438 match wins), 162 doubles
titles (and 8 mixed). Overall this most consummate champ won 56
majors (18 singles, 31 doubles, 7 mixed).
</P>
<P>
   All right, was there one that meant the most?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first Wimbledon in 1978,'' she said. ``There's nothing
like the first. I was losing to Chrissie (Evert), down a set and
4-2, and she hit me in the head with a passing shot. I'd been
playing in a daze of my first Wimbledon final, but that seemed to
wake me up, and I won (2-6, 6-4, 7-5).''
</P>
<P>
   They paused, both laughing at the beanballing, but Evert
remembers, ``It went downhill for me after that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played four more Wimbledon finals,'' says Martina. She won
them all, eye-catchers in the tapestry of the game's most
intriguing rivalry, 80 engagements, Martina finally ahead of her
good friend, 43-37.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina was overweight but eager and gifted when we first met
in '73,'' recalls Evert, who entered the Hall in 1997. ``I was
beating her most of the time, but then she went on the fitness kick
and caught up. She forced me to do the same. We brought out the
best in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her staggering success, Martina missed out on a Grand
Slam. She came closest in 1984, upset in the semis of the
Australian, last of the four majors that year. In a match of
curious connections, she fell to Helena Sukova, who had ballgirled
for her at tourneys in Prague. Helena is the daughter of a
Wimbledon finalist, Vera Sukova, a woman once beaten by Anna
Semanska, the grandmother who was Martina's ``first important
victim.''

DISABILITY ACT'S PROGRESS, LIMITS MARKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the 10th anniversary of a law to end
discrimination against 57 million Americans with disabilities,
advocates claim progress under it has been too slow, businesses
complain the burdens have been too great, and a federal panel says
the Clinton administration's enforcement has been too timid.
</P>
<P>
   All agree the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act has changed
public attitudes and improved access for the disabled. Still,
disability groups are becoming more vocal, impatient, and litigious
as they see the promise of the landmark civil rights law thwarted
by court decisions limiting the definition of disability and
frustrated by spotty compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove, we are going to shove back,'' said
Marc Fiedler, chairman of the Disability Rights Council, a
Washington-based advocacy group that is aggressive in suing alleged
violators of the disabilities law. ``We have tried different
approaches _ nice letters, angry letters _ but now we say to
businesses and employers, `tell it to the judge.' A lawsuit is the
atomic bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler's group recently launched such a suit against Ames
Department Stores, the largest discount retailer in the Northeast.
The class-action lawsuit, which is about to be amended to include
plaintiffs from Massachusetts, alleges the Connecticut-based
company ignored customer complaints for more than a year and has
failed to remove various structural barriers to people in
wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Ames denies the charges. The company is
``committed to making its stores accessible, and since the company
emerged from bankruptcy (in 1992) has spent $8 million or more in
that regard,'' Ames said in a statement. The retailer, which has 35
stores in Massachusetts, also said it had informed the Disabiltiy
Rights Council of remedial steps before the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument from Fiedler and other people with
disabilities that their world has changed dramatically in the
decade since Congress passed the Disabilities Act with bipartisan
enthusiasm, and President Bush, a strong backer, signed the measure
into law on July 26, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of technical guidelines devised to implement the law
have brought wider aisles, lower counters and drinking fountains,
automatic doors, and more accessible restrooms and fitting rooms in
retail stores. Many restaurants and hotels have installed ramps and
more elevators to accommodate disabled guests. Supermarkets have
more handicapped parking spaces and fewer ``cart corrals'' that
block wheelchair access to entrances. Movie theaters have listening
devices for deaf people, and 80 percent of public buses now are
equipped with wheelchair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has been marked by some high-profile cases: Golfer
Casey Martin, whose disability prevents him from walking long
distances, successfully sued the PGA tour to allow him to ride in a
golf cart. The US attorney's office in Massachusetts took Friendly
Ice Cream Corp. to court and got the company to agree to remove
access barriers in 704 restaurants in 15 states. The court also
ordered Friendly's to pay a $50,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a consciousness and awareness of people with
disabilities that is new and absolutely the result of the law that
is out there and that businesses have to deal with,'' said Chai
Feldblum, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who
helped draft the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Office on Disability has just completed its
first state survey since 1995 and found a ``huge leap forward'' in
the access of disabled people to city and town halls, schools, and
to the ``mainstream of life'' according to Lorraine Greiff,
director of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before ADA, if you told a municipality or business that they
had to do something for disabled people, they would laugh in your
face,'' Greiff said. ``Now they don't fight you _ they know they
have an obligation under the law. Does it take longer than you
would like to accomplish it? Yes. And we're certainly not at 100
percent. But it is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the disabled from public assistance to jobs, one of the
big political selling points of the legislation, has been slow,
officials agree, and claims of employment discrimination have been
harder than expected to prove since the Supreme Court ruled last
year that anyone with a correctable condition, such as poor
eyesight or high-blood pressure, cannot sue an employer under the
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report issued last month to mark the law's
anniversary, the National Council on Disability, an independent
federal agency, said the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's
``muddled positions'' and lack of leadership in pursuing
employment-discrimination cases under the ADA may have contributed
to the ``adverse climate . . . which eventually culminated in
Supreme Court decisions restrictively construing the definition''
of disability.
</P>
<P>
   The council acknowledged that federal enforcement agencies,
including the Justice and Transportation Departments, were
understaffed and underfunded, but it still blamed the Clinton
administration's lack of a ``coherent national strategy'' and ``too
great a concern for potential backlash'' from strong action for
undermining the first decade of the Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years after enactment, it's surprising how routinely this
law is just ignored,'' said Lois Williams, senior counsel for the
Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, which litigates many
disability cases and is coordinating the Ames suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the legislation is ignored because it is so broad and
technical that it is impossible for businesses to interpret and
follow it to the letter. Others believe the law was too vague in
the requirements and timetable for making structures built before
1990 accessible to people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A third explanation is that there are no teeth in the law's
enforcement. To get the business community on board, the act _
unlike other civil rights laws _ was passed without any provision
that businesses found guilty of discrimination would have to pay
damages to injured parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Massachusetts, do provide damages and
that is why the strategy in the Ames case _ filed as the first
federal class-action lawsuit under the act _ is important. If the
case goes forward and Ames loses, the company might have to pay
damages to all the plaintiffs from states where monetary penalties
are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the fear expressed by corporate lobbyists, that the
law's costs would drive businesses to ruin, has not occurred,
according to Randy Johnson, a vice president of the US Chamber of
Commerce. But he contends the situation with ``frivolous'' lawsuits
is getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a simmering anger among some disability-rights groups
who just want to drag people into court, and there is opportunistic
behavior among some attorneys who see this as a way to make some
money,'' said Steven Grover, a vice president of the National
Restaurant Association who oversees the industry's compliance with
the ADA. ``The ADA was designed for access, not to put money in the
pockets of lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chamber of Commerce and the restaurant association are
supporting a bill, recently introduced by GOP Representative Mark
Foley of Florida, that would give businesses 90 days to comply with
the ADA after a complaint has been lodged. Foley says retailers in
Florida and California are being harassed by ``drive-by lawsuits''
initiated by attorneys who find ADA violations and then seek out
people with disabilities to complain about them.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for passage of the bill, which is opposed by the
Clinton administration, are slim. ``Politicians are scared to death
of the disability lobby, and it has taken the position the ADA
should not be amended,'' said Roger Clegg, general counsel of the
Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank. ``Once the
door is cracked, all kinds of bad things might happen to the ADA,
the disability groups say, and they aren't willing to admit there
are any problems with it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Disability Rights Council's Fiedler, a lawyer who was
disabled by a car accident the summer between his sophomore and
junior years at Harvard, the coming anniversary marks 10 years of
vigilance and a commitment to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my perception as a wheelchair user,'' he said,
``we'll have plenty of work to keep us busy for years to come.''

<P>
   PUTNEY, Vt. _ Three hours after landing at Logan International
Airport Thursday morning, John Ferrari and Henry Lloyd of Atlanta
clasped hands on a stranger's back lawn in this bucolic town,
looked each other in the eye, and pledged to remain united for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a few pleasantries with a justice of the peace they
had met five minutes earlier, the two men, wearing tennis shirts
and jeans, got into their rented SUV and whooshed back to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Like the typical Las Vegas wedding, it was just a couple of
out-of-staters getting hitched, with no cake, caterers or weeping
in-laws looking on. But unlike heterosexual newlyweds in Nevada,
when Ferrari and Lloyd's four-minute ceremony ended Thursday, they
knew their bond would not be legally recognized in their distant
home.
</P>
<P>
   So go civil unions in Vermont these days, two weeks after the
state implemented its landmark, controversial law allowing gay and
lesbian couples to live in a state of near-matrimony. According to
town clerks, justices of the peace, and those watching the novel
process unfold, the ``CU'' of Ferrari and Lloyd is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flatlanders,'' as outsiders are called here, constitute the
vast majority of couples who have so far entered into civil unions.
Vermont is the only state that recognizes them as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the ceremonies tend to be minutes-long, bare-bones
affairs, nearly all of which lack the now cliched images Americans
have come to expect when two people come together for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a societal model for this,'' said Ferrari, 39.
``We have to think through every little step and talk about whether
we want to do things the straight way or something totally
different. The only thing we knew was that we wanted to do this as
soon as possible. If a state comes along and says, `We're going to
legally acknowledge you,' you don't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, when civil unions became law, town clerks have
notified the Vermont Department of Health that they have issued 19
civil union licenses, 11 of which went to out-of-state couples,
said Linda Davis, who manages the department's vital records
division. Since small towns are required to notify the state only
once a month, some here believe that perhaps three or four times
more civil unions have actually taken place. Most of those have
been to out-of-staters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks from across Vermont are saying the same thing: It may be
Vermont's law, but those taking quick advantage tend to come from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the nationwide population of gay and
lesbian people, and you think about the fact that Vermont is the
only place it's available, I can see why out-of-state people would
be the majority,'' said Dorothy Mammen, coordinator of the Vermont
Freedom to Marry Task Force, which campaigned strongly for civil
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them who are doing it quickly may well have done a
commitment ceremony at home and yet whenever they do one of those,
there's no official recognition, so they're coming here to finish
what they have started.''
</P>
<P>
   If out-of-staters are making up the majority of couples entering
into civil unions, that does not necessarily mean Vermont's gay and
lesbian couples are uninterested, many here say. Some speculate
that many of Vermont's committed lesbian and gay partners are busy
planning more involved ceremonies, deciding which caterer to hire,
which band will play, and who will be invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think the law is in any jeopardy and I
think a lot of Vermonters know that,'' said Marc Awodey, a
Burlington justice of the peace who will have performed 11 civil
unions by the end of this weekend. But the fear that the law will
someday be revoked is ``something that prompted some (out-of-state
couples) to go ahead more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if some couples hope to get hitched while the hitching's
good, others hope to use their civil unions like a seed that they
will plant in their home states. Ferrari and Lloyd, who plan to
move to Southern California in the next few weeks, say they are
quite serious about using their union as a ``test case'' in their
new state, or joining other California couples already doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Westing, the Putney justice of the peace who performed
their ceremony, said other couples have told her the same thing.
``I don't get the sense that a lot of these couples are content to
accept that their civil union is only good in a state where they
don't even live.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such high-minded arguments, some observers here believe
much of what they're seeing is plain old spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vacation time, and let's face it, this is a really
popular state for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered couples
anyway,'' said Barbara Dozetos, editor of Out in the Mountains, a
monthly newspaper that caters to the state's gay and lesbian
community. ``Don't think some couples aren't just saying, `Let's do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari, a retired cabaret dancer and sales executive, and
Lloyd, a corporate executive, say they began discussing the
ceremony months ago, when it looked as though Vermont would succeed
in legalizing such unions. When July 1 finally arrived, Ferrari
said, they decided their time had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vermont was brave enough to accept us, we had to show
support for Vermont as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the couple spent countless hours contemplating
whether to enter into civil union, their simple ceremony Thursday
seemed to pack more emotional power than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize, of course, that this means you can't get rid of
me now,'' Lloyd, 45, said moments after the men were CU'd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what this means?'' Ferrari said, laughing. ``Gee,
maybe this was a bad idea after all.''

MARTINEZ SET TO PITCH FOR MICKEY D'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making the transition from pitcher to pitchman, Red Sox Pedro
Martinez is set to appear in new McDonald's TV ads that feature
99-cent double cheeseburgers, sight gags, and a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the ads to air in two versions, one with an
English voiceover, the other with a Spanish voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the ad is to introduce a ``new everyday value''
strategy to the eastern New England market, says Bill Connell, vice
president of the Boston office of ad agency Leo Burnett. The
office's client is Mac Inc. Co-op, a marketing cooperative of
McDonald's franchisees in eastern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Past ads from Mac Inc. have often talked up a number of
different short-term promotions, such as Happy Meals and Extra
Value Meals.
</P>
<P>
   With a single, long-term focus on the 99-cent double
cheeseburger, the new marketing strategy aims to be simple and
direct, says Sid Boorstein, the president of Mac Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show we have a definable everyday value proposition
for the consumer that is clear and consistent,'' says Boorstein,
who notes that the double-cheeseburger promotion could last six
months or more.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is the first for Mac Inc. from Leo Burnett. Previous ads
were created by Arnold Communications of Boston, and over the years
Mac Inc.'s ads have used such local sports stars as Larry Bird and
Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers often see two sets of ads for McDonald's. One
originates from McDonald's headquarters in Illinois and generally
focuses on branding. Then, in regional markets, franchisees often
band together to form cooperatives such as Mac Inc. that sponsor
separate ad campaigns. In many cases, ads from the cooperatives are
highly promotional.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez ad uses McDonald's new national tagline, ``We love
to see you smile,'' which debuted last month and which replaces,
``Did somebody say McDonald's?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Connell, the local ad was carefully scripted so
Martinez wouldn't be forced to cross the picket line of the Screen
Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists, whose members are striking over pay.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox chose to honor the
strike and delay plans for taping an ad for Dunkin' Donuts, says a
spokesman for Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston, the ad
agency for the chain.
</P>
<P>
   In the new McDonald's spot starring Martinez, two young men are
attempting to watch the Red Sox game on TV, but the reception is
awful. One of the men gets up from the couch to adjust the TV's
rabbit-ears antenna. After trial and error, the antenna is twisted
into the shape of McDonald's signature Golden Arches, and suddenly
the reception is picture perfect, showing images of Martinez on the
mound, playing ball and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   All images of Martinez were stock footage taken from the
archives of Major League Baseball, Connell says; as a result,
Martinez never had to cross the actors' picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very sensitive to Pedro's position,'' Connell says.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the antenna seems to have become a popular prop in
local ads this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A recent TV ad for FleetBoston Financial has a girl trying to
tune in the ball game by using tin foil and a coat hanger to help
the antenna on her radio pull down the Red Sox signal. That ad was
created by Hill Holliday, and when the signal comes in, viewers
hear a radio announcer excitedly describing a homer just hit by
Garciaparra, who is never seen during the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Connell says he was unaware of the FleetBoston ad.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent TV ad from FleetBoston chronicles a Dominican boy
who idolizes Martinez. The only images of Martinez seen in the ad
are from newspaper clippings tacked up in the boy's room.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's franchisees presumably could use a boost that a
strong TV ad starring Martinez might give them. After many of them
invested heavily in new computerized equipment and vowed to upgrade
service, there was hope for big sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the marketplace has been intensely competitive. On the
fast-food side, rival Burger King has sought to take business away
from McDonald's with an aggressive Pokemon promotion, and with the
economy booming some consumers are opting to trade up from
fast-food fare to casual restaurants such as Chili's and the Olive
Garden, according to recently published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Boorstein remains confident that improvements at McDonald's
coupled with the new local ad campaign will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' he says of the new Martinez ad. ``And if the
Red Sox start winning, it will be even better.''

   As an idea, failure was sitting there like a hanging curve, too
sweet to ignore in this Age of Tremendousness, when life is gauged
in SUVs and stock options. Someone was bound to take a poke at it.
Jason Zasky turns out to be the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Zasky, a survivor of three defunct music magazines, was walking
in Manhattan a few years ago with his cousin, Fred Stesney, when
Stesney stopped and said: ``I have a great idea for a magazine _
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great idea,'' agreed Zasky.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins talk like that.
</P>
<P>
   Zasky ran with the concept all the way to Failure Magazine, an
online monthly publication that will surface next Monday at
Failuremag.com. As its editor and chief executive, he is convinced
he is on to something huge. Then again, so did the guy behind the
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as the geek savants tell us, branding is key on the
Internet, then Failure just might have a chance. It is quirky
enough to survive a limited run on novelty alone. After that, it's
a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Failure is exquisitely against the grain. This is
critical to a new player that must rise above the fray to survive.
Also, failure is the key ingredient of schadenfreude, our reflexive
instinct to rejoice in the misfortune of others. Schadenfreude
makes the world go around.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Zasky and his partner, Kathleen Ervin, who runs the
marketing arm, have cheek and understand the big sell. Their
T-shirts reading ``Failure _ It's An Option'' could give the
ubiquitous Black Dog logo a run for its money at Starbucks. And
their press kits are swell.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, kits from companies trolling for stories land
on reporters' desks like flying fish _ sleek, shiny things that
come out of nowhere and are summarily thrown away. The one from
Failure consists of a black mesh wastebasket in the bottom of which
lies a crumpled piece of paper that happened to be its press
release. Smart.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a clue at this point who will read Failure. Ervin,
34, claims the core audience will be men and women, ages 20 to 40,
with an emphasis on men. Zasky, 30, thinks the gender split will be
even. Either way, there will be what Ervin calls ``the car-crash
people'' _ the group of failure addicts for whom the magazine will
be a little bit of heaven on earth. ``They're the ones who just
want to see the wreck when they drive by,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin and Zasky are quick to point out that interest in failure
transcends morbid curiosity. It is has similar DNA to risk _ a
hazard of life lionized at Outward Bound and Goldman Sachs for
character-building and reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about people who want to suck the marrow out of
life,'' Erwin said about her audience. ``If you're not failing then
you're not really trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true marketeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are interested in failure because they're obsessed with
success,'' Zasky added from Failure headquarters, a three-story
house in a residential section of Scarsdale, N.Y. ``They don't want
to make the same mistakes other people have made. It's particularly
hot now with all of these Internet companies going under. Failure
is as inevitable as death and taxes. The subject always has and
always will fascinate us.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, how does he sustain a magazine on the same dark
theme? Are we really a society of car-crash people? Why won't
Failure end up as fodder for its own Web site?
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is not just a a simple black-and-white issue,'' said
Zasky, who played guitar in Black Velvet Flag, named Best Unsigned
Band in Rolling Stone's 1995 critics poll. ``If we simply recount
failures, we'd get boring and old very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean? It means that intriguing failure plays,
dumb failure doesn't. Nor will failure-on-the-road-to-success
stories that read like Fast Company magazine. Zasky must depend on
freelancers to find the right ideas and execute them well for $1 a
word. And he will need good editors.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to have most of the first three issues of Failure in
the can but will not divulge much now. One article he does trumpet
is a piece for the first issue about a bizarre old golfer who has
taken his lumps over the years. It is called ``Moe Norman: The
Greatest Golfer the World Has Never Known.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a 70-year-old former touring pro from Canada, is finally
gaining recognition late in life for his strange, deadly accurate
swing after failing on the circuit as a younger man. At one point,
he was so poor that he slept in his car. Today, he has a sponsor
and gives golf clinics. Norman blew it by conventional standards
for most of his life, writes Zasky, yet he has since succeeded in
other ways. Welcome to failure.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet story, but will anyone care? Zasky plans to run
four such pieces a month and four shorter ones each week. There
will also be an Editor's Column that may or may not run five days a
week and a daily staple called This Day In Failure documenting
disasters throughout history. Zasky packs wriggle room in his
descriptions of the product. Adverbs like ``ideally'' pop up a lot.
</P>
<P>
   He is pinning a lot on The Bomb Site, an interactive piece of
the magazine that will ask readers to rate movies before they've
seen them. It will appear every Monday and cover all films opening
later that week. The goal is 100,000 participants after the first
issue.
</P>
<P>
   How do you rate a movie sight unseen? No problema. People do it
all the time based on buzz and other ephemora. This data, it turns
out, is prized by Hollywood studios. Ervin says that some of them
have already contacted Failure about The Bomb Site and may
eventually pay for the information.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin calls Failure ``a lean-running unit.'' This means she and
Zasky are the only full-time staff _ the result of an early
decision on their part to steer clear of venture capital money. So
they are tight with the few hundred thousand dollars raised from
friends and family. Their cadre of design and technology folk,
spread from Arkansas to California, are all on contract.
</P>
<P>
   Zasky and Ervin may start in cyberspace but they hope to end up
in print. They want Failure eventually to be a real magazine. This
is a heady goal for a pair that haven't yet hit the dot-com
maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know within the first year if that will work,'' said
Ervin about their print dreams.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, there is always FailureWear, their patented line
of clothing and paraphernalia. These will be available online from
the opening bell and could well be the last thing standing if
everything else at Failure goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Zasky is betting that students will become a big slice of
Failure readership and a gold mine for its branding. That's why he
will take his Rorschach logo on a road show in September to college
campuses for a second publicity blitz.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ervin have paid close attention to this part of the
business. They went through two designers to get the right logo,
which features the word ``failure'' with the bottoms of the letters
mysteriously obscured.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Is ``Failure'' rising or falling? Your
call, says Zasky. Ervin was equally opaque: ``It's incomplete. It's
a story that has yet to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   So true. For now, Zasky and Ervin live off of panic, adrenaline,
and optimism _ just as they should at this point. The plan is in
place. It all still makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you live for,'' Ervin said. ``It feels like we're
in the part of an Andy Rooney and Judy Garland movie when they say,
`Let's put on a play on in our back yard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Failure is still a publication, not a situation.

STRONG EARNINGS, FADING FEARS BOOST TECH STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Natural Microsystems Corp. plastered the financial world with
its report on the company's second-quarter performance early
Thursday morning, well before the stock market opened for trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham, Mass. company, which makes software and hardware
components for communications equipment suppliers, reported profits
more than twice as high as analysts had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Microsystems stock took off like a rocket as soon as the
market opened and climbed even higher through the day, eventually
soaring $25.5625 to close at $129.50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of booming reaction has been taking place among a
handful of select technology stocks reporting quarterly profits
over the past few days, beginning with Yahoo Inc. early in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   As worries over climbing interest rates slowly recede, much
stronger than expected corporate earnings are proving to be a
powerful stock market catalyst, especially among technology stocks
still trading far below their highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew things were going well in tech land, but some of the
numbers have just been spectacular,'' said Marc Klee, portfolio
manager of the John Hancock Technology fund. ``Rarely do you find
companies doing that in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If a bellwether company in a particular industry
blew past business expectations for the second quarter, chances are
others in the same line of work did well, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba Inc., which sells products to help companies do business
with each other over the Internet, reported quarterly sales that
outstripped forecasts by more than 50 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ariba stock boomed, gaining $27.6875 to $131.1875, on the news.
</P>
<P>
   But Commerce One Inc., another high-profile business-to-business
Internet company, also gained nearly 16 percent in value Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pent-up enthusiasm, though still narrowly channeled to stocks in
specific industries, follows a period of interest rate fears and,
more recently, the ``pre-announcement'' season when companies
typically try to soften the blow of disappointing quarterly results
with early warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: We have just entered a corporate reporting period
that will stretch through next week and may well be a catalyst for
further technology stock advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the early indications are that we're going to have a
couple of strong weeks for technology stocks,'' said Dale Dutile,
comanager of the MFS Emerging Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: A certain amount of investor sobriety regarding
technology stock valuations, acquired painfully in the spring,
appears to be in danger of going out of style again.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Microsystem's second-quarter operating profit of about
$4.2 million was terrific by all accounts. But the news added more
than $400 million to the company's stock market value, which
ballooned to $2.1 billion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the current rally note that many of the stocks
benefitting the most at the moment were those damaged worst in the
spring. And those soaring by as much as 20 percent in a single day
are doing it with reports that prove their business is stronger
than anyone believed.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Few people expect much more bad news about
interest rates from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculative fires were never extinguished; they were just
dampened,'' said analyst Philip Fine, who follows small techology
stocks for Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really looking past August, and once we get through
maybe a (quarter percentage point) hike in August, I think the
Street would be astonished if Greenspan raised rates on the eve of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader technology stock indexes have moved ahead sharply this
week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, up 118 points to 4174.86 in the
last two days, was in the black for the year on Wednesday for the
first time since April 10.
</P>
<P>
   But Dutile and others note that not all technology stocks are
enjoying better times. Some companies focused on electronic
commerce, Internet infrastructure, telecommunications, and
semiconductors are moving up. Other companies, including mainframe
computer companies and service businesses focused on older, legacy
computer systems, aren't reaping any stock market rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Among those stocks that have suddenly regained their popularity,
the question of valuation remains. How much is enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you tech stocks are cheap, but I think
they're OK,'' Klee said. ``The successful ones are better
(businesses) today than when they peaked, but they're more
reasonably priced, too.''

SUV OWNERS SHOULD THINK OF NIGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is an aspect of the ``global economy'' that no one wants to
talk about:
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria accounts for one-twelfth of American oil imports. As we
zoom down the highway and clog urban streets with sports utility
vehicles, villagers in Adeje, Nigeria, are this week lifting the
charred remains of 250 victims, including many children in school
uniforms, away from the site of a petroleum pipeline explosion.
</P>
<P>
   As sales of SUVs stay strong, the villagers see no end in sight
for these kinds of deaths. People in southern Nigeria, who live
among 3,100 miles of pipelines, are often so poor that it is a fact
of life that vandals puncture holes in the pipelines and residents
fill buckets with oil to sell in an underground economy.
Inevitably, whether through a careless cigarette or careful malice,
someone drops a light on the spilled oil.
</P>
<P>
   Small fires are so common that local officials no longer make
any attempt to put them out. The large fires defy any attempt to
put them out. Two years ago, an explosion in the nearby town of
Jesse killed about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is driven by poverty and greed,'' said Doyin Okupe,
spokesman for Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, told Reuters.
``They know the risks. It is very difficult for us to (convince
people to stop) when people already know the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we thought as globally as we do locally, we might
consider how we help the process along, driven by wealth and greed.
We have found it difficult to stop producing our gas guzzlers, with
a White House that put stunningly little pressure on the greedy
petroleum companies to put pressure on the greedy, antidemocratic
forces that ruled Nigeria in the 1990s. We find it difficult, even
though we already know the risks that begin with pollution in the
production fields and end in ozone-depleting exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Scott, Ford's SUV marketing director, recently boasted,
``We had record SUV sales in May, and sales in June were rockin'
and rollin'.'' In Adeje, friends and relatives of the dead were
rushing in to sneak bodies away from the disaster to avoid the
police. ``This really wasn't a surprise,'' villager Austin Obaseki
told the Associated Press. ``Our people know the danger of scooping
for petrol. But they have to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month a Chevrolet sales manager bragged to the Columbus
Dispatch, ``Tahoes, Suburbans, all of them. We're selling them
right and left.'' Even without the puncturing of pipelines by
vandals, life is grim enough in southern Nigeria, with many reports
of farmland and fishing grounds being devastated by negligent leaks
by the petroleum companies. Life here has become a slow-motion
Bhopal, with the total death toll from all the pipeline explosions
of recent years now over half of the 2,000 of the town devastated
by the gas leak by Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation, doubled with the corruption of the Nigerian
government (if you thought the US wimped out on connecting human
rights and trade in China, you missed Nigeria's execution of human
rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa), has left these villagers with few
options except puncturing the pipelines. Ndu Ugahamadu, the
spokesman for the state-run Nigeria Petroleum company, said ``The
villagers thought it was manna from heaven and were fetching
petroleum products like water.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as our SUVs drink gasoline like water. When people scrounge
this desperately for petroleum, we Americans seem insufferable in
prizing our Expeditions, Navigators, Land Cruisers, LX470s, Grand
Cherokees, Tahoes, Yukons, QX4s , Blazers, Silverados, and Land
Rovers, all of which get between 13 and 16 miles per gallon,
overall.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, riding an SUV is less about utilizing a
vehicle for sports (not with our exploding epidemic of obesity)
than about feeling as if you are riding on top of the world. I
confess that I, too, have been tempted by SUVs, test driving a few
to replace our aging minivan. I understand the allure of wide open
spaces, with two growing boys, a dog and, yes, sports equipment. A
close relative of mine in Texas, who has an Expedition, said in
true Lone Star fashion, ``If I'm in an accident, I'd rather take
someone out than get taken out.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be time to consider that in our own scooping for
petrol, we are taking somebody out. As we ride high and proud, 9,
10 and 12 inches off the ground, our tires may be rolling over an
unseen pedestrian. The deaths in Adeje this week, Jesse two years
ago, and all the smaller disasters in between offer a chance to
consider how we get that tiger in our tank.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Schwab, president of Porsche North America, last month told
CBS News, ``This SUV market is for real. It's here. It's here to
stay.'' The market might be roaring. Our V-6s and V-8s might be
snarling. As long as it does, there will be some villagers in
Nigeria, taking their buckets to the pipeline. It is there that the
tiger in the tank has a fatal bite.

`AMERICAN PIMP' A SKIN-DEEP LOOK AT SEX TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN PIMP 
Documentary by: Allen and Albert Hughes 
Running time: 87 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last year we have seen, in descending order, ``American
Beauty,'' ``American Pie,'' ``American Movie,'' ``American
Psycho,'' and now, perhaps inevitably, ``American Pimp.'' The
latter doesn't make it to the big screen often, at least not in
documentary fashion. Several do here, but Allen and Albert Hughes
seem far more charmed than critical, which means their film amounts
to a mostly wasted opportunity. If not exactly a whitewash,
``American Pimp'' lets its subjects off easy, consisting of a few
softball questions and a lot of jive-talking, often charismatic,
usually evasive, although if you listen long enough the unvarnished
exploitativeness of the sex trade emerges clearly enough. As one
pimp puts it when asked how a woman could consent to such a
one-sided arrangement, he replies that his job is to ``steal a
bitch's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That perhaps explains why a woman would place herself in such a
victimized state, especially since an experienced pimp is a shrewd
street psychologist, able to zero in on women susceptible to his
line. There's no violence, no drugs in the clips we see, never so
much as a bad hair day. Mostly just a string of fast-talking guys
grabbing face time to fill the screen with their self-justifying.
As one Versace-draped pimp named K-Red from Washington, D.C., puts
it: ``My mouth is an Uzi, and I'm armed and dangerous with a double
clip.'' It's more than glibness. Skilled pimps specialize in
telling prostitutes (and women the pimps want to recruit as
prostitutes) what they want and perhaps need to hear. Never do we
see drugs. Seldom do we see the other end of the equation _ the
mostly white guys who pay to not be seriously inconvenienced by the
mostly black pimps or their compliant subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Given that glibness is their stock in trade, it's not surprising
that the pimps we see, with names like Fillmore Slim, Rosebudd with
two d's, and Bishop Magic Don Juan, are fast-talking charmers,
convivial, almost relieved to pick up on the Hughes brothers' lead
that they be regarded as just another variety of businessman, no
different than, say, a vendor of plumbing supplies. The prostitutes
aren't given nearly as much screen time. Of those who are, a few
seem stoned, or just plain dumb, content to live with the line that
the pimps have imprinted on them, the idea being that they support
the pimp lavishly, keeping little or no money for themselves and
are lucky to share him with several other women, harem-style. When
they aren't working, that is. Never do they wonder why they seem to
have such short shelf lives while the pimps seem to have such long
ones as ``American Pimp'' punctuates the interviews with clips from
exploitation films such as ``The Mack,'' from which most of the
pimps derived their self-image.
</P>
<P>
   A few have left the game, one, ironically, having exchanged
pimping for telemarketing. Another turns out to be a big momma's
boy, basking in his mother's approval since he found Jesus. The
Hughes brothers escape innocuousness by strongly implying that
black pimps are tolerated, and even allowed to live flamboyantly on
the fringe, because they provide a clandestine service to white men
with money. In Nevada, where prostitution is legal, a white man
owns the biggest brothel and he's no less glib. The highly
image-conscious black pimps are on their best behavior for the
camera. It's the white entrepreneur who provides the film's most
offensive moment when he asks one of his employees to pose facing
away from the camera on her knees, then pats her rump
proprietorially as she complies. That single gesture crystallizes
the commodification of women that should be the film's real
subject, but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   By playing to the pimps' ego thirst, the Hughes brothers may
have assumed they would get them to open up. ``American Pimp''
includes, without irony, footage of a pimps' convention in which
the pimps celebrate themselves, presumably because nobody else
will. Nobody until the Hughes brothers, that is. Probably there
wouldn't have been a film if the brothers had subjected their
subjects to anything like hard interrogation. Instead, the pimps
take over, and turn ``American Pimp'' from documentary into
performance art. The film creates the impression that the Hughes
brothers were willingly seduced, or at least fast-talked by the
pimps, who surely can't always have been as unfailingly
entertaining and jovial as they are here. ``American Pimp,'' if not
quite a self-serving orgy of self-justification, can hardly be
thought of as a searching look at the skin trade.

`BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER' LACKS SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER 
Directed by: Jamie Babbit 
Screenplay by Brian Wayne Peterson 
Starring: Natasha Lyonne, Clea DuVall, RuPaul Charles, Cathy
Moriarty, Bud Cort, Mink Stole, Eddie Cibrian, Melanie Lynskey,
Katharine Towne 
Running time: 85 minutes 
Rated: R (strong language and sexual content involving teens) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natasha Lyonne has it in her to be one of film's great young
skeptics. She wears a perpetually inquiring look on her face and
her throaty little Julie Kavner voice has a question mark built
into the end of every assertion. She wants answers. Not that she's
destined to get any from her new film, ``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
It shortchanges her on every count. It's a lame and painfully
overextended satire of homophobia. In it, Lyonne's cheerleader,
Megan, is sent to a sort of heterosexual boot camp for heavy duty
deprogramming after her parents, her cheerleading girlfriends, and
her boyfriend freak out over Megan's lesbian tendencies. Megan
doesn't seem to have noticed that she stares at girls, tapes girls'
swimsuit pinups inside her locker, and reflexively wipes her
boyfriend's kisses off with the back of her hand before they've had
a chance to dry.
</P>
<P>
   In the campy, cartoony world of the film, which cries out for
the touch of a John Waters, and in fact has one of his longtime
regulars, Mink Stole, in the role of Megan's horrified mother,
Megan is bundled off to a color-coded place called True Directions,
run by Cathy Moriarty as a sort of gauleiter of heterosexuality.
She already has emasculated her adolescent son named Rock (this is
the film's level of humor) and means to steamroll the campers, most
of whom cannot be described as happy. The boys wear blue, while the
girls are engulfed by pink. They not only wear pink, they sleep in
it. Their cabin contains pink padded headboards, pink quilts, pink
walls. Sleeping inside it is like sleeping inside a huge intestine.
</P>
<P>
   If Megan was undecided about her sexuality when she arrived, she
quickly enough edges into a relationship with Cleo DuVall's
smolderingly miserable but appealingly intense Graham. Their love
scene, when they do have it, seems to have been spliced in from
some other movie. Camp takes a holiday and their coupling is
realistic and tender. Otherwise, the film is so galumphingly
executed that its sweet plea for sexual openmindedness collapses
under a pileup of clunkiness so maladroit as to verge on the
amateurish before veering into a cement-handed ending out of ``The
Graduate.'' ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' leaves Lyonne, DuVall, and a
sympathetic RuPaul Charles, as a counselor who says he's an ex-gay
but shows little evidence of it, in the coveted
nowhere-to-go-but-up mode.

GREEN DAY EMBRACES WARPED EQUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Punk-rock heroes Green Day are bashing back into view on this
year's Vans Warped Tour. The band won't release a new album until
October, but didn't want to wait that long to tour again. Given
Green Day's populist ethic, the Vans Warped Tour has been the ideal
place for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to stretch our necks out and get back in the
ring,'' says Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt. ``And we wanted to play
with all of these punk bands. Some people have called us the
headliners of the tour, but I think there are 38 headliners, if
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the number of bands on the multistage Vans Warped Tour,
traveling with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Papa Roach (whose
singer, Coby Dick, calls the tour a ``punk rock summer camp''),
Long Beach Dub Allstars, MxPx, Suicide Machines, and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never done it before, but it's such a great tour,''
says Dirnt. ``It has proven itself year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Day even enjoys the daily coin toss that determines the
order of the bands, rather than giving the bigger-named acts the
first choice. Green Day has gone on everywhere from early afternoon
to the evening, though ``we're usually somewhere in between,'' says
Dirnt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sense of equality on this tour,'' he adds. ``I
mean, great bands go on before us, and great bands go on after us.
It's a celebration of punk rock through the '90s into the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   It also comes complete with demonstrations of motorcycle
jumping, skateboarding, rock climbing, and a ``human cannonball''
named David Smith Jr., who gets shot out of a cannon every day.
``He's the real headliner,'' Dirnt says, laughing. ``Rumor has it
he comes out 2 inches shorter every time he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-for-all spirit of punk is also illustrated by how some
of the bands chipped in when the drummer of NoFx got hurt in a
bicycling accident earlier in the tour. Green Day drummer Tre Cool
sat in as a replacement. And so did drummers from several other
acts, including the Suicide Machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about punk rock. People will help each
other out,'' says Dirnt.
</P>
<P>
   Each act plays for only 30 minutes, but that doesn't bother
Dirnt, either. ``It's awesome, really, because you get the best of
what everybody has to offer in a combined package, and everyone's
got a short attention span nowadays, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Day could have toured last year as opening act for the
Rolling Stones, but declined because it was working on its upcoming
album, ``Warning.'' Says Dirnt: ``I like the Stones. I love the
Stones. They are an amazing band, but do they listen to our
records? Probably not. But I'm not worried about it. Making our new
record was really important, and we didn't want to take a break
from where we were creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Warning,'' Dirnt is reluctant to comment before the
release (and the band is not performing songs from it this tour),
but says the title track is about questioning authority (``A lot of
rules were meant to be broken, and a lot of laws were meant to be
disobeyed,'' he says), while noting that the sound of the record
has evolved somewhat. There are more acoustic guitars played by
Green Day's Billie Armstrong, but ``he's playing them like Pete
Townshend would play them. He's playing them like electric guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we feel stupid trying to sit here and describe the record
and sell it. It's like, `Look, it's a good record. If you don't
like it, if you're skeptical, then borrow the tape from somebody
first. We're happy with it. It's a Green Day record. It's bound to
have good songs on it. More than one, at least. You'll have a hell
of a time downloading all these good songs.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Def Leppard returns: Is it cool again to like Def Leppard? The
Brit pop-metal band was huge in the '80s, selling 10 million copies
of ``Pyromania'' (1983) and 12 million of ``Hysteria'' (1987). Then
the bottom fell out in the '90s, when the grunge movement shoved
the more polished Leppard aside. ``It became a case of `If you like
this, then you couldn't like that,' '' recalls Leppard guitarist
Phil Collen. ``But things are changing. We've been handed loads of
compliments by many artists who you think would have hated us, like
Everclear, Hole, and Orgy. We did the `Edge Fest' in Minneapolis
last summer with Hole, and (singer) Courtney Love said some great
things about us from the stage.'' In addition, the Offspring
sampled the spoken intro to Def Leppard's ``Rock of Ages'' and put
it on the beginning of their hit, ``Pretty Fly (For a White Guy).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a theory,'' says Collen. ``If you're popular one
decade, then you're not going to be popular the next decade, but
the decade after that, you're cool again. When the '80s came,
suddenly everything in the '60s was cool and retro. In the '90s,
the '70s were cool. And now in the year 2000, the '80s are all
right again.''
</P>
<P>
   Def Leppard floundered with its stripped-down ``Slang'' album in
1996, but rebounded last year with ``Euphoria,'' which evoked the
more classic '80s Leppard sound and reunited the band with producer
Mutt Lange (now Shania Twain's husband/producer), who also co-wrote
three songs. The album has gone gold (500,000 sold).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have songs that you can sing with conviction, then you
should keep going,'' says Collen. ``And we still feel that way.''

SHE IS SHELBY LYNNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Shelby Lynne is ornery. You can see it from
across the hotel lobby. Bad attitude grips her like the leather
that covers every inch of her elfin body. Suspicion, sharp as her
boot tips, looms behind jet-black glasses that are never removed.
Lynne is not a fan of question-posers, career-chroniclers, or
smiling people with notebooks and pens. They have done her wrong _
big-time, as far as she's concerned. She's shaking hands, speaking
politely (for the most part), only because Lynne has this shiny
round disc that pretty much sums up everything she feels,
everything she believes is true, everything she hoped she would
become, and she very much wants people to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Lynne says about her new CD, ``is the real stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Her accent is thick with the off-road twang of rural Alabama,
where she grew up. She doesn't mince words. ``This is what I'm
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Am Shelby Lynne,'' released in January, is no less a
proclamation of self-discovery, of hard-won independence, than the
title suggests. At 31, after recording five albums of other
people's songs for three different record labels in Nashville,
Lynne has made the record she was never quite sure she had in her.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fetching, occasionally radiant juxtaposition of blue-eyed
soul, honky-tonk, slick rock, and torn-up torch produced by Bill
Botrell, who also works with Sheryl Crow. Despite critical raves,
``I Am Shelby Lynne'' has hardly made a dent on the charts. Lynne,
who opens for k.d. lang Aug. 31 at FleetBoston Pavilion, is nothing
if not a realist, and she's duly mystified by the vagaries of
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to make that work,'' she says in an interview
at the South by Southwest Music Conference here in March. ``I think
about it all the time: how to do what I want to do. All I can do is
try to make some videos, play live, which is what I love. I think
the music has to find its way.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. Lynne grew up in the tiny town of Franklin
in a musical family: Her father played guitar; mama, she says, sang
like a bird; and Shelby listened to records. ``Elvis, Bob Dylan,
country music. I never really did anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a series of traumatic events: Her father shot and
killed her mother and then himself during an argument in 1986,
leaving then 16-year-old Lynne to raise her younger sister. Lynne
married and divorced soon after. At 18, she hit Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne was singled out almost immediately as an emerging country
star; her first performance on TNN's ``Nashville Now'' sparked a
major label bidding war, and George Jones asked her to record a
duet with him. Over the next five years Lynne recorded as many
albums, earning the respect, if not always the affection, of her
Nashville colleagues _ and the sort of reputation that often comes
to women who think for themselves on notoriously patriarchal Music
Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I got the difficult label,'' Lynne announces. ``And
that's fine with me. I know I'm not difficult. I don't have any
difficulty in showing my opinion and I don't agree with everything.
If it's not all right with me, it's not doing anybody any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were compounded by Lynn's occasional brushes with
authorities _ one involving cocktails and loud singing onan
airplane, from which she was unceremoniously escorted, and another
having to do with driving someone else's car over county lines in
Texas. ``You know, I drink, smoke, have a terrible attitude
sometimes. I can't help it,'' Lynne says. ``But it's blown out of
proportion. It's not like any of it is a lie, it's just things look
like (expletive) in print. You give up a lot when you do press, and
you have to know that going in. And I do. What the hell am I going
to do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lynne just picked up and left Nashville, and returned
to Alabama. That was 1995. A romantic might call what came next
Lynne's lost years. From the outside it looked like a protracted
period of so-called downtime. Way down, by all accounts. Except
that Lynne started writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't all down,'' she says. ``That's another thing that
was fabricated. I just didn't know what was gonna happen. And when
you're a worrisome little wiry weirdo, you worry about things that
aren't right up in your face so you can see it happening. But songs
just started coming out. I was finally convinced that I could do
it, although at the time I didn't know if I'd be doing it in a
hotel lobby or on a record. But it didn't matter. I finally figured
out what I wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the songs on ``I Am Shelby Lynn'' are about
love, and losing love, and just plain losing. They're
ripped-from-the-heart sad, and deeply bitter. It's raw, despite
Botrell's super-polished production, because Lynne sings songs like
``Your Lies'' and ``Life is Bad'' with the beautiful ache of
someone who's come out the other side and is still standing. It
doesn't seem a stretch to call this collection cathartic. But it's
a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's a bunch of (expletive),'' Lynne says. She may have
found peace of mind in Palm Springs, Calif., her new hometown, but
it hasn't exactly dulled her edge. ``Why does everything have to be
some realization? I know it's good. It's not therapy for me; it's
what I do. It's hard, I love it, I was born to do it. I'd kill
somebody to do it.''

KENNEDY DOCUMENTARY CURSED BY CYNICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
KENNEDYS: THE CURSE OF POWER 
Produced by: Patrick Bachmann and Linda Midgett 
Date: Saturday at 9 p.m. 
On: The History Channel 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are the Kennedys cursed?'' asks the narrator of a new History
Channel presentation rooting through the lives of the fabled
political family from its arrival in the United States in 1849
until the present. The question sounds like a headline ripped from
the front page of a supermarket tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that the two-hour ``Kennedys: The Curse of
Power'' is just more trashy exploitation of America's royal family?
How could it be, stocked as the production is with sympathetic
talking heads, largely family and friends, sympathetic journalists,
and political cronies?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``The Curse of Power,'' airing Saturday night at 9,
is little more than a litany of tragic deaths, accidents, psychic
wounds, diseases, and broken biblical commandments. It rehearses
all of the violent and premature deaths, from the storied
assassinations to the mid-air explosion of Joseph, Jr.'s Navy plane
in 1944 to Michael Kennedy's fatal skiing accident and his brother
David's deadly drug overdose to the flight that a year ago took the
lives of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether this documentary would even have been made
if not for JFK Jr.'s sudden death and the opportunity it affords
for an anniversary review of Kennedy misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the production, which is scripted and edited
with transparent cynicism. For one example, consider the peculiarly
short segment on John F. Kennedy and his presidency. There is next
to nothing about his policies or politics, and the only positive
note, praising his comfort level with the Washington press corps,
is struck to make a negative point, that he was a shrewd accomplice
in manufacturing his own image. Otherwise, we hear only that, like
his notorious dad, he was a reckless womanizer, and that he died
violently in Dallas. So much for the 35th president.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Robert gets slightly fairer and longer treatment before
he's pictured dying in a pool of his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any list of Kennedy calamities, self-inflicted and
otherwise, must include Edward Kennedy's plunge off of the
Chappaquiddick bridge and the ensuing death of Mary Jo Kopechne.
But is the loss of son Edward Jr.'s leg to bone cancer relevant in
the scheme of things? Apparently, yes. ``The Curse of Power'' also
implies that the 1973 air accident that took the life of Aristotle
Onassis's son Alexander was curse-by-association. At the time,
Aristotle was married to Jacqueline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely possible that the on-camera commentators _ among
them Ted Sorensen, Ben Bradlee, and the Boston Globe's Tom Oliphant
_ provided context and analysis when they were interviewed. But
thanks to manipulative, tendentious editing, what we have here,
dressed up as a serious historical documentary, is too-familiar
sleaze.

DIXIE CHICKS HAVE SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country women have been on a roll. Think of Shania Twain. Think
of Faith Hill. And, most of all this summer, think of the Dixie
Chicks, who are on their first arena-level headlining tour. They
are selling out nationally with their special blend of energetic
country and irrepressible shtick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be a female right now,'' says Emily Robison
of the Chicks. ``It's a good time for women in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks are not only empowering other women to follow suit,
but are doing what few country acts have been able to do in recent
years. They are capturing young fans who might otherwise be at
shows by teen-pop acts such as Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based drummer Billy Beard, who is with opening act Patty
Griffin's band, says that touring with the Dixie Chicks this summer
is ``like opening for the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some young fans with high-pitched screams,''
Robison admits gleefully. ``I've been surprised by how frenzied the
crowd has been. But we don't have a dance troupe. That separates us
from all the rest of those (teen-pop) acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is the Chicks' musical ability. Robison is
accomplished on many stringed instruments from banjo to dobro. Her
sister Chick (and blood sister, too), Martie Seidel, is a virtuoso
fiddler. Singer Natalie Maines has enough chutzpah and talent (she
went to Berklee College of Music) to put the whole thing over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks have been a phenomenon, selling 9 million copies of
their ``Wide Open Spaces'' album, which put them on the map a few
years ago; and 5 million of their latest, ``Fly,'' which cemented
the bond with their fanatical crowd and showed the Chicks are more
than just a country act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've transcended country radio,'' says Robison. ``Even though
country stations are the only stations we've been played on, we
also get a lot of word-of-mouth popularity. That's how a lot of the
young girls and young boys hear about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's uncharted territory for country,'' Robison says
of the Chicks' status. ``Country is always changing and, for
whatever reason, people decided they wanted something different.
And we are different.''
</P>
<P>
   They're different in that not only do they add an old-timey,
banjo/dobro/high-stepping flavor to some of their songs, but they
also perform tunes by Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crow. Their latest
album departs from the Chicks' upbeat, honky-tonk streak to even
include a song about spousal abuse, ``Goodbye Earl,'' which has
earned approval from the National Coalition Against Domestic
Violence. ``Women have thanked us for bringing the subject up
again,'' says Robison.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Chicks have more freedom to do what they want
because of their massive commercial success. They admit, for
instance, that ``Goodbye Earl'' might not have landed on their
previous album because the record company might have rejected it.
The same with the more provocative ``Sin Wagon,'' which has a line
about ``mattress dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we probably wouldn't have gotten that on there,
either,'' says Robison. ``But `mattress dancing' is like Mr. Rogers
compared to some of the stuff that gets on the radio today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks are likewise using their newfound freedom and clout
to stage one of the more ambitious arena spectacles of the summer.
They hired Cirque du Soleil set designer Luc LaFortune, who worked
on Cirque's acclaimed ``O'' show in Las Vegas, to punch up the
lighting and other visuals, which include clips from CMT, only in
this case it's ``Chicks Music Television,'' not the Country Music
Television cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Chicks' good-time image, they also have a
stage curtain shaped like a pair of trousers, with a zipper that
opens in the middle. It's a play on the album title, ``Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite parts of the show. It's so wrong and
so right at the same time,'' Robison says of the trouser motif.
``But we're not above some gags.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they above suggesting every meaning of the word ``Fly.''
They have a fly-shaped helium balloon (shades of Pink Floyd's pig)
that is hoisted above the crowd before the show and drops vouchers
for merchandise. ``We like to think of it as an incentive for
people to get there early,'' Robison says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up as concertgoers of all sorts of music, we had
high expectations of ourselves for this tour. I wanted it to be as
cool as seeing Bon Jovi when I was in the seventh grade. We're a
band, and we're mainly going to be playing music, but there's also
an art to putting together an arena show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks have also kept their ticket prices reasonable, with a
top in the $40 range (a bargain by arena standards).
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you'll want to see another Dixie Chicks show, so we
want you to be able to afford it,'' Robison says. ``We're laying
the groundwork for what we hope will be future tours for a long
time.''

WOLFF ILLUMINATES BACH'S WORLD WITH AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH 
The Learned Musician 
By Christoph Wolff 
Harvard University Press, 599 pp., illustrated, $39.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What there is to know about Bach, Christoph Wolff knows. (In
fact, even now, 250 years after the composer's death, Wolff has
added detail to the sum of knowledge on the subject.) And
everything Wolff knows about Bach's life, he has poured into this
new and magisterial biographical portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff also knows how much he doesn't know, and what no one can
know, and indicating dimensions of unavoidable ignorance is an
additional virtue of his book.
</P>
<P>
   Bach was a learned musician; within days of his death his
achievement in music was being compared to Sir Isaac Newton's
achievement in science. Wolff is learned, too; he teaches at
Harvard and serves as dean of the graduate school of arts and
sciences. Because of its subject, his book is necessarily learned,
but it is also user-friendly, helpful, and entertainingly
informative. Listeners in Boston who heard WHRB-FM's magnificent
Bach Orgy last winter will recall how direct and illuminating was
Wolff's commentary on Bach's major works, and on the major musical
issues that Bach confronted. The same manner is evident in his book
_ Wolff wants to share his awe and his enthusiasm, and to awaken
those qualities in the reader.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff uses technical language when he has to, but always
explains what he means; pages of musical examples are relegated to
an appendix, where they will prove helpful to the musical reader
but not intimidating to others. Much information is gathered into
tables where it can be studied at a glance. There are many
illustrations, and computer enhancement has altered many drawings
to make venues appear as they did in Bach's time.
</P>
<P>
   The knowable facts about Bach's life would fit onto a few pages,
and, indeed, Wolff provides a handy 10-page chronology in an
appendix. When Wolff must be speculative, which is often, he is
honestly so, and presents several alternative explanations of
things we do know.
</P>
<P>
   His main text surrounds the facts of Bach's life with an
invaluable sense of context _ additional facts about musical life,
courts, patronage, church doctrine, ecclesiastical and municipal
politics. The biography is also a portrait of what can be known
about Bach's world, and a summary of the practical obstacles and
opportunities he faced. There are also a few glimpses of domestic
life; of Bach's love of wine, food, and tobacco; of his second
wife's fondness for songbirds and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bach's character, not a whole lot more is known, though he
was obviously industrious and knew how to concentrate. Wolff makes
much of how comprehensive Bach's plan always was. From our point of
view, he displayed complete mastery of every dimension of musical
composition that existed in his time _ harmony, counterpoint, form,
and style _ and he created some of those dimensions; his work is
our definition of what mastery is. From another point of view,
Bach's work represents a lifelong process of self-education and of
artistic development _ an attempt, in Wolff's words, to bring
``into congruence original thought, technical exactitude and
aesthetic beauty.'' Bach wrote his music not to demonstrate his
mastery but to achieve it. And of course, for him, writing music
was a spiritual act, a function of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
   Vast as his surviving output is, much of the music that Bach is
known to have written has vanished, including two whole cycles of
cantatas, more than 100 of them. And composition was only one
aspect of Bach's all-encompassing life in music _ he was a teacher,
a conductor, a keyboard virtuoso, a scholar, an expert in the
design and technology of musical instruments, a publisher, an
entrepreneur; music was the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Bach was evidently of genial disposition, but could turn
obstreperous when he felt ``threatened in his art.'' There are a
few lively anecdotes. Once he noisily chased a meddlesome church
official out of the choir loft. Another time an ill-timed display
of temper against a duke or high official cost him a month in jail.
Characteristically, Bach turned the time to good account. An early
commentator, who was perhaps in a position to know, said that Bach
wrote the preludes and fugues of Book I of the ``Well-Tempered
Clavier'' ``in a place where ennui, boredom, and the absence of any
kind of musical instrument forced him to resort to this pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff supplies an epilogue about ``Bach and the Idea of `Musical
Perfection,' '' but closes his biography with the famous anecdote
about Mozart's visit to Leipzig in 1789, where he heard a motet by
Bach, a composer then more known in hearsay than in performance.
Mozart is said to have exclaimed, ``Now there is something one can
learn from!''
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, like every composer who followed Bach, learned from him.
Wolff has provided every lover of Bach with a book to learn from.

SCREEN WEEP HOLES TO KEEP WASPS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   16, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Q. My brick siding has small holes along every few courses of
brick. What purpose do they serve? Insects are getting into the
holes and may be making nests. How can I keep them out without
plugging the holes?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE PINHERO, Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, those are weep holes in the brick, allowing water that
gets behind the brick to flow out or evaporate. You can fill those
weep holes with a bit of screening without compromising their
drainage function. Roll screening into a tube and stuff it in. If
there are insects (probably wasps) there now, you can hit them with
a hornet and wasp bomb before putting in the screening. To hit
them, wait until the cool of the evening when they are less active.
Then hit them with the spray and run indoors. Repeat as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid all this spraying by letting the wasps stay until
fall and winter, when the cold will kill them. They are beneficial
(they pollinate plants and eat other bugs).
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks for the idea of spraying perfume in your newspaper
delivery box to keep birds out. Great idea, and it goes straight
into the handyman's file of great advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a 1932 brick Colonial (the bottom half is brick) with
paint washing from the second-floor, 15-year-old white aluminum
siding, down the face of the brickwork, staining it. How do I wash
away this stain? I am worried that power-washing may loosen the
mortar, and am curious if these now white bricks can be restored to
the original color.
</P>
<P>
   JOE COUGHLIN, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The white stain is from rain washing off the powdering paint
on the aluminum siding. The older the siding gets, the more the
paint will powder. To prevent that, remove the siding and put up
wood siding and stain it. Or, paint the siding: Sand it to roughen
the finish, wash with a strong detergent and water, and apply two
thin coats of a latex solid stain or two thin coats of a latex
house paint.
</P>
<P>
   To clean the brick, power-wash it. The spray should not harm the
mortar if it is intact. If it starts to deteriorate, stop and scrub
the stain with a strong detergent solution.
</P>
<P>
   Finish with Drylock, or other masonry sealer; this will make it
easier to wash off any future stains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever heard of vinyl shingles, instead of the
standard vinyl siding (horizontal clapboards)? Are they any good,
or better than the siding?
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN McMAHON, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, we have heard of them, and have seen them at home shows.
They are different from the standard siding, but they are still
vinyl and hollow, as are the clapboards, and in my opinion, not
worth putting on your house. If you can't opt for wood, consider
fiber-cement siding that comes in clapboards and shingles. While it
is an artificial siding, I think fiber-cement is the best of the
non-wood siding. It is made by James Hardie, Inc., of California.

   When a caller recently asked how to keep his dogs in his yard
and to keep other dogs out of the yard, without a cumbersome,
expensive fence, the handyman suggested an invisible fence, an
electric system that zaps the dogs gently when they try to get out.
Once zapped, the dogs get the message and stay away from the
invisible fence.
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, said William Carpenter of Marshfield, Mass.,
who said the invisible fence only keeps the owner's dogs in the
yard, because they must wear a collar to make the fence work.
Outside dogs, other animals, and kids, too, can go into and out of
the yard with impunity, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the correction, William Carpenter. So it's back to
the drawing board, and the handyman suggests a fence high enough to
keep from jumping over. It could be a picket fence topped by
lattice, which is quite open and airy, and not intimidating. Such
fences are good neighbors' fences, as well, combining privacy and
good looks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our inside walls have dark paneling. One of our cats used a
wall as a litter box, staining the paneling with urine and in some
places turning it white. Is there a stain or finish that can reduce
or eliminate the stain?
</P>
<P>
   J.E.B, Belleview, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your best bet is to sand that stain to the bare wood, then
apply a penetrating oil stain to match the paneling. Minwax makes a
good stain for this purpose. If the patch job is dull and does not
match the gloss on the rest of the paneling, you might be able to
touch it up with satin polyurethane varnish. If the contrast is not
too great, don't bother with the varnish, especially if it is near
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   If the paneling is photographic hardboard (a layer of wood-look
vinyl over hardboard), you may have to touch it up with Polyshade
of the right color, another Minwax product that is essentially a
varnish stain.

SPANIARD WINS BASTILLE DAY STAGE OF TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRAGUIGNAN, France _ Francois Simon awoke Friday morning with a
song in his heart. So did Christophe Agnolutto, Didier Rous,
Stephane Heulot and nearly 30 other French riders in the Tour de
France. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That song was ``La Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem.
Friday was Bastille Day, the French national holiday. So victory by
a French rider of a stage on this day was special.
</P>
<P>
   But what was mostly remembered by the vast Tour entourage were
past indignities on the sacred day committed by foreigners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outrage was generally expressed thus: Remember the time a few
years back when Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, an Uzbek, won a Bastille
Day stage? Remember last year, when Giuseppe Guerini, an Italian,
finished first? What next, many asked _ a Belgian? A Croatian? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, a Spaniard: Vicente Garcia-Acosta, 27, a humble worker for
his homeland's Banesto team. In his fifth year as a professional,
with two previous victories to his credit and a world ranking of
No. 309, Garcia-Acosta split from two traveling companions with 11
kilometers (7 miles) to go and rolled to victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Acosta was timed in 4 hours, 3 minutes and 2 seconds, a
rapid 45 kilometers an hour, for the 185.5-kilometer 13th stage
from Avignon east to Draguignan in the hills behind the Cote
d'Azur. Conducted in sunny and breezy weather, the race was watched
by enormous crowds, especially at the start, with thousands on
Avignon's ancient walls.
</P>
<P>
   The two riders the Spaniard left in his wake were Frenchmen.
Nicolas Jalabert of the ONCE team and Pascal Herve of Polti were
second and third, 25 and 27 seconds too late respectively to save
the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was foreshadowed early despite banners encouraging
French riders. The first of the day's attacks was carried out by a
German and an Italian. After regrouping, it was the turn of
Lithuanians, Poles, Swiss, Spaniards, more Italians and Germans,
Danes and even an Australian as the French showed only tentative
initiative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a 12-man breakaway of low-ranked riders took form about 60
kilometers along, the pack was content to let the those riders go
ahead on narrow and zigzagging roads past perched villages and the
occasional vineyard. Including all the overall leaders, the main
pack arrived 10:06 behind the winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outcome changed basically nothing. Garcia-Acosta began the
day in 46th place, nearly 29 minutes behind. Nicolas Jalabert, the
younger brother of the star Laurent Jalabert, and Herve were
similarly in the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   So Lance Armstrong, the head of the U.S. Postal Service team,
remained secure in the overall leader's yellow jersey, nearly five
minutes ahead of Jan Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom and the
winner of the 1997 Tour. Joseba Beloki, a Spaniard with Festina,
was third, nearly six minutes behind in the 145-man field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the American's performances in the first two mountain
stages _ two second places and a daunting display of easy power _
none of his rivals appeared to be overly optimistic about the
coming three stages in the Alps. They begin Saturday and continue
Sunday and Tuesday, with Monday a day off.

REVISITING THE REAL `TRIAL OF THE CENTURY'
</HEADLINE>
  RESENDING TO CORRECT NAME FROM `RICHARD JACKSON' TO `ROBERT
JACKSON' IN 5th PARAGRAPH. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
As ``Nuremberg,'' TNT's laudably ambitious mini-series, takes pains
to demonstrate, the Nuremberg trials were a pivotal event in global
history. Robert Jackson (Alec Baldwin), the man who led the
prosecution, is told early on that his works ``could establish a
basis for conduct among nations that could alter history for
generations to come.'' Jackson himself later describes the work
before him as ``the secular equivalent of drafting the Ten
Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those platitudes, which really aren't that far off the
mark, the job this film sets both for itself and its protagonists
is given true dramatic heft, both emotionally and intellectually,
and for the most part, ``Nuremberg'' lives up to its billing. Yes,
it has its requisite TV-movie touches _ mercifully, the furtive
romance between Jackson and his assistant (Jill Hennessy) is dealt
with at the fringes of the drama _ and yes, at times, there's a
certain antiseptic sheen over the proceedings, a tacit
acknowledgment that this is TV dealing with Big Ideas and therefore
is best handled with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, this is important history _ and
therefore, by definition, high drama _ executed sanely and smartly
and, frequently, rivetingly.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Following World War II, the Nuremberg trials
posited the idea of war crimes, that behavior in brutally blind
obeisance to one's fatherland could in fact be immoral if a
country's leaders acted as atrociously as occurred in Germany.
While Hermann Goering poo-poo'd the proceedings as simply a case of
the winners ruthlessly lording it over the losers, the fact that
some German leaders were found ``not guilty'' suggested that this
was no kangaroo court: It was the world, as one, announcing that
some acts simply were not tolerable, even under the extreme
circumstances of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jackson led the legal charge, and though today the trial
would seem a slam-dunk, he experienced both soaring victories and
embarrassing miscues during the trial. ``Nuremberg'' is a courtroom
thriller writ large, larger than any other, and compels in its deft
combination of history and drama.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, performances skirt the stuff of
``Importance'' with a capital I. Baldwin is wonderfully understated
in a role that'd have most actors salivating for their big moments;
he makes a larger-than-life hero smaller somehow, merely human, and
therefore empathetic and winning. Matt Craven, a character actor
whose brilliance can be measured in how underappreciated his career
has been, similarly underplays his role to good effect as a Jewish
psychologist interacting with the German prisoners. Christopher
Plummer, playing a British prosecutor, does little more than wryly
beam how pleased he is to be on hand, but he does it with such dash
and elan that you're glad he's there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Brian Cox's charismatic turn as the amoral Hermann
Goering _ who disquietingly befriends an American G.I. during the
trial _ attempts to underscore how everyday Germans were seduced by
Nazism's lies. Len Cariou, as Francis Biddle, the American judge
assigned to the proceedings, humanizes his monumental pettiness.
Even Hennessy, aping fast-talking '40s movie heroines as Jackson's
inhumanly efficient assistant, manages to scratch beneath the
surface of her veneer-thin character.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter David W. Rintels has keenly telescoped a massive
story into telling segments; director Yves Simoneau has created a
rich visual tapestry against which the story is told. Note: The
last quarter of the second hour includes brutal documentary footage
of Nazi atrocities that to this day remain excruciating to watch.
But, much like Abby Mann and Stanley Kramer's 1961 Oscar winner
``Judgment at Nuremberg,'' the talents assembled have created a
compelling drama for a younger generation who can never be reminded
too much how darkly man's heart can ossify. &QL;

   SUBSTITUTE-TEACHERS (Washington) _ Substitute teachers, those
transient workers who get so little respect they might choose
Rodney Dangerfield as a spokesman, are having their first national
conference, part of a scattershot effort to lobby for better pay,
benefits and working conditions that has led to unionization in a
handful of areas. The conference comes amid the most severe
shortage of substitute teachers in recent memory, as districts
scramble to fill classrooms in an era of record-low unemployment
and high teacher absenteeism. With most students seeing subs for
more than a year of their school lives, educators are beginning to

   AIRLINE-DELAYS (Undated) _ Last summer was the worst on record
for airline delays, and this summer is shaping up to be even worse,
with delays in June up 16.5 percent over last year. No passengers
have suffered more than those flying United, the world's largest
airline. Less than 57 percent of United's flights arrived on time
in May, and the airline has had to cancel more than 7,000 flights
this year. United's problems are especially awkward now because it
is trying to acquire US Airways, a deal that would make it
responsible for carrying 25 percent of the country's passengers.
Many politicians and consumer advocates oppose the deal, and
United's operating performance is giving them added ammunition. By
Laurence Zuckerman.

   CHINA-DOTCOM-ENTREPRENEURS (Beijing) _ Hundreds of millions of
American investment dollars have fattened the bank accounts of
China's young Internet entrepreneurs in the last nine months,
making dot-com companies the most vibrant part of the country's
fledgling private sector. The torrent of cash into private hands,
unprecedented under Communist Party rule, is particularly
conspicuous given the enormous financing difficulties that many
budding Chinese entrepreneurs confront in a society that officially
discourages capitalism. If the money keeps coming, the impact could
be as big as the breakup of the country's Maoist communes 20 years
ago. A capital-backed private sector may be the economy's best hope
for survival as hundreds of millions of workers spill from sinking
state- owned enterprises and foreign competitors eagerly await
China's market opening after it joins the World Trade Organization.

</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Robust consumer demand shows few signs
of weakening, while inflationary pressures remain tame, new
economic data show. Retail sales rose 0.5 percent in June, stronger
than expected and the sharpest gain since February. May retail
sales were also revised upward, to 0.3 percent. A separate report
showed that prices paid to producers, manufacturers and farmers,
excluding energy prices, fell 0.1 percent in June, the first
decline since January. The Producer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in
June, matching forecasts. Energy prices rose 5.1 percent _ the
sharpest increase since March. A third report shows that industrial
production rose a less-than-expected 0.2 percent last month. By
Robert D. Hershey Jr.

<P>
   RAIL-MERGERS (Undated) _ An appeals court rules that federal
regulators were justified when they imposed a 15-month moratorium
on rail mergers in March. The decision was a setback for Canadian
National Railway and Burlington Northern Santa Fe whose proposed
merger to create North American's largest rail network was halted
by the moratorium. By Anthony DePalma.

   JAPAN-SOGO (Tokyo) _ Japan's finance minister said that the

&HT;     `X-MEN' RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI

<P>
   Somewhere along the way to ``X-Men's'' splashy climax,
Wolverine, a newbie mutant-superhero with major 'burns and an
attitude to match, ponders the skintight leather pantsuit he's been
required to don as a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You actually go outside in these things?'' he asks of his
similarly leathered colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you prefer?'' bolts the reply. ``Yellow spandex?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good punch line _ a perfect one, in fact _ for the
venerable X-Men, who've been fighting crime in spandex (yellow and
otherwise) for nearly four decades. If there's a cardinal rule for
live-action adaptations of beloved superheroes, it's this: Never,
ever, not if your little life depends upon it, dress them in
tights. Comic-book heroes look good in tights; human beings do not.
Either their knees look knobby or their pectorals sag.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, fortunately, occurs in ``X-Men,'' a dead-serious,
dead-smart twist on the Marvel comics series that allows for just a
touch of self-reflective humor. Letting the bunch get quippy over
spandex is one such example.
</P>
<P>
   But while X-Men fanatics may pick nits over backstory
revisionism (making Wolvering a newcomer, for instance) and cropped
characterizations, this smooth, dark and consistently entertaining
``X-Men'' stays as true to the spirit of its source material as any
comic-book adaptation since the original ``Batman.'' As such, it
ought to placate hard-core followers while pressing enough
action-movie buttons to keep X-Men ignorami sufficiently amused.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, ``X-Men'' benefits from the sure hand of
Bryan Singer, the director who brought virtuosic cleverness to
``The Usual Suspects'' and near-virtuosic creepiness to ``Apt
Pupil.'' There's nothing virtuosic about ``X-Men,'' which follows
the exploits and existentialist crises of a band of mutant
superheroes, but it does bear the stylishness and economy of a
storyteller at ease with his material. It also bears the mark of a
screenwriter (David Hayter, a lifelong ``X'' fan) who can translate
heaps of pop arcana into a cogent tale.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the X-Men's random genetic quirks give them
idiosyncratic superpowers: Storm (Halle Berry) can whip up
hurricanes, Cyclops (James Marsden) shoots laser-like blasts from
his eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has telekinetic and telepathic
abilities. The hirsute Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who's been
implanted with an ``adamantium'' alloy skeleton and 12-inch
retractable claws, boasts the ability to heal himself. This comes
in handy when Rogue (Anna Paquin), a pubescent mutant whose touch
can kill, grabs him in agony after he stabs her in the chest with
his claws. But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the X-Men is the magnificently bald Professor Xavier
(played by the magnificently bald Patrick Stewart), whose
telepathic powers and worldly-wise demeanor make him the ideal
mentor. Xavier runs a school for gifted children that's actually a
haven for mutant kids, most of whom have been rejected by a society
that looks askance at preteens who can walk through walls and cook
up fireballs with their bare hands. (Mutants: the misunderstood
minority.) Amid such prejudice it's easy to get cynical, but the
revered Professor X maintains his idealism by vowing to protect the
very Homo sapiens who reject him. Lo, the Uncanny X-Men.
</P>
<P>
   Them's the good guys. The bad guys consist of Magneto (Ian
McKellen) and his entourage, which includes a large, fanged,
growling, hairy man named Sabretooth (the aptly monikered Tyler
Mane), a revolting, reptilian-tongued acrobat named Toad (Ray Park;
watch him hang from buildings by his tongue) and, the vilest of
all, a yellow-eyed, blue-skinned shape-shifter named Mystique
(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). Magneto himself has telekinetic powers so
highly developed that he bends iron bars like overcooked linguini
and dangles metallic desk tchotchkes in thin air.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of Magneto, as any X-nut will tell you, is that
Magneto isn't entirely evil. He's _ there's that word again _
misunderstood. The film opens with a bit of personal history, as
the young Master M is split from his parents in a Nazi
concentration camp; in agony, he warps the iron fence that
separates them. This early trauma defines Magneto and makes him
triply suspicious of humanity's willingness to accept minorities. A
campaign by a xenophobic senator (played a perfectly giddy,
perfectly oily Bruce Davison) to smoke out American mutants only
fuels Magneto's paranoia. He resolves to fight humanity; Xavier
resolves to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the X-Men. Where the plot heads, exactly, won't be
revealed, though it's safe to say it involves lots of superhero
fisticuffs and fair bit of chest-heaving character development.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverine is by far the most interesting of the X-Men (fans of
the comics may mourn the absence of other X'ers), a charismatic
manimal who tosses off the best lines in the film with a Dirty
Harry rasp. Jackman even looks like a youthful Eastwood _ think
Clint with a biker-boy pompadour. Though Stewart and McKellen (who
played ``Apt Pupil's'' evil Nazi) are clearly the cast's thespian
heavyweights, Jackman commands the movie; when he's on screen, it
leaps to attention. Paquin is another standout _ in a much quieter
role _ while Romijn-Stamos, snake-like in scaly blue skin, makes
one heck of a slithering bad girl.
</P>
<P>
   Marsden, meanwhile, is monumentally dull as Cyclops, who's
always been a stuffed shirt but here comes across as too young and
too callow to save supermarket coupons, much less the world. Berry
certainly looks the part of Storm _ that white hair! that milky
glow in her eyes when she conjures a gale! _ but has only a couple
of eensy-weensy scenes and doesn't register much of an impression.
Janssen's Jean Grey (known in previous comic incarnations as Marvel
Girl and Phoenix) fares slightly better, striking a few sparks with
Wolverine that might get sexy in the next film.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be a next film. Don't even doubt it; the
filmmakers didn't, having crafted a deliberately open-ended coda.
Certainly the whoops and cheers that went up at the close of the
preview bode well for the box office and scream (as such things do,
these days) ``looming sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   As a well-hyped summer flick with plentiful action and a
fanciful plot, ``X-Men'' will make boodles of money. As a
well-crafted, entertaining film that never skids into camp, it
deserves to.

&HT;     `BLOOD SIMPLE' IS BACK, TENSE AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a tale from the crypt penned by James M. Cain, Joel and
Ethan Coen's ``Blood Simple'' has resurrected itself in taut,
super-tense fashion, and is a somewhat noticeable eight minutes
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   The film elbows tastefulness until it leaves a bruise. Its
squinting, self-aware cockiness that was so bracing two decades ago
has had a cancerous effect on independent filmmaking. The
staggering truth of ``Blood Simple,'' however, is that the Coens
had the formal elan, stylistic arrogance and intellectual daring to
back up their prankishness. The brothers wanted to tell a
simple-but-corkscrewed story of a jealous bar owner who hires a
private eye to kill his wife and her lover. And they wound up
mistaking Texas for a confederacy of dunces and the sweaty bowels
of hell, forging their most organically terrifying experiment in
sideways storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   The whole dusty, humid landscape is satanically alive, as though
there were a road that leads from the open highway to the devil's
mouth, with poor, dim John Getz seemingly uncertain about from
where hysteria will next emerge. The camera work was by first-time
cinematographer (later turned director) Barry Sonnenfeld, and it's
God's own sight gag, rambunctiously oozing around corners, climbing
over some drunk passed out at the bar, colluding with the
low-budget production design to cast the perfect shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, ``Blood Simple'' is the nightmare that films noir like
``Detour'' were always allusively damming off. It's of the same sin
that wrought ``Chinatown'' (1975) and ``Reservoir Dogs'' (1992).
What begins as a crime thriller tops itself off as a supremely
inverted horror film curdled with a touch of evil.
</P>
<P>
   The film really takes off at the midway point or just about the
time that you realize the sound of a heart beating in a body bag is
an enervated ceiling fan. And from a sheer shock and suspense
standpoint, the final sequence is the tightest, most unrelenting of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hedaya, as the jealous husband, was laying the groundwork
for the grumbling goons he'd play over the next 16 years. And,
looking like a Kmart Jessica Lange, Frances McDormand exhibits a
Jamie Lee Curtis-like gift for hyperventilation. As the
batter-dipped detective, M. Emmet Walsh, potbellied and sweating
through a canary-yellow suit, is the undead (or the extremely hard
to kill). The fly that buzzes around has rightly pegged him for
carrion.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews quibbled with ``Blood Simple's'' lack of
compassion and facetious bloodlessness, a charge that's stuck with
the Coen brothers, though it's only truly evident in ``The
Hudsucker Proxy.'' But in basic thrilling measure, it's the boys'
most immediately gratifying movie: The goods are delivered in a
hearse.

&HT;     CHUCK AND BUCK'S AFTER-SCHOOL PSYCHODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Part case study, part metaphor, all bidding for
your own Kinsey-scale reading, Mike White and Miguel Arteta's
``Chuck and Buck'' is a thumb-sucking entry in the ``I don't wanna
grow up'' sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The film comes on like an ``After School Special'' psychodrama
that's been taken off its medication. Written by White, it gambols
along in the latent boyhood intimacy between friends that
evaporates in the ether of adulthood. Still skipping along in
pre-adolescence, 27-year-old Buck (White) is willfully mired in his
10-year-old self. He sucks on Blow Pops and displays an unsettling
affinity for ``Children's Television Workshop'' fashion, while
living in a time capsule of a bedroom in his childhood home with
his mother, who dies suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Her funeral is an opportunity for Buck to reacquaint himself
with his profoundly estranged best-friend, Chuck (Chris Weitz,
producer of ``American Pie''), who, in the 17 years since they've
seen each other, prefers to be called Charlie. That look of
constipated woe Chuck wears suggests it's been 17 light-years.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives at the funeral accompanied by his fiancee, Carlyn
(Beth Colt), who treats the cumbersome resumption of the Chuck-Buck
relationship with bouts of suspicion, fascination and cluelessness.
She invites Buck to come visit them in Los Angeles, where Charlie
works as a music executive. Incapable of exercising a modicum of
self-control, Buck moves _ into the Little Prince motel, where he
transplants the kitsch museum that was his old room _ and commences
stalking Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   It's with a sneer that I disclose that White used to write for
``Dawson's Creek,'' and there's a sleepy-smirking quality about him
that makes him look like he's just climbed in through James Van Der
Beek's window. He looks like that kid who's always in search of a
rave _ or Legoland.
</P>
<P>
   He's a fey idiot who reaches out to '60s underground-movie star
Taylor Mead by way of sketch-comedy jester Chris Elliot. Arteta,
who also made the similarly bizarre but queasier ``Star Maps,'' has
fashioned neither a drama nor satire per se. The film, shot
pristinely on digital video, keeps an odd, but mercifully straight
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and Buck'' teems with regrettable corniness but also
with droll wish-fulfillment in this dreamlike exorcism of White's
personal and Hollywood demons neatly arranged in its own
``Dawson's''-like format. Buck manages to mount the ballad of Chuck
and Buck called ``Hank and Frank'' at a community theater. It's a
play that the theater's production manager (Lupe Ontiveros, whose
rationale the film could have used more of) tags a ``homoerotic,
misogynistic love story.'' (Her analysis sails over his head.)
</P>
<P>
   Further, but brilliantly caught in the throes of his own
reflexivity, Buck carries on with the two actors playing Chuck as a
child and as an adult in his play (one of whom is played by Weitz's
older brother, Paul). He's not simply exploiting trauma, he's
trying, gingerly, to get into its pants.

<P>
   Deadline after deadline has slipped by since Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, under
U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at
the tail end of his presidential authority. This, above all else,
has dictated the timing of the crucial summit between Clinton,
Arafat and Israel's current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp
David, giving it sudden now-or-never urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Now or never also tripped off the tongue in 1978 when President
Jimmy Carter invited Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem
Begin to the presidential hideaway. But the prospect of an
Israeli-Arab peace was then new and startling: the three leaders
were explorers in an unknown land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis, by contrast, have been tramping
the land for a decade, at the Madrid conference even before the
Oslo peace track revealed itself in 1993. They have surveyed every
inch of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But since so many of their demands are incompatible, this
knowledge is not necessarily an advantage. Both Barak and Arafat
have to be able to leave Camp David declaring victory, or at least
seeing it in prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs a deal that enables Israelis to feel secure from
attack, their nation undiminished. Arafat needs a deal that offers
West Bankers and Gazans a respectable-seeming independent state
while not ignoring the concerns of the Palestinian diaspora and the
wider Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader can get away with less, for neither has the
domestic strength of his Camp David predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Begin had the huge advantage of coming from the right. Sadat had
a dictator's powers _ though he, like Israel's Rabin, was later
murdered by his own people for his belief in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has seen his coalition collapse in the face of a deal. It
put him in an awkward position, as he squeakily survived a vote of
no-confidence this week. But he may, in fact, be better off without
his departed partners: they were a mixed, narrow-minded lot,
endlessly squabbling and horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government had reached the point when bargaining
with its own component parts often took precedence over negotiation
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has the personal strength to rise above his domestic
political bazaar. If he can make a fair deal and present it to his
people, including his Palestinian-born people, in a referendum, he
stands a good chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis have much more on their minds than the boring business
with the Palestinians, and most of them want to see an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has the opposite problem. Free of Barak's democratic
restraints, he should have little trouble pushing a deal through
his loyalist administration.
</P>
<P>
   His people are another matter. Palestinians outside the
territories have always opposed the Oslo peace track, mainly
because it touches only lightly on their overriding interest: the
right of their return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Now West Bankers and Gazans, too, are skeptical of a process
that has brought few of them much freedom and has made most of them
much poorer.
</P>
<P>
   A central difficulty is that the Israelis believe that
concessions must start from the current situation, whereas the
Palestinians believe they have already made a vast concession by
accepting an embryo state amounting to little more than one-fifth
of mandated Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they will have to concede a lot more. But if the end
result fails to win widespread West Bank and Gazan backing, the
initiative could pass to Palestinian rejectionists.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers, with their violent Islamist elements, will never
be satisfied with anything Arafat can get. The hope is that the
rejectionists can be marginalized in the framework of general
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The now-or-never label notwithstanding, the summit could end
inconclusively. The stumble towards peace could then continue. If,
at worst, failure cannot be disguised, the consequences will be
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has promised to declare an independent state by Sept. 13.
He made a similar promise last year, only to retreat under
pressure. A second broken promise is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has threatened, in return, to annex the land on which
Jewish settlements have been built. No doubt, after a while, the
two sides would start talking once again. But it would be a

<P>
   Deadline after deadline has slipped by since Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, under
U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at
the tail end of his presidential authority. This, above all else,
has dictated the timing of the crucial summit between Clinton,
Arafat and Israel's current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp
David, giving it sudden now-or-never urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Now or never also tripped off the tongue in 1978 when President
Jimmy Carter invited Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem
Begin to the presidential hideaway. But the prospect of an
Israeli-Arab peace was then new and startling: the three leaders
were explorers in an unknown land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis, by contrast, have been tramping
the land for a decade, at the Madrid conference even before the
Oslo peace track revealed itself in 1993. They have surveyed every
inch of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But since so many of their demands are incompatible, this
knowledge is not necessarily an advantage. Both Barak and Arafat
have to be able to leave Camp David declaring victory, or at least
seeing it in prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs a deal that enables Israelis to feel secure from
attack, their nation undiminished. Arafat needs a deal that offers
West Bankers and Gazans a respectable-seeming independent state
while not ignoring the concerns of the Palestinian diaspora and the
wider Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   Neither leader can get away with less, for neither has the
domestic strength of his Camp David predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Begin had the huge advantage of coming from the right. Sadat had
a dictator's powers _ though he, like Israel's Rabin, was later
murdered by his own people for his belief in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has seen his coalition collapse in the face of a deal. It
put him in an awkward position, as he squeakily survived a vote of
no-confidence this week. But he may, in fact, be better off without
his departed partners: they were a mixed, narrow-minded lot,
endlessly squabbling and horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government had reached the point when bargaining
with its own component parts often took precedence over negotiation
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has the personal strength to rise above his domestic
political bazaar. If he can make a fair deal and present it to his
people, including his Palestinian-born people, in a referendum, he
stands a good chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis have much more on their minds than the boring business
with the Palestinians, and most of them want to see an end to it.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has the opposite problem. Free of Barak's democratic
restraints, he should have little trouble pushing a deal through
his loyalist administration.
</P>
<P>
   His people are another matter. Palestinians outside the
territories have always opposed the Oslo peace track, mainly
because it touches only lightly on their overriding interest: the
right of their return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Now West Bankers and Gazans, too, are skeptical of a process
that has brought few of them much freedom and has made most of them
much poorer.
</P>
<P>
   A central difficulty is that the Israelis believe that
concessions must start from the current situation, whereas the
Palestinians believe they have already made a vast concession by
accepting an embryo state amounting to little more than one-fifth
of mandated Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they will have to concede a lot more. But if the end
result fails to win widespread West Bank and Gazan backing, the
initiative could pass to Palestinian rejectionists.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers, with their violent Islamist elements, will never
be satisfied with anything Arafat can get. The hope is that the
rejectionists can be marginalized in the framework of general
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The now-or-never label notwithstanding, the summit could end
inconclusively. The stumble towards peace could then continue. If,
at worst, failure cannot be disguised, the consequences will be
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has promised to declare an independent state by Sept. 13.
He made a similar promise last year, only to retreat under
pressure. A second broken promise is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has threatened, in return, to annex the land on which
Jewish settlements have been built. No doubt, after a while, the
two sides would start talking once again. But it would be a
bloodily violent while.
</P>
<P>
   When things were at their nastiest at Camp David in 1978, with
the Egyptians packing their bags to go home, Carter intervened to
knock heads together. If he is to get a deal, Clinton too may have
to knock on more than wood. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard to absorb the full reality. So far, the global AIDS
epidemic is thought to have killed 19 million people. That is
almost twice as many as died in the First World War. It has
infected another 34 million.
</P>
<P>
   When they die, as most will in the next few years, AIDS will
have killed nearly as many as the Second World War. And the
epidemic shows no signs of abating.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS, the umbrella group that coordinates the anti-AIDS effort
of various U.N. agencies, reckons that 5 million people a year are
being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   If these people were dying from bullets and bombs, they would
never be out of the headlines. Not for nothing is the slogan of the
international AIDS conference that has just taken place in Durban,
South Africa, ``break the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that drugs can ward off the effects of AIDS in people who
can afford them, the issue has slid out of sight in the rich world.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from that world, AIDS is just another disease, like
malaria, measles and mumps, which westerners can ignore in the
knowledge that they are unlikely to catch it and will not die of it
even if they do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet AIDS is not just another infection, and comparing its
victims with the casualty lists of a war is not mere rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Most diseases pick off young children and the elderly. AIDS hits
those in the prime of life. The human disaster for its victims and
their families thus feeds into a social and economic disaster for
the countries affected.
</P>
<P>
   And, with few exceptions, those countries are in Africa, a
continent that has dire enough economic and social problems
already.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes are at last starting to change. In January the
American government upgraded the threat of AIDS from one that
merely affects people's health to one that affects the security of
nations.
</P>
<P>
   James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, has declared that
there is ``no limit'' to the amount the Bank will spend on AIDS,
and it announced at the start of the conference that $500 million
is now available. And in May, five large drug companies agreed with
UNAIDS not only that something must be done, but that they might
help.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Merck, has put $50 million of its money where its
mouth is. It plans to deliver, with the Gates Foundation, an
American charity, what it claims will be a comprehensive anti-AIDS
package for Botswana, the worst-affected country of all.
</P>
<P>
   Such initiatives are welcome, even if they are a drop in the
ocean (the World Bank estimates that Africa alone may need to spend
$2.3 billion a year on the disease). But it is rarely possible for
outsiders to solve other peoples' problems.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in poor countries will not go away so long as their leaders
do not give a lead in fighting against it. And Africa's rulers,
with one or two shining exceptions, have not yet done so. Some have
simply ignored the problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, South Africa, the conference's host, is a shining bad
example. It makes angry noises at drug firms, while failing to
promote the use of medicines such as AZT and nevirapine that are
known to be effective at preventing the transmission of HIV from
mother to child at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, the country's president, who has been listening to
a small band of scientists with eccentric and discredited opinions,
has allowed doubts to linger over whether AIDS is actually caused
by HIV in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Africa has some special features. Africans are beset
by many diseases, each of which serves to weaken people and to make
them susceptible to the others. And poverty aggravates the problem,
as do incessant wars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If Africa were as rich and peaceful as Europe or America, AIDS
might by now be as rare there as elsewhere. But it is not,
ultimately, a lack of money that causes AIDS. It is a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping, or slowing, that virus is not impossible, as the
example of Uganda, which has reduced its level of infection from 14
percent to 8 percent over the past decade, shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few simple but important steps that need to be
taken. The first is to stop being squeamish about sex. AIDS is
mainly a sexually-transmitted disease. That means that people enjoy
giving it to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about sex is taboo in many African cultures. But in
places like Uganda, the taboo has been overcome. All successful
prevention campaigns have worked by preaching ways, notably the use
of condoms, that reduce the enjoyment of sex only slightly.
Campaigns that have merely preached abstinence have always failed.
</P>
<P>
   The second idea is to test pregnant women for HIV, and give them
AZT or nevirapine if they turn out to be infected. This is a rather
cheap and effective use of anti-AIDS drugs, which ought to be near
the top of even the poorest country's health budget.
</P>
<P>
   Health systems also must be better run so that the drugs are
properly administered and followed up, to minimize the risk of the
virus developing resistance. These steps, alone, could save 500,000
infant lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to help stop the spread of AIDS is to empower
women so that they can say no. This is terribly difficult in the
many patriarchal _ i.e., exploitative _ African cultures. Yet women
who are educated have a much better chance of saying no than women
who are not.
</P>
<P>
   The no does not have to be no to all sex. But it does need to be
no to unprotected sex with anybody about whose HIV status a woman
is unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Men too would benefit from better education in the dangers and
risks attached to AIDS, but education of girls is less often
attempted and yet even more important, because they are more likely
to act to slow the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   So this must be a third plank of an effective anti-AIDS
strategy: Condoms. Healthy births. And educated women. These will
not abolish AIDS. That, if it ever happens, will require effective
vaccines, and those are years away. They might, however, contain it
and stop the deaths of many of the young, vigorous people whom poor
countries need.
</P>
<P>
   Africans, and indeed all people in poor countries where the
disease has a grip, should be shouting out about these things. It
is that shout that needs to break the silence. No amount of
cheering from the sidelines by the West will do instead. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For anyone who hopes that European history is coasting towards a
happy, democratic ending, the latest news from the Balkans must
come as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, whose downfall as Yugoslav president seemed
imminent last year when his troops were driven out of Kosovo, is
tightening and perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost
none of the malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   He still knows how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be
settled peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he
hopes the West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only
person who can resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the West must do better.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional changes rushed through the Yugoslav
legislature this month are a textbook example of the Milosevic
method. The amendments were designed to make life intolerable for
Montenegro, Serbia's reluctant partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to reduce Montenegro's say in federal affairs and
thus to bounce Milo Djukanovic, the Montenegrin leader, into a
referendum on independence _ which might in turn trigger a civil
war in which Serbia could ``intervene'' without seeming to fire
first.
</P>
<P>
   For people whose purpose is served by fratricide, Montenegro
provides uniquely promising material. Like Northern Ireland, it is
a small, clannish territory whose well-armed populace is deeply,
and about evenly, divided over questions of political and cultural
identity _ which anyway have no clear-cut or rational answer.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Montenegrins firmly support independence; a
third want no loosening of the ties with Serbia; the remainder are
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   If at some time in the future, a clear majority of Montenegrins
were to vote for independence, and the republic came under attack
from Serbia, NATO would have little choice but to rally to the
smaller republic's aid. That is a political reality of which
Milosevic should be reminded as clearly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It would, however, be vastly preferable if the slide towards
confrontation could be halted at an earlier stage. Given the
reluctance of western governments to face the messiness of ground
warfare in mountainous terrain, military aid to Montenegro would
presumably take the form of air support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever such a policy achieved, it would not be able _ on past
evidence _ to prevent retaliatory killings on a horrific scale in
Montenegro's highlands, and it might well exacerbate them.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, a storming NATO intervention would seem
less bad than doing nothing; but everything possible should be done
to stop such circumstances arising.
</P>
<P>
   How can the risk be reduced? Hitherto, western policy has aimed,
sensibly enough, at calming the political atmosphere through modest
economic aid and quiet security help for Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has cushioned the effects of Serbia's blockade, this
aid has not so far been effective enough to convince a clear
majority of Montenegrins that their interests are served by
pro-western policies.
</P>

<P>
   For anyone who hopes that European history is coasting towards a
happy, democratic ending, the latest news from the Balkans must
come as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, whose downfall as Yugoslav president seemed
imminent last year when his troops were driven out of Kosovo, is
tightening and perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost
none of the malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   He still knows how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be
settled peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he
hopes the West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only
person who can resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the West must do better.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional changes rushed through the Yugoslav
legislature this month are a textbook example of the Milosevic
method. The amendments were designed to make life intolerable for
Montenegro, Serbia's reluctant partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to reduce Montenegro's say in federal affairs and
thus to bounce Milo Djukanovic, the Montenegrin leader, into a
referendum on independence _ which might in turn trigger a civil
war in which Serbia could ``intervene'' without seeming to fire
first.
</P>
<P>
   For people whose purpose is served by fratricide, Montenegro
provides uniquely promising material. Like Northern Ireland, it is
a small, clannish territory whose well-armed populace is deeply,
and about evenly, divided over questions of political and cultural
identity _ which anyway have no clear-cut or rational answer.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Montenegrins firmly support independence; a
third want no loosening of the ties with Serbia; the remainder are
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   If at some time in the future, a clear majority of Montenegrins
were to vote for independence, and the republic came under attack
from Serbia, NATO would have little choice but to rally to the
smaller republic's aid. That is a political reality of which
Milosevic should be reminded as clearly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It would, however, be vastly preferable if the slide towards
confrontation could be halted at an earlier stage. Given the
reluctance of western governments to face the messiness of ground
warfare in mountainous terrain, military aid to Montenegro would
presumably take the form of air support.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever such a policy achieved, it would not be able _ on past
evidence _ to prevent retaliatory killings on a horrific scale in
Montenegro's highlands, and it might well exacerbate them.
</P>
<P>
   In some circumstances, a storming NATO intervention would seem
less bad than doing nothing; but everything possible should be done
to stop such circumstances arising.
</P>
<P>
   How can the risk be reduced? Hitherto, western policy has aimed,
sensibly enough, at calming the political atmosphere through modest
economic aid and quiet security help for Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has cushioned the effects of Serbia's blockade, this
aid has not so far been effective enough to convince a clear
majority of Montenegrins that their interests are served by
pro-western policies.
</P>
<P>
   With the Djukanovic government keeping a tight hold on the
economy, some citizens suspect their leader of using the standoff
with Serbia for his own political purposes _ and they blame the
West for abetting him.
</P>
<P>
   A worse problem is that in Serbia, too, people doubt whether the
West really would help them economically if they ousted Milosevic.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ For most of this campaign, Vice President Al Gore
has been suffering from multiple personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He can be an alpha male, a caring environmentalist or an
international statesman, depending on the time of day. Trying to
raise doubts about whether he knows who he is, wired Republicans
have taken to calling his latest pronouncements ``Gore 7.0.''
</P>
<P>
   They ask when the real Al Gore will please stand up. And the
answer may be: now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a new model candidate has been road-tested.
With this version, Gore may at last have settled on something he
can take to the voters in November. It may even work.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Gore in Chicago: ``I'm on your side and I want to fight
for the people. The other side fights for the powerful. That's why
the big pharmaceutical companies are supporting Governor Bush.
That's why the big oil companies are supporting Governor Bush.
That's why the big polluters are supporting Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this, from Connecticut: ``I've stood up to the big drug
companies, the big oil companies, the insurance companies and the
HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this, from Lexington, Ky.: ``On behalf of those people _ not
just the ones who think comfortably about their savings over scotch
in the club looking out at the golf links, but also the ones...on
the factory floor _ we will take the White House in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's Al Gore, class warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Abusing the rich is hardly unprecedented in America. Teddy
Roosevelt made a career of it. But it is unusual. And, at the
moment, it looks uncommonly risky.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to aspire upwards and disdain down. At a time
when 87 percent of voters say they admire people who get rich by
working hard and when the new economy is producing millions of
footloose voters who are pro-business and could not care less about
traditional party ideology, Gore's populist rhetoric makes him
sound like one of those generals busy fighting the last war.
</P>
<P>
   He risks irrelevance. He also risks losing the money he needs to
prosecute his campaign _ which, sadly, has to come from those same
villains of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president is a peculiar sort of class warrior. In
the past, populists have usually combined their attacks on the rich
with proposals to upset the status quo by, for example, taking the
railways into public ownership, or by increasing income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not like this. To say he supports the economic status
quo does not do justice to his conservatism. Prudence is his
watchword. It is, he keeps telling people, the reason why the
economy has been such a success and why it cannot be entrusted to
the dangerous Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president has become more bountiful with his
spending plans of late (in response to the rising budget surplus),
in general his economic policy is every bit as cautious as his
rhetoric is extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the same day Gore was denouncing oil and drug
companies in Chicago, the Democratic Party in Washington was
issuing its draft platform, or manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Clintonian document: fiscally disciplined, cautious,
trade-opening, technology-promoting and business-friendly _ i.e.,
everything populists are not. The New Democrats, the centrists of
the party to which Gore belongs, loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's split personality is hardly unique. Most
politicians are torn between populism, to please the party
diehards, and moderation, to attract the wavering middle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' for example, attempts to
reconcile supporters on the right and in the center. If the Texan's
alliteration-loving publicists worked for the Democrats, Gore's new
program would no doubt be dubbed ``progressive pragmatism.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the vice-president's political schizophrenia seems to run
deeper than normal.
</P>
<P>
   It shows up, for example, in his environmental record, where the
deep-green radicalism of his book, ``Earth in the Balance,''
contrasts with his more pragmatic record in office. It consorts
with his campaigning style and beliefs in almost every election he
has fought _ the first abrasive, the second cautious.
</P>
<P>
   A split personality would make Gore a poor president (assuming,
that is, that it affected his behavior in an office where
consistency is essential). But it does not necessarily make him a
poor candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So far, his targets (oil and drug companies and HMOs) have been
so unpopular that not even Bush has stood up to defend them. As
long as Gore's class-based rhetoric does not become so strident
that it puts off more people than it attracts, then it has several
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sallies against big business help shore up his left wing
against the challenge of Ralph Nader and the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have been less than enthusiastic about the vice president
because of his support for trade with China. By portraying himself
as a fighter for the common man against big business, Gore might
reconcile some of them to his candidacy again _ and get out the
blue-collar vote.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Gore's populism is a nice way of negating Bush's claim to
be a ``new kind of Republican.'' It does this directly, by painting
him as a traditional big-business Republican who cares about fat
cats rather than the public.
</P>
<P>
   It also does so indirectly, by narrowing the gap Bush has tried
to create between himself and the congressional Republicans, who
are far less popular than he is. Gore combines his anti-business
broadsides with side-thrusts at the ``do-nothing-for-the-people
Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Gore's combination of populist rhetoric and centrist
policies presents him with a way around that occupational hazard
facing all vice presidents: how to distinguish yourself from your
predecessor, without losing the credit for his achievements, or
seeming disloyal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corporate ranting is certainly different from Bill
Clinton, who rarely indulges in such old-fashioned attacks. It also
provides one or two new, popular promises (to reduce the cost of
drugs and fuel). And it does so without seriously compromising
Gore's claim to fiscal rectitude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is still a long way to go before November _ and it may
prove hard to prevent Gore's class-based rhetoric overwhelming his
policy restraint. But, though he is venturing down a risky road,
inconsistency is already making him a better candidate. &QL;

PENTAGON MISSES THE TETHERED CHICKEN

<P>
   As technical failures go, this one could hardly have been more
humiliating. Before conducting the third test of its ``mini-Star
Wars'' system intended to smash up enemy warheads in space, the
Pentagon had given careful warnings that the whole project was a
``high-risk'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, meanwhile, had questioned the honesty of the test,
arguing that it was far too easy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with a real-life onslaught by a rogue state, the
designers of the intercepting missile would know the time and
source of the incoming missile; they would also know all about the
single, crude decoy that would be released at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, a bit like hitting a tethered chicken.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, barely a feather flew. The missile test on July 7
suffered a failure so fundamental that it did not even figure among
the various ``high-risk'' scenarios the Pentagon had worried about.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepting missile refused to separate from its booster
rocket, so no collision was attempted; and in a separate setback,
the decoy balloon did not inflate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) is
still at an early stage in its program of 19 tests. But the
experiment was a politically sensitive one on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has said its outcome will help him to
decide whether to launch an anti-missile program before his
presidency ends. If he does so, that would have momentous
diplomatic consequences. In particular it might mean breaking out
of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which the Russians and
Chinese hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   From this perspective, you might have imagined that the failure
would be greeted with relief by the Clinton administration. In
fact, the test weakens its diplomatic leverage with the Russians _
and reduces the chances that they will accept America's proposed
amendments to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Clinton and, particularly, Al Gore will remain exposed to
Republican allegations that the administration has not pursued
anti-missile defenses with sufficient zeal.
</P>

   Military analysts are asking questions not just about the
competence of the BMDO and its contractors, but about the concept
itself. Richard Garwin, a missile-defense expert, thinks the test
adds weight to the view that the missiles should be intercepted
soon after they are launched, not in space.

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland - On grassy patch along the Corcrain
Road in a ramshackle Protestant neighborhood here, the flames were
still burning Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   These were the remnants of Tuesday night's immense bonfire _
which was topped with an orange, green and white Irish flag and an
effigy of a Northern Irish policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story blaze of scrap lumber, pallets and old furniture
_ there were even kitchen cabinets complete with metal sinks _
added a hellish light to the night's tumultuous edition of the
riots that have plagued this year's marching season.
</P>
<P>
   To repel an assault of the brick, beer-bottle and
gasoline-bomb-wielding mob _ composed in part of neighborhood
children _ police employed water cannons, batons and fired rubber
bullets. There were injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was remarkable not only for its violence but because
it involved a largely Protestant mob attacking a largely Protestant
security force.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was the Catholic nationalists _ people aligned
with the Irish Republican Army's struggle to unite Northern Ireland
with the Republic of Ireland _ who warred with the police and army.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the new frustrations bedeviling the fragile
peace process _ those of Protestants, who now believe they are
being trampled at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday morning, a lone man, who appeared to be in his mid
50s, walked past the scorched field, where there had been no
apparent effort at a clean-up. Tucked under his arm was an
oil-stained brown paper bag of fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you look at the rubbish, then,'' said David Frew, who has
lived in the area for 38 years. ``But you must know that this is
all the fault of the government and the nationalists who have tried
to kill our culture. When the IRA does violence, they get what they
want. That's what the young boys have learnt from your peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   While the peace seems to have again survived the marching
season, the uncommon nastiness of the 12-day period confirmed that
the province is a long way from resolving the blood feud that has
claimed 3,600 lives over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, which climaxed on July 12 _ known universally
as The Twelfth _Protestants hold about 2,700 parades across
Northern Ireland to celebrate King William of Orange's 310-year-old
victory of over his rival Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   The 1690 victory created the division in Ireland between the
north, which is still a British province, and the South, which
became the Republic of Ireland in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The catalogue of violence for this year's season, which began
July 1 and ended Thursday, provides chilling proof of how far the
province is from attaining a peace that U.S. President Bill Clinton
desperately wants to claim as part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the period, there were 329 attacks on security forces,
injuring 81 police officers and six soldiers, police said. There
were 305 incidents involving gasoline bombs. It could have been
worse: Police recovered 1,000 bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five homes, 75 commercial or public premises and 404 cars
were damaged, and 105 vehicles were hijacked. Security forces fired
19 plastic bullets, 217 people were arrested and 87 have been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   While there were reports of a few stabbings, one man died after
being shot in the back of his head near a bonfire Tuesday night in
the port city of Larne. Local newspapers have reported that he may
have been killed for singing a song that may have offended some
Protestant militants.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders have been shocked by what they consider an
appropriation by hooligans of their respectable celebration. Some
fear that the organization's leaders have done too little to stop
the lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see people blocking traffic with pints of beer in their
hands, that was not the organization I joined,'' said William
Brown, a longtime Orange Order leader. ``Good people have only to
do nothing to let bad men succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Irish and British leaders take heart that the recently
reinstated Northern Ireland Assembly _ the Protestant/Catholic
alliance created to assume governmental control _ survived, there
were signs that the broad public support for the 2-year-old peace
process was fraying.
</P>
<P>
   Support among Protestants for the 1998 Good Friday accord _
which established the peace process _ was waning, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conversations with ordinary Unionists produced remarks such
as 'Peace - what peace?', 'I'm not a Paisley-ite (referring to the
radical Protestant leader Ian Paisley), but he speaks a lot of
truth', and most tellingly, 'If a referendum were held now, there
would be no majority in favor of the Good Friday Agreement,'''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rodgers, an Orange Order leader in Belfast, believes
Protestants are reacting to the inclusion of Sinn Fein _ the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army _ to the assembly
before the IRA surrendered its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, which like unionist paramilitaries is observing a
cease-fire, says it has placed its weapons beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants believe the Good Friday Agreement has been
implemented in a way that has favored nationalist Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of frustration out there, and I have never
experienced anger like it,'' Rodgers said. ``I don't condone it,
but some Protestants see Sinn Fein in government after IRA violence
and they think if it worked for them, why not for us?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dudley Edwards, a Dublin-based author who has written about
the Orange Order, believes the organization is in danger of
``committing suicide'' over its internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-agreement faction is determined to push out the
pro-agreement faction,'' she said. ``At the top there is a great
sense of drift and a concentration on negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The division was obvious Thursday, when national Orange Order
leaders asked for an end to a virulent protest over the
government's decision to ban them from marching through the
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Orange Order leaders in Portadown vowed to continue their
protest _ which has been cited as the spark that ignited the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange Order leader Robert Saulters said Friday that he was
worried that support for the organization was disintegrating
because of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had enough,'' Saulters said. ``I think it's time
we sat back and reflected.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed deep frustration that his concerns were being
ignored by hard-liners. ``They are not playing the game with us at
all,'' he told the BBC.

 &HT;    ROW OVER RUSSIAN ARMY RESTRUCTURING ERUPTS AMONG GENERALS
 &HT;    (475&AMP;ADD).
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIZHNY TAGILL, Russia _ A squabble among Russia's top brass
about the future of the armed forces spilled over into the public
arena Friday as President Vladimir Putin and his generals attended
a major arms show aimed at spit-shining the military's image.
</P>
<P>
   Military and national security leaders have for months struggled
over ways to restructure the armed forces, and resuscitate the
country's military industrial complex as part of Putin's
overarching goal to overhaul the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, competing proposals came to light during a
closed-door meeting, when Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin, a career
army man, recommended the elimination of the strategic nuclear
forces as a separate branch of the military and folding it under
one of the remaining three.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly described the standing army as in a ``near
critical'' state and suggested savings from cuts in the nuclear
branch could be used to re-equip and better train conventional
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan erupted publicly Friday, when Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, who made his career in the strategic
forces, said that a move like this would be a ``crime against
Russia and just plain madness,'' according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the Urals Expo 2000 here Friday, Putin tried to
quell the row among the generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The discussion of restructuring) involves a major,
fundamental decision upon which the country's future depends. Such
a decision cannot be made behind closed doors, but nor can it be
opened up to nationwide debate,'' the president said, adding that
no decision was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   If Kvashnin's measure is adopted, it would disrupt the
international balance of nuclear forces and represent a 180-degree
about-face in the strategic policy of the country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking from the history of parity with the United States
would be a major development,'' said military analyst Nicholai
Novichkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Nizhny Tagill arms show, held at a formerly secret military
base 900 miles from Moscow, was an apt illustration of problems
resulting from the last 10 years during which both the military and
military industrial complex were chronically underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's leading arms manufacturers paraded in front a deadly
arsenal of conventional weapons to about 100 international buyers,
few if any new technologies were exhibited or demonstrated.
Instead, the focus was on presenting modifications of time-honored,
reliable standbys, like the Kalashnikov rifle and the T-90 tank.
Soldiers and factory workers both complained of receiving late
wages, and companies said their future looked grim.
</P>
<P>
   While both generals, Putin and analysts agree that the military
needs to be restructured, just how to do this remains a thorny
problem, involving personal egos, varying ideas of how to protect
national security and a lack of money to pay for changes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the 1.2 million-strong military is organized into
ground, air, naval and strategic forces, which oversee the nuclear
arsenal and are the cornerstone of the Soviet Union's military and
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian weapons makers exhibiting their wares at the arms expo
said their future relied on the government jump-starting weapons
procurement not on one-time sales to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem if the government doesn't resume orders,''
said Vyscheslav Azingareev, the marketing director of the
Chelyabinsk Automatic Mechanical Enterprise, which makes artillery
shells. ``Russia has a saying that if a country doesn't feed its
own army, it will end up feeding another. It's a matter of pride
that we survive these times.''

   CHICAGO _ One way to test the buoyancy of Nasdaq is to observe
the blouses and trousers of America. With their investment accounts
swelling, Americans have been laying out more money than ever for
tucks, lifts, implants, peels, injections and assorted
``augmentations.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS),
the number of cosmetic surgical procedures grew almost as quickly
as the Dow _ from 413,000 in 1992 to over 1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procedures are within the grasp of everyday folks,'' says Dr.
Lin Puckett, a practitioner who is also the ASPS's president.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the complaints about the bubble economy, the
most common body upgrade is liposuction, a surgical procedure in
which fat is suctioned from beneath the skin with a vacuum machine.
Doctors performed over 170,000 liposuction procedures in 1998, more
than three times as many as in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger breasts are also in demand now that safer saline implants
have replaced silicone. The number of breast-augmentation surgeries
increased 306 percent between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After these, the most common procedures are eyelid surgery (up
102 percent over the same period), facelifts (up 77 percent), and
chemical peels (up 246 percent).
</P>
<P>
   No part of the body is beyond improvement. There are buttock
lifts, chin augmentations, anti-wrinkle injections and even cheek
implants.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are women the only ones seeking technological assistance.
Men account for roughly 10 percent of all cosmetic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Such vanity is not risk-free. The husband of a prominent Chicago
socialite died earlier this year after cosmetic facial surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has just approved saline breast
implants for continued use, but it notes that the devices have a
high failure rate; roughly one in six women require a second
surgical procedure within three years of receiving the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Such surgery is not covered by health insurance. The average
breast augmentation costs over $3,000; a buttock lift is slightly
more. Liposuction fees average $1,900 per ``site.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is lucrative for doctors; since patients pay up front,
there is no haggling with HMOs over paperwork or reimbursement
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons have traditionally done America's
body-sculpting, but dermatologists, ophthalmologists and other
doctors are expanding their cosmetic offerings and advertising
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet teems with proselytizers for neat buns, boobs and
chins. People are bombarded by radio advertisements that begin, ``I
used to be self-conscious about my appearance...''
</P>
<P>
   The until-recently booming stock market is not the only reason
for all this nipping and tucking. Another factor is the demographic
bulge. The baby-boomers are reaching the age where assorted body
parts are feeling (and worse, showing) the effects of time and
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest segments of the market is ``facial
rejuvenation.'' The typical patient, says Dr. Puckett, is from
``married middle-class America.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to flirt with eternal youth for such folk is strong.
But can it survive another plunge in the Nasdaq? &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ ``Would you mind opening the boot (trunk)?'' The
guards at the vehicle entrance to the massive, ugly complex of
offices that are the headquarters of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) were never especially security-conscious.
But after the party's historic defeat at the hands of Vicente Fox
in the presidential election on July 2, they have become so.
</P>
<P>
   Not because they worry about what visitors may bring into the
PRI's offices. Rather, they are making sure that nobody takes
anything away. The risk of staff sneaking off with office
equipment, however, is the most trivial of the PRI's problems.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling Mexico since 1929, the party faces an unprecedented
task: it must not only find new leaders, but a new identity and
methods to sustain it in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the PRI will retain a big presence in Congress and state
government, its ability _ or failure _ to reinvent itself will be
important to the stability of Fox's Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new president will not be sworn in until Dec. 1. But already
the battle over the PRI's future has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The party's disconcerted state was summed up last week when
Dulce Maria Sauri, the PRI's chairwoman, and other party officials
offered to resign, only to backtrack hours later.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the PRI's traditional facade of public unity
has been punctured by open sniping and squabbling. Many of the
PRI's lower ranks blame their defeat on President Ernesto Zedillo.
Others point the finger at their uninspiring presidential
candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PRI's ills lie deeply in its political genes. Born
as the National Revolutionary Party, it was an attempt to provide
stability by uniting under a single banner hundreds of factions,
interest groups and small political parties thrown up by Mexico's
1910-17 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, and for many years, it was extraordinarily
successful. Yet its traditional strengths have become weaknesses:
the division between party and state was blurred and the PRI had no
clear ideology save that of power.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did each president impose his own policies on the PRI,
but he acted as the party's supreme arbiter, choosing its top
officials, while balancing and holding together an elaborate web of
interests to ensure the system's perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   So the first problem the PRI must confront is the vacuum created
by its loss of the presidency. But that is likely to overlap with
the policy battle.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and his two predecessors each pursued broadly liberal
economic policies which challenged corporatist traditions, and hurt
interest-groups such as labor and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's most obvious divide is between the ``technocrats'' who
came to dominate central government, and the traditionalist
``dinosaurs,'' who include many state governors. Labastida is in
fact an intermediate figure between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   But defeat tars with a broad brush. Labastida and his campaign
team, who included a few ``dinosaurs,'' as well as Zedillo and his
cabinet, are now equally discredited.
</P>
<P>
   And defeat has tarnished Zedillo's ``neo-liberal'' policies too.
These gave Mexico macroeconomic stability and new growth, but
increased the rich-poor gap and landed taxpayers with an expensive
bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   A more reflective analysis would note that the PRI was defeated
from its right, not its left, and that Fox might turn out to be as
``neo-liberal'' as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI's mood is rebellious. ``Many people are angry with
Zedillo and have stopped obeying him,'' says Ernesto Ramirez, a
young civil servant who has spent 14 years as a PRI activist, and
calls himself a ``babysaur.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dinosaurs are now in a strong position, it is partly
because without the presidency the PRI's most powerful officials
will be its state governors and the bosses of the big pro-PRI trade
unions, such as those of the oil workers, telephone workers,
electricians and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, to get all the PRI's factions to
support Labastida's campaign, many old-timers were offered places
on the party's congressional lists.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost, they did not: the PRI will no longer have an
absolute majority in the Senate, but it will still be the largest
single party in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That could make it hard for Fox to cut the deals he will need in
the legislature, if the PRI stays united. Will it? The first test
will come in internal elections, to be held probably in November. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a meeting with Zedillo on July 11, the PRI's state governors
agreed that Sauri should stay on as party chairman to prepare these
elections _ but with an advisory committee of the party's former
chairmen to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the PRI's executive resigned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   A dissident group of seven state governors, led by Roberto
Madrazo from the southeastern state of Tabasco, want a new election
for the PRI's 300-member national council, and not just for the
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo is tipped by some as the PRI's likely new leader. He was
Labastida's main challenger in last year's primary for the PRI's
presidential candidacy, which brought him national prominence and a
campaign network.
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Ramirez are already being invited to meetings
organized to push his bid for the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Madrazo at the helm worries many. Though he is
relatively young and talks of modernizing and democratizing the
party, his record speaks of a return to the old methods: his
election to the governorship in 1994 was so dogged by accusations
of overspending that Zedillo tried, but failed, to make him step
down.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Madrazo's own state elects a new governor. Should
the PRI lose, as it may, his credibility will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the PRI leadership will have to try to keep the
party together while working out a new set of policies, and seeking
new sources of funds. Without the patronage of central government,
and the largesse that flowed from it, many supporters may drift
away.
</P>
<P>
   Having relied in the past on the vote in rural areas, the party
has to make a special effort to attract young and middle-class
voters _ not something the dinosaurs are obviously well-placed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   More important than any new ideology, therefore, could be the
party's performance where it still has power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can't achieve good government at the municipal and state
level, it doesn't have a future,'' says Javier Trevino, a former
adviser to Labastida. ``That's what the old-timers don't want to
see.'' But that also gives Fox some leverage with which to gain
legislative allies. &QL;

EU APPOINTS PANEL TO REVIEW AUSTRIA FOR POSSIBLE END OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Five months after the European Union imposed sanctions
on Austria to protest the inclusion of members of a far-right party
in the Austrian government, machinery giving everyone a face-saving
way to end the diplomatic freeze is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts has been named to study Austria's human
rights record and the political nature of Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party. Once that is done, the sanctions are to be reviewed,
and _ if the panel finds Austria does not violate civil rights _
presumably lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Austria says it wants the sanctions off by October, when all 15
European Union leaders hold a summit meeting in France, although
France, the leader in imposing the diplomatic freeze on Austria,
still refuses to promise anything.
</P>
<P>
   But already there are signs of a thaw. At Bastille Day
celebrations Friday, Austria's ambassador was among the dignitaries
sharing the reviewing stand with President Jacques Chirac, a far
cry from the twists and turns that have gone on to keep Chirac out
of range of Austrian officials in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there are enormous pressures at work that are
likely to make the sanctions disappear fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, France has just taken over the rotating six-month
presidency of the European Union and both its prestige and perhaps
the timely expansion of the union are riding on its being able to
deliver on a difficult agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen countries on the runway to join the
union, the EU must overhaul its institutions or face paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for instance, most EU decisions require a unanimous
vote. That is hard enough with 15 members, but experts say it would
be virtually impossible to get anything done if there were more
members.
</P>
<P>
   With an issue like this to broker, many experts say, the tension
created by continued sanctions could be a disaster. Earlier this
month, Austrian officials threatened to use their veto to block any
sort of progress. This week, they seemed to back down, perhaps
judging how unpopular such a stand would make them. But analysts
say a failure to resolve the problem could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was French I would be worried,'' said Charles Grant, a
political analyst with the Center for European Reform in London.
``These issues are always brokered as a package. You don't want one
country that is not really trying to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the sanctions remain unanimously in force with
14 members refusing to meet Austrian officials at anything more
than a ``technical level,'' many European Union countries have
indicated that they would like to see the situation resolved.
Currently, France, Belgium and Holland are considered to be the
only hold outs calling for the sanctions to continue.
</P>

<P>
   In some smaller ``euroskeptic'' countries, the freeze has been
seen as an example of big countries going after small ones for
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the fact that Italy has had far-right
politicians in its government but no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   And many point out that Chirac's enthusiastic denunciations of
Austria's Freedom Party play well at home, where Chirac is already
trying to position himself for the 2002 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   That argument is having a particular impact in Denmark, which is
considering whether or not to adopt the euro as its currency. A
referendum on the issue is to be held this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boycott could cost the vote in Denmark,'' said Grant.
``The truth is that this freeze was entered into on the spur of the
moment, and nobody thought about the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   These ripple effects are also putting pressure on France to
stand down.
</P>
<P>
   This week certainly seemed to show a softening all around.
First, Chirac invited the Austrian ambassador to the Bastille Day
celebrations. Then, the Belgians announced that they, too, would
extend a similar courtesy and invite the Austrian ambassador to
their national day celebrations July 21.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chancellor Wofgang Schuessel of Austria seemed to
be suddenly toning down his comments this week, and some analysts
suggested he already had the air of a man who had won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Brussels on Wednesday, he assured everyone that his
country would do nothing to sabotage the EU preparations for an
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words such as `threats,' `blackmail' and `veto' should be
deleted from the vocabulary,'' Schuessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel also embraced the choice of three ``wise men'' to
examine Austria's human rights record _ Martti Ahtisaari, the
former president of Finland; Jochen Frowein, director of the
Max-Plank Institute in Germany; and Marcelino Oreja, a former
Spanish minister and past member of the European Commission _ and
said they would have little problem reviewing Austrian ``commitment
to common European values.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts warned that Austria is not out of the
doghouse yet and could jeopardize the lifting of the sanctions if
it is not careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that everyone is getting ready for the
climbdown,'' said Peter Ludlow, the founding director of Center for
European Policy Studies in Brussels. ``But I'm still somewhat
skeptical of their ability to get there. ``The body language is
still not good. The Austrians better not crow too soon or too
loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his withdrawal of any threat to disrupt the coming
negotiations on expansion, Schuessel did not call off a referendum
on the EU sanctions that is planned for the fall if sanctions are
not lifted by then.
</P>
<P>
   Other EU countries have criticized the idea, fearing that the
Freedom Party will use the campaign to whip up anti-EU feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of the European Union's executive body,
Romano Prodi, who has been largely silent on the issue of the
sanctions, criticized them this week saying they should now be
ended ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said Prodi was willing to speak out now
because it was clear the sanctions had failed to achieve their
purpose and were fueling anti-EU sentiment in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in general terms that sanctions give better
results than those achieved in serious, vigorous, in-depth
dialogue.'' Prodi said.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ ``Would you mind opening the boot (trunk)?'' The
guards at the vehicle entrance to the massive, ugly complex of
offices that are the headquarters of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) were never especially security-conscious.
But after the party's historic defeat at the hands of Vicente Fox
in the presidential election on July 2, they have become so.
</P>
<P>
   Not because they worry about what visitors may bring into the
PRI's offices. Rather, they are making sure that nobody takes
anything away. The risk of staff sneaking off with office
equipment, however, is the most trivial of the PRI's problems.
</P>
<P>
   After ruling Mexico since 1929, the party faces an unprecedented
task: it must not only find new leaders, but a new identity and
methods to sustain it in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the PRI will retain a big presence in Congress and state
government, its ability _ or failure _ to reinvent itself will be
important to the stability of Fox's Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The new president will not be sworn in until Dec. 1. But already
the battle over the PRI's future has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   The party's disconcerted state was summed up last week when
Dulce Maria Sauri, the PRI's chairwoman, and other party officials
offered to resign, only to backtrack hours later.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the PRI's traditional facade of public unity
has been punctured by open sniping and squabbling. Many of the
PRI's lower ranks blame their defeat on President Ernesto Zedillo.
Others point the finger at their uninspiring presidential
candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the PRI's ills lie deeply in its political genes. Born
as the National Revolutionary Party, it was an attempt to provide
stability by uniting under a single banner hundreds of factions,
interest groups and small political parties thrown up by Mexico's
1910-17 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, and for many years, it was extraordinarily
successful. Yet its traditional strengths have become weaknesses:
the division between party and state was blurred and the PRI had no
clear ideology save that of power.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did each president impose his own policies on the PRI,
but he acted as the party's supreme arbiter, choosing its top
officials, while balancing and holding together an elaborate web of
interests to ensure the system's perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   So the first problem the PRI must confront is the vacuum created
by its loss of the presidency. But that is likely to overlap with
the policy battle.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and his two predecessors each pursued broadly liberal
economic policies which challenged corporatist traditions, and hurt
interest-groups such as labor and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's most obvious divide is between the ``technocrats'' who
came to dominate central government, and the traditionalist
``dinosaurs,'' who include many state governors. Labastida is in
fact an intermediate figure between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   But defeat tars with a broad brush. Labastida and his campaign
team, who included a few ``dinosaurs,'' as well as Zedillo and his
cabinet, are now equally discredited.
</P>
<P>
   And defeat has tarnished Zedillo's ``neo-liberal'' policies too.
These gave Mexico macroeconomic stability and new growth, but
increased the rich-poor gap and landed taxpayers with an expensive
bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   A more reflective analysis would note that the PRI was defeated
from its right, not its left, and that Fox might turn out to be as
``neo-liberal'' as Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI's mood is rebellious. ``Many people are angry with
Zedillo and have stopped obeying him,'' says Ernesto Ramirez, a
young civil servant who has spent 14 years as a PRI activist, and
calls himself a ``babysaur.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dinosaurs are now in a strong position, it is partly
because without the presidency the PRI's most powerful officials
will be its state governors and the bosses of the big pro-PRI trade
unions, such as those of the oil workers, telephone workers,
electricians and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, to get all the PRI's factions to
support Labastida's campaign, many old-timers were offered places
on the party's congressional lists.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lost, they did not: the PRI will no longer have an
absolute majority in the Senate, but it will still be the largest
single party in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That could make it hard for Fox to cut the deals he will need in
the legislature, if the PRI stays united. Will it? The first test
will come in internal elections, to be held probably in November. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750, OR CONTINUE TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a meeting with Zedillo on July 11, the PRI's state governors
agreed that Sauri should stay on as party chairman to prepare these
elections _ but with an advisory committee of the party's former
chairmen to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the PRI's executive resigned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   A dissident group of seven state governors, led by Roberto
Madrazo from the southeastern state of Tabasco, want a new election
for the PRI's 300-member national council, and not just for the
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo is tipped by some as the PRI's likely new leader. He was
Labastida's main challenger in last year's primary for the PRI's
presidential candidacy, which brought him national prominence and a
campaign network.
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Ramirez are already being invited to meetings
organized to push his bid for the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Madrazo at the helm worries many. Though he is
relatively young and talks of modernizing and democratizing the
party, his record speaks of a return to the old methods: his
election to the governorship in 1994 was so dogged by accusations
of overspending that Zedillo tried, but failed, to make him step
down.
</P>
<P>
   But in October Madrazo's own state elects a new governor. Should
the PRI lose, as it may, his credibility will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the PRI leadership will have to try to keep the
party together while working out a new set of policies, and seeking
new sources of funds. Without the patronage of central government,
and the largesse that flowed from it, many supporters may drift
away.
</P>
<P>
   Having relied in the past on the vote in rural areas, the party
has to make a special effort to attract young and middle-class
voters _ not something the dinosaurs are obviously well-placed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   More important than any new ideology, therefore, could be the
party's performance where it still has power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can't achieve good government at the municipal and state
level, it doesn't have a future,'' says Javier Trevino, a former
adviser to Labastida. ``That's what the old-timers don't want to
see.'' But that also gives Fox some leverage with which to gain
legislative allies. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Two floor assistants in Home Depot, a hardware
superstore, are chatting. ``Is there anyone left from our
orientation class other than us?'' one asks the other. ``Uh, let me
think. Nope, just you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   They shake their heads, wondering why they, alone in a group of
15 who joined only eight months earlier, are still there. Maybe
only suckers stick around in jobs like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   These are words and thoughts that strike terror across America.
Today nearly a quarter of working Americans clock in each day in
businesses where the average tenure is less than a year _ often far
less, as in the case of one 24-hour warehouse where the average
employee lasted just four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industries with 100 percent or more average annual turnover
include most of retailing, food services and call centers, along
with more specialized businesses that range from elderly-care
nursing to car sales. Together, they account for more than 30
million workers.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for all this disloyalty is America's tightest
labor market in a generation. Unemployment, at around 4 percent
nationally and less than 2 percent in many regions, is at a 30-year
low. Walk down any high street or cruise any shopping mall and it
is hard to find a store that is not begging for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than that. Behind the counters and
between the cubicles, the balance of power has shifted: workers
know that they are in demand and that they have more choices than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The ``free agent'' movement that is spurring white-collar
workers to shun corporate career paths is trickling down to
blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of job security and guarantees, they want opportunity
and merit pay. And if they do not get it, they do not hesitate to
quit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Americans' average tenure with their current
employer has remained relatively steady at around three years for
most of the past decade, but some industries are doing far worse
than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, part-time retail workers (the largest category of
employees in that industrial sector, which employs in total more
than 20 million people) had an average turnover rate last year of
124 percent, according to a survey by the National Retail
Federation; turnover of full-time workers was a still-shocking 74
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Food Marketing Institute estimates that turnover
of full-time grocery-store employees almost doubled between 1991
and 1999. The median tenure of supermarket employees is now 97
days, according to a recent survey by Blake Frank of the University
of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two favorite words in this industry have become `help
wanted,''' Michael Sansolo, a Food Marketing Institute vice
president, told a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's labor market is probably the toughest I've experienced
in my 30 years in this industry,'' says Bill Parker, who runs call
centers for Spherion, based in Florida. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, what many of these high-turnover jobs have
in common is that they are poorly paid, hard, boring, dead-end,
dangerous or otherwise unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, however: despite fast-rising salaries
and liberal use of such retention tools as stock options, employee
defections in the high-tech industry have also reached epidemic
proportion, with the average technology professional now staying on
the job for just 13 months, according to Roy Talman &AMP; Associates, a
Chicago headhunting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this employee churn is extraordinarily high. Most
analysts reckon that the cost of losing an employee, all told, is
between half and one-and-a-half times his annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Even fast-food joints, which typically think of staff as almost
as disposable as the cutlery, calculate the cost of replacing each
one at more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   For a software engineer, the total cost of a departure, from
lost production time to recruitment and training of the
replacement, can exceed $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the American Management Association put
turnover at the top of bosses' list of worries, with the majority
saying that their retention concerns were getting more serious each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in these industries is suffering equally. The best
have managed to change the way they run their operations to cut
turnover. Others are striving to find employees who are more likely
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a few years ago 7-Eleven, a convenience-store
chain, introduced an automated free phone number that allows job
applicants to fill out a form by telephone 24 hours a day. By
modifying the questions asked according to previous answers,
7-Eleven was able to screen out poor candidates more effectively
than if it used paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company hires nearly half of its new staff from such
telephone applicants, and retention rates have risen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the job-line's success was that it was easy
and convenient. For companies that are open fewer hours of the day
than a convenience chain, this can matter even more.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often find that allowing people to apply after hours
also brings in people who are already working elsewhere, a far more
desirable group than the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Storehouse, a men's clothing chain, goes so far as to issue
special employment-invitation cards to its employees and encourages
them to hand them out to anyone impressive whom they meet working
at another store. The strategy has been so successful that the
chain has kept its stores staffed without running help-wanted ads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the tight labor market is forcing firms to be
more flexible in the way they treat the employees they have.
</P>
<P>
   Loosening policies on working hours, for instance, can bring in
stay-at-home mothers who need to work around child care and
illnesses, a potentially valuable work force that is normally
excluded by strict shift regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Better training might seem like an odd response to a tight job
market _ after all, the employee is likely to leave, so why waste
the money? _ but it too can pay dividends, since one of the main
reasons why employees leave is the poor quality of their
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   And if the business sometimes has to be run shorthanded, the
best way to ensure that customers do not suffer is to make certain
the hands available are helpful ones.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for better advancement opportunities, merit-based
pay and language lessons: all help to build loyalty in a climate
where disloyalty is more commonly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious incentive _ more money _ is often the last to
be considered. Companies are under intense shareholder pressure to
keep down payroll costs, which have a more immediate and obvious
effect on corporate performance than morale.
</P>
<P>
   Although employees may leave for more money, non-monetary
factors are often more important, says Michael O'Malley, an
employment expert with William Mercer, a management consultancy.
Companies that try to ``buy happiness'' often end up with ``a deal
culture where everything is for sale and everything can be
bargained.''
</P>
<P>
   America's extraordinary lack of wage inflation _ $7 has been the
hourly rate for a supermarket worker for nearly a decade _ is
testament to the pervasiveness of this thinking. But with turnover
pressure still rising, clever management tricks can go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, stock options, free frappuccinos and the
chance to change the world are the rewards for loyalty. At Home
Depot it may eventually have to be more cash. &QL;

   As one might expect, what many of these high-turnover jobs have
in common is that they are poorly paid, hard, boring, dead-end,
dangerous or otherwise unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, however: despite fast-rising salaries
and liberal use of such retention tools as stock options, employee
defections in the high-tech industry have also reached epidemic
proportion, with the average technology professional now staying on
the job for just 13 months, according to Roy Talman &AMP; Associates, a
Chicago headhunting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this employee churn is extraordinarily high. Most
analysts reckon that the cost of losing an employee, all told, is
between half and one-and-a-half times his annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Even fast-food joints, which typically think of staff as almost
as disposable as the cutlery, calculate the cost of replacing each
one at more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   For a software engineer, the total cost of a departure, from
lost production time to recruitment and training of the
replacement, can exceed $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year by the American Management Association put
turnover at the top of bosses' list of worries, with the majority
saying that their retention concerns were getting more serious each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in these industries is suffering equally. The best
have managed to change the way they run their operations to cut
turnover. Others are striving to find employees who are more likely
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a few years ago 7-Eleven, a convenience-store
chain, introduced an automated free phone number that allows job
applicants to fill out a form by telephone 24 hours a day. By
modifying the questions asked according to previous answers,
7-Eleven was able to screen out poor candidates more effectively
than if it used paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company hires nearly half of its new staff from such
telephone applicants, and retention rates have risen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the job-line's success was that it was easy
and convenient. For companies that are open fewer hours of the day
than a convenience chain, this can matter even more.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often find that allowing people to apply after hours
also brings in people who are already working elsewhere, a far more
desirable group than the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Storehouse, a men's clothing chain, goes so far as to issue
special employment-invitation cards to its employees and encourages
them to hand them out to anyone impressive whom they meet working
at another store. The strategy has been so successful that the
chain has kept its stores staffed without running help-wanted ads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the tight labor market is forcing firms to be
more flexible in the way they treat the employees they have.
</P>
<P>
   Loosening policies on working hours, for instance, can bring in
stay-at-home mothers who need to work around child care and
illnesses, a potentially valuable work force that is normally
excluded by strict shift regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Better training might seem like an odd response to a tight job
market _ after all, the employee is likely to leave, so why waste
the money? _ but it too can pay dividends, since one of the main
reasons why employees leave is the poor quality of their
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   And if the business sometimes has to be run shorthanded, the
best way to ensure that customers do not suffer is to make certain
the hands available are helpful ones.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for better advancement opportunities, merit-based
pay and language lessons: all help to build loyalty in a climate
where disloyalty is more commonly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious incentive _ more money _ is often the last to
be considered. Companies are under intense shareholder pressure to
keep down payroll costs, which have a more immediate and obvious
effect on corporate performance than morale.
</P>
<P>
   Although employees may leave for more money, non-monetary
factors are often more important, says Michael O'Malley, an
employment expert with William Mercer, a management consultancy.
Companies that try to ``buy happiness'' often end up with ``a deal
culture where everything is for sale and everything can be
bargained.''
</P>
<P>
   America's extraordinary lack of wage inflation _ $7 has been the
hourly rate for a supermarket worker for nearly a decade _ is
testament to the pervasiveness of this thinking. But with turnover
pressure still rising, clever management tricks can go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, stock options, free frappuccinos and the
chance to change the world are the rewards for loyalty. At Home
Depot it may eventually have to be more cash. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two floor assistants in Home Depot, a hardware
superstore, are chatting. ``Is there anyone left from our
orientation class other than us?'' one asks the other. ``Uh, let me
think. Nope, just you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   They shake their heads, wondering why they, alone in a group of
15 who joined only eight months earlier, are still there. Maybe
only suckers stick around in jobs like theirs.
</P>
<P>
   These are words and thoughts that strike terror across America.
Today nearly a quarter of working Americans clock in each day in
businesses where the average tenure is less than a year _ often far
less, as in the case of one 24-hour warehouse where the average
employee lasted just four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Industries with 100 percent or more average annual turnover
include most of retailing, food services and call centers, along
with more specialized businesses that range from elderly-care
nursing to car sales. Together, they account for more than 30
million workers.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for all this disloyalty is America's tightest
labor market in a generation. Unemployment, at around 4 percent
nationally and less than 2 percent in many regions, is at a 30-year
low. Walk down any high street or cruise any shopping mall and it
is hard to find a store that is not begging for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than that. Behind the counters and
between the cubicles, the balance of power has shifted: workers
know that they are in demand and that they have more choices than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The ``free agent'' movement that is spurring white-collar
workers to shun corporate career paths is trickling down to
blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of job security and guarantees, they want opportunity
and merit pay. And if they do not get it, they do not hesitate to
quit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Americans' average tenure with their current
employer has remained relatively steady at around three years for
most of the past decade, but some industries are doing far worse
than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, part-time retail workers (the largest category of
employees in that industrial sector, which employs in total more
than 20 million people) had an average turnover rate last year of
124 percent, according to a survey by the National Retail
Federation; turnover of full-time workers was a still-shocking 74
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Food Marketing Institute estimates that turnover
of full-time grocery-store employees almost doubled between 1991
and 1999. The median tenure of supermarket employees is now 97
days, according to a recent survey by Blake Frank of the University
of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two favorite words in this industry have become `help
wanted,''' Michael Sansolo, a Food Marketing Institute vice
president, told a recent conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's labor market is probably the toughest I've experienced
in my 30 years in this industry,'' says Bill Parker, who runs call
centers for Spherion, based in Florida. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It sounds McCrazy. In an arguably unrivalled example
of corporate paranoia, McDonald's, a giant hamburger chain, has
forced a tiny health-care company based in Switzerland and calling
itself McWellness to change its name.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, of course, for McDonald's to defend itself
against a shoddy hamburger joint brightening up a greasy shopfront
with a pair of golden arches, or pinching the ``Mc'' prefix to
piggyback on its reputation for consistent standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even here the Oak Brook, Ill.-based multinational has been a
touch ruthless. It has sued a sausage stand in Denmark called
McAllan's, a coffee shop in California run by Elizabeth McCaughey,
and McMunchies, a sandwich shop in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is another thing, though, to send packs of lawyers after a
company that offers Internet-based medical services to corporate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Internet makes it easy for trademark harassers to
flush out offenders. But McWellness's rather silly name had nothing
to do with McDonald's anyway. Its genesis was McKinsey, a
management consultancy where its two founders once worked.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Staehelin, one of them, says she wanted a name, like
McKinsey, that promised global standards, although she admits that
reference to a McDonald's burger ``works just as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is why McDonald's would bother with this loss-making
small fry employing only 45 people. In a letter to the American
patent office's trademark trial and appeal board in January,
McDonald's lawyers complained that allowing the use of McWellness
or alternatives like McDoctor or McMedicine ``will create confusion
and will cause damage to its (McDonald's) hard-earned goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McWellness, which last month gave in and renamed itself
GetWellness at the cost of some $1.8 million, four times its annual
revenue, frighten patients with dark tales of cholesterol in Happy
Meals? Perhaps, though, McDonald's has more ambitious plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clues lurk in the vast array of non-food related trademarks
registered by the company _ McTravel and McSpaceStation among them.
It even claims to own the phrase ``Immunize for Healthy Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The company admits that its future plans ``are not limited to
food.'' Before it got nasty, McDonald's considered taking a stake
in McWellness.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, in their letter to the patent office, its lawyers
predict that McDonald's will ``likely expand the use of its `Mc'
formative marks to include the same services on which the
McWellness mark is intended to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciling burgers with health care might prove a stretch. But
McDonald's seems ready to give it a try. Where there's ``Mc,'' it
doubtless believes, there's brass. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It sounds McCrazy. In an arguably unrivalled example
of corporate paranoia, McDonald's, a giant hamburger chain, has
forced a tiny health-care company based in Switzerland and calling
itself McWellness to change its name.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, of course, for McDonald's to defend itself
against a shoddy hamburger joint brightening up a greasy shopfront
with a pair of golden arches, or pinching the ``Mc'' prefix to
piggyback on its reputation for consistent standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even here the Oak Brook, Ill.-based multinational has been a
touch ruthless. It has sued a sausage stand in Denmark called
McAllan's, a coffee shop in California run by Elizabeth McCaughey,
and McMunchies, a sandwich shop in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is another thing, though, to send packs of lawyers after a
company that offers Internet-based medical services to corporate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Internet makes it easy for trademark harassers to
flush out offenders. But McWellness's rather silly name had nothing
to do with McDonald's anyway. Its genesis was McKinsey, a
management consultancy where its two founders once worked.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Staehelin, one of them, says she wanted a name, like
McKinsey, that promised global standards, although she admits that
reference to a McDonald's burger ``works just as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is why McDonald's would bother with this loss-making
small fry employing only 45 people. In a letter to the American
patent office's trademark trial and appeal board in January,
McDonald's lawyers complained that allowing the use of McWellness
or alternatives like McDoctor or McMedicine ``will create confusion
and will cause damage to its (McDonald's) hard-earned goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McWellness, which last month gave in and renamed itself
GetWellness at the cost of some $1.8 million, four times its annual
revenue, frighten patients with dark tales of cholesterol in Happy
Meals? Perhaps, though, McDonald's has more ambitious plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clues lurk in the vast array of non-food related trademarks
registered by the company _ McTravel and McSpaceStation among them.
It even claims to own the phrase ``Immunize for Healthy Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The company admits that its future plans ``are not limited to
food.'' Before it got nasty, McDonald's considered taking a stake
in McWellness.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, in their letter to the patent office, its lawyers
predict that McDonald's will ``likely expand the use of its `Mc'
formative marks to include the same services on which the
McWellness mark is intended to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciling burgers with health care might prove a stretch. But
McDonald's seems ready to give it a try. Where there's ``Mc,'' it
doubtless believes, there's brass. &QL;

ITALY'S `GENETICALLY MUTATING' PRISON POPULATION

<P>
   MILAN _ ``The prison population has been genetically mutating,''
says Giancarlo Caselli, the man in charge of keeping Italy's
criminals behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   He is not referring to some scientific experiment under way in
such prisons as Milan's San Vittore or Rome's Regina Coeli, but to
changes in the social and criminal make-up within the country's 257
jails.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, nearly all inmates were Italian, and the range of
their crimes was wide. Today, out of 52,000 inside, 14,000 are
foreigners. One-third are there because of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Caselli is one of many who would like an amnesty; otherwise, he
fears, tensions may snap. It would be the 20th big release since
1947.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who support the current, rather shaky, coalition
government of the center-left broadly favor the idea of a new
amnesty; so does the Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul visited Regina Coeli on July 9, he appealed
_ to the cheers of inmates _ for ``a gesture of clemency.'' A week
before, in the hope of hastening their release, prisoners in
several jails had rioted. Disturbances have been reported in as
many as 52 Italian prisons in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The government has dithered, while making several proposals _
for new prisons, for more magistrates to make the wheels of justice
turn faster, for foreign criminals to be kicked out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But ministers are wary of suggesting another amnesty, because
the opinion polls suggest that six out of ten Italians are against
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, which is riding high, is not keen to help the
government out. Amnesties must be approved by a majority of
two-thirds in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost everyone agrees that something must be done. Italy
does not have a particularly large prison population, compared with
other countries, but its prisons are old and overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to hold up to 43,000 people _ 9,000 fewer than
now. San Vittore, which has 1,800 inmates, is designed for 800;
half its inmates are foreign.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, an amnesty would be only a stopgap. Judicial
sloth, unless special steps are taken, will continue to be a major
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Italy's inmates are on remand, waiting to be tried. In
Naples alone, some 578,000 cases are pending. Of the 9 million or
so new cases that crop up every year, many are minor and should not
carry a jail sentence. Judges lack proper staff and computers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process is so lengthy that more genuine villains now
get off by statute of limitation; almost all sentences of less than
two years are automatically suspended. In that sense, an informal
amnesty is taking place already. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Most black people don't think alike. Most black
people just vote alike,'' says J.C. Watts, a black Republican
congressman from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   That disjunction between the variety of black views and the
near-unanimity of support for Democrats sent George W. Bush, the
Republicans' presumptive presidential nominee, to Baltimore this
week, to address the annual meeting of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the largest black
political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting heroes such as Jackie Robinson, the first black
professional baseball player, and W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the
NAACP's founders, he tried to lay the groundwork for a
reconciliation between his party and blacks by conceding that
racism still exists in America (which some Republicans have denied)
and by a nostra culpa: ``The party of Lincoln hasn't always carried
the mantle of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to school reform in Texas, which has raised the
educational standards of minority students, and argued that
``compassionate conservatism'' offered a better alternative to poor
blacks than traditional big-government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The applause was diplomatic and the immediate response polite,
if skeptical. The Rev. Sidney Daniels, a civil-rights leader,
argued that ``in spite of all the promises he seems to be making,
he's still got the idea that private concerns can take over the
work of the government.'' But he gave Bush credit for showing up at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans consistently get a mere 10 percent of the black
vote, plus or minus 5 percent, says David Bositis, a senior
political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a black think-tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole's showing among black voters in 1996, an anemic 13
percent, was still the best the GOP has managed since Dwight
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just bad news for Governor Bush; it is bad news for
America's blacks. Although their long identification with the
Democratic Party has allowed some black leaders to emerge, it has
been, for the most part, a Faustian bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates can make token promises to blacks which
can then be conveniently set aside as they dash to the middle for
swing votes, says the Rev Floyd Flake, a former Democratic
congressman from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans, reading the writing on the polls, never
bother to make any meaningful promises in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Republicans have much to recommend them to blacks,
who often describe themselves as more conservative than whites on a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 poll conducted by the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, blacks were twice as likely as whites to cite
crime, violence and drugs as the most important problems facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are significantly more likely than whites to support
school vouchers. Most blacks oppose abortion, says Watts (who would
say that). Three in four support school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans might even trawl for black votes with pocketbook
issues. Since 1970, around 2 million black families have moved into
the middle class (i.e., earning more than $50,000 in 1997 dollars).
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see why they should be any more enthusiastic about
Democratic poverty programs than their white suburban neighbors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Black Chamber of Commerce supports the repeal of the
inheritance tax. Watts even makes the slightly macabre suggestion
that blacks should favor private individual retirement accounts,
rather than the current system of state-guaranteed Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They die younger than whites, he reasons. Unclaimed Social
Security benefits revert to the government; but private retirement
savings can be left to the family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So will Bush's appeal change minds? Not if the later reaction at
the Baltimore conference is any guide. An hour after he (and the
television crews) had left, Maxine Waters, a Democratic
congresswoman from Los Angeles, took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we give people an opportunity to talk to us,'' she cried,
`` they should do more than quote our black heroes. When we give
you our platform, come prepared to talk business with us. We're
talking about police abuse, driving while black.'' The hall erupted
in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Wendell Anthony, the president of the Detroit branch of
the NAACP (the largest in the country) was even ruder about Bush:
``An empty speech, an abdication of responsibility, he failed
miserably to address our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may indeed be the party of Abraham Lincoln, but
the Democrats became the party of Franklin Roosevelt. The New Deal
had much to offer poor blacks. Blacks and Republicans parted ways
more permanently three decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ``Southern strategy'' of the 1960s successfully
drew Southern whites into the party by opposing civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, likes to claim that
every voter has a formative political experience: for many black
voters, it was the civil-rights era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all there is a basic lack of trust in the Republican
Party. ``If you don't trust,'' argues Bositis, ``issues really are
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders compound their problems, he adds, with
``fool's errands'': defending the Confederate flag, visiting Bob
Jones University, holding up the appointments of black judges and
ambassadors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   However, at the local level, Republican hopes for some sort of
modest realignment look more realistic. As the Rev. Buster Soaries,
an adviser to (Republican) Governor Christine Todd Whitman in New
Jersey, puts it, ``There has been a lot of black political power
without a corresponding gain in welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican governors have done well with black voters. John
Engler earned 27 percent of the black vote in Michigan in 1998, the
same portion as Bush in Texas; Mrs. Whitman did similarly well in
New Jersey. Republican mayors, such as Bret Schundler in Jersey
City, have done even better.
</P>
<P>
   These state and local Republicans are more pragmatic than their
congressional colleagues. They are closer to the people and have
overcome black mistrust by letting their policies do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   They are also predominantly from the Northeast and Midwest,
where there is a kinder, gentler brand of Republicanism. ``They're
a different Republican Party,'' says Bositis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Bush to pick up 27 percent of the national black
vote in 2000. No candidate can reclaim goodwill lost over half a
century. But future elections might be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to get elected to do those things,'' says Kristol,
who reckons that a compassionate George W. Bush, elected in 2000,
could double his vote among blacks in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution,
tells a story (probably apocryphal) about Brigham Young. The Mormon
visionary reached Utah with his followers and promptly decreed that
half of them would be Democrats and half Republicans: that way,
their votes would never be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   America would be a better place with more black Republicans.
That is not a bad place to start. &QL;

&HT;     RESEARCHERS PINPOINT PROTEIN LINKED TO CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Scientists say they have discovered how two
important genes work together in a healthy cell and why cancer can
form when these genes are defective.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center say
they have identified a protein that is activated by a gene known as
ATM, and now understand how ATM communicates with BRCA1, a gene
implicated in some inherited forms of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Wen-Hwa Lee and his colleagues at the Institute of
Biotechnology was published Thursday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   BRCA1, the so-called breast cancer gene, is a tumor suppressor
that activates when there is damage to DNA, the genetic blueprint
that resides in the nucleus of the cell. Estimates are that defects
in this gene account for 2 percent to 5 percent of breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ATM is considered a master switch that ``talks'' to other genes
in a cell, including the BRCA1 gene, and alerts them when there is
damage to DNA. These genes in turn carry out repairs. Without
repairs, the damaged cells can become cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Defects in the ATM gene are known to cause a syndrome called
ataxia telangiectasia, or A-T, which is characterized by stunted
growth, immune disorders, neurological deficits and cancers like
leukemia and lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   A-T occurs once in every 40,000 births, when a child inherits
two copies of a defective ATM gene, one from each parent. These
children rarely survive into their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 percent of the population has one defective copy
of ATM, Lee said, which leaves these individuals with impaired
responses to DNA damage.
</P>
<P>
   In normal cells, the researchers found, ATM activates a protein
called CtIP, which in turn causes the BRCA1 gene to produce another
protein, GADD 45, which is essential in cell repair.
</P>
<P>
   By learning how the ATM gene works, Lee said, scientists are
identifying potential targets for cancer drugs and other therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are still very, very far away,'' Lee said. ``We need
much more study.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, the focus should be on prevention.
People who know they have ATM and BRCA1 mutations should limit
their exposure to DNA-damaging elements like radiation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are ATM deficient, it is best not to go enjoy too much
sunshine or take too many X-rays,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's wife, Eva Y.P. Lee, also participated in the study.

   The Black Chamber of Commerce supports the repeal of the
inheritance tax. Watts even makes the slightly macabre suggestion
that blacks should favor private individual retirement accounts,
rather than the current system of state-guaranteed Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They die younger than whites, he reasons. Unclaimed Social
Security benefits revert to the government; but private retirement
savings can be left to the family. &QL;

<P>
   So will Bush's appeal change minds? Not if the later reaction at
the Baltimore conference is any guide. An hour after he (and the
television crews) had left, Maxine Waters, a Democratic
congresswoman from Los Angeles, took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we give people an opportunity to talk to us,'' she cried,
`` they should do more than quote our black heroes. When we give
you our platform, come prepared to talk business with us. We're
talking about police abuse, driving while black.'' The hall erupted
in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Wendell Anthony, the president of the Detroit branch of
the NAACP (the largest in the country) was even ruder about Bush:
``An empty speech, an abdication of responsibility, he failed
miserably to address our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may indeed be the party of Abraham Lincoln, but
the Democrats became the party of Franklin Roosevelt. The New Deal
had much to offer poor blacks. Blacks and Republicans parted ways
more permanently three decades later.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ``Southern strategy'' of the 1960s successfully
drew Southern whites into the party by opposing civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, likes to claim that
every voter has a formative political experience: for many black
voters, it was the civil-rights era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all there is a basic lack of trust in the Republican
Party. ``If you don't trust,'' argues Bositis, ``issues really are
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders compound their problems, he adds, with
``fool's errands'': defending the Confederate flag, visiting Bob
Jones University, holding up the appointments of black judges and
ambassadors. &QL;

   However, at the local level, Republican hopes for some sort of
modest realignment look more realistic. As the Rev. Buster Soaries,
an adviser to (Republican) Governor Christine Todd Whitman in New
Jersey, puts it, ``There has been a lot of black political power
without a corresponding gain in welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican governors have done well with black voters. John
Engler earned 27 percent of the black vote in Michigan in 1998, the
same portion as Bush in Texas; Mrs. Whitman did similarly well in
New Jersey. Republican mayors, such as Bret Schundler in Jersey
City, have done even better.
</P>
<P>
   These state and local Republicans are more pragmatic than their
congressional colleagues. They are closer to the people and have
overcome black mistrust by letting their policies do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   They are also predominantly from the Northeast and Midwest,
where there is a kinder, gentler brand of Republicanism. ``They're
a different Republican Party,'' says Bositis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,175) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Bush to pick up 27 percent of the national black
vote in 2000. No candidate can reclaim goodwill lost over half a
century. But future elections might be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to get elected to do those things,'' says Kristol,
who reckons that a compassionate George W. Bush, elected in 2000,
could double his vote among blacks in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings Institution,
tells a story (probably apocryphal) about Brigham Young. The Mormon
visionary reached Utah with his followers and promptly decreed that
half of them would be Democrats and half Republicans: that way,
their votes would never be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   America would be a better place with more black Republicans.
That is not a bad place to start. &QL;

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
under U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993. But
America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at the tail
end of his presidency. This, above all else, has dictated the
timing of the crucial summit between Clinton, Arafat and Israel's
current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp David, giving it sudden
now-or-never urgency. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It is hard to absorb the full reality. So far, the
global AIDS epidemic is thought to have killed 19 million people.
That is almost twice as many as died in the First World War. It has
infected another 34 million. Within the next few years, AIDS will
have killed nearly as many as the Second World War _ mostly on the
African continent. And the epidemic shows no signs of abating. AIDS
in poor countries will not go away so long as their leaders do not
take a lead in fighting against it. And Africa's rulers, with one
or two shining exceptions, have not yet done so. Some have simply
ignored the problem, and available remedies _ to deadly effect. &QL;

perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost none of the
malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark. He still knows
how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be settled
peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he hopes the
West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only person who can
resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up. This time, the
West must do better. &QL;

percent of the black vote, plus or minus 5 percent, according to a
black think-tank in Washington. This is not just bad news for

project was a ``high-risk'' one. In fact, barely a feather flew.
The missile test of July 7 suffered a failure so fundamental that
it did not even figure among the various ``high-risk'' scenarios
the Pentagon had worried about. It was, in short, a bit like
hitting a tethered chicken. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Two floor assistants in Home Depot, a hardware

orientation class other than us?'' one asks the other. ``Uh, let me
think. Nope, just you and me.'' They shake their heads, wondering
why they, alone in a group of 15 who joined only eight months
earlier, are still there. Maybe only suckers stick around in jobs
like theirs. These are words and thoughts that strike terror across
America. Today nearly a quarter of working Americans clock in each
day in businesses where the average tenure is less than a year _
often far less. The ``free agent'' movement that is spurring
white-collar workers to shun corporate career paths is trickling
down to blue-collar workers. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Deadline after deadline has slipped by since Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
under U.S. President Bill Clinton's benevolent eye, signed their
declaration of peace on the White House lawn in September 1993. But
America's electoral calendar is compelling. Clinton is at the tail
end of his presidency. This, above all else, has dictated the
timing of the crucial summit between Clinton, Arafat and Israel's
current prime minister, Ehud Barak, at Camp David, giving it sudden
now-or-never urgency. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ It is hard to absorb the full reality. So far, the
global AIDS epidemic is thought to have killed 19 million people.
That is almost twice as many as died in the First World War. It has
infected another 34 million. Within the next few years, AIDS will
have killed nearly as many as the Second World War _ mostly on the
African continent. And the epidemic shows no signs of abating. AIDS
in poor countries will not go away so long as their leaders do not
take a lead in fighting against it. And Africa's rulers, with one
or two shining exceptions, have not yet done so. Some have simply
ignored the problem, and available remedies _ to deadly effect. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Slobodan Milosevic, whose downfall as Yugoslav
president seemed imminent just last year when his troops were
driven out of Kosovo by NATO forces, is in fact tightening and
perpetuating his grip on power. Worse, he has lost none of the
malign ingenuity that has always been his hallmark. He still knows
how to exacerbate crises that might otherwise be settled
peacefully. And despite being indicted for war crimes, he hopes the
West will turn to him, as it has before, as the only person who can
resolve a conflict that he has himself stirred up. This time, the
West must do better. &QL;

when the real Al Gore will please stand up. The answer may be: now.
Over the past week, a new, retooled model candidate has been
road-tested. With this version, Gore may at last have settled on
something he can take to the voters in November. It may even work. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ One way to test the buoyancy of Nasdaq is to observe
the blouses and trousers of America. With their investment accounts
swelling, Americans have been laying out more money than ever for
tucks, lifts, implants, peels, injections and assorted
``augmentations.'' According to the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons (ASPS), the number of cosmetic surgical procedures grew
almost as quickly as the Dow _ from 413,000 in 1992 to over 1
million in 1998. &QL;

black think-tank in Washington. This is not just bad news for
Governor George W. Bush; it is bad news for America's blacks.

space, the Pentagon had given careful warnings that the whole
project was a ``high-risk'' one. In fact, barely a feather flew.
The missile test of July 7 suffered a failure so fundamental that
it did not even figure among the various ``high-risk'' scenarios
the Pentagon had worried about. It was, in short, a bit like
hitting a tethered chicken. &QL;

methods to sustain it in opposition. Its ability _ or failure _ to

 &HT;    NEW AOL MEXICO FEELS AUTHENTIC IN TONE AND CONTENT
 &HT;    Moving in (l) lifestyle and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online Inc.'s new Spanish-language service
is a virtual passport to an authentic online Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The largest U.S. Internet service provider launched AOL Mexico
this week in hopes of winning a large share of the country's
fast-growing market for online services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because AOL users in this country will have access
to the same Spanish-language content at no additional cost, ``it
will provide direct links between U.S. Hispanics and Mexicans,''
said Eduardo Escalante, president of AOL Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Escalante predicted the new service would be a big hit in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a service that is so easy to use and so convenient, we
think it is going to be very successful in this market, because
most people are going to be new users,'' Escalante said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the AOL Mexico's first users in Mexico City, Fernando
Moreno, 40, was impressed with the service's speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is because the service is new, but I logged
on very quickly,'' Moreno said in a phone interview in Spanish. It
is typical to wait for several minutes to log on with other
Internet providers, Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it,'' Moreno said. ``It is a very practical service.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL hired Mexican natives to design the new service, choose its
content and ensure its appeal to new subscribers, Escalante said.
</P>
<P>
   The screens in AOL Mexico are in generally the same style as the
American version, but the designers were obviously familiar with
Mexican taste.
</P>
<P>
   There are no pictures of Chihuahuas or other American-made
stereotypes. Where American users click on a dollar sign to link to
a financial page, Mexicans click on a piggy bank. Other links refer
to Mexican revolutionary heroes. Well-known Mexican lotto pictures
of a rooster, a heart and a ladder link to chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   As of content, there are areas for the latest political news on
Vicente Fox's election as the next Mexican president, soccer news
for sports fans, and chat rooms for the ``novelas,'' Mexico's
popular soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took AOL 5.0 and adapted if for Mexico,'' Escalante said.
``It looks Mexican and feels Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many basic terms remain the same. Words like e-mail, chat
room, CD and home page are not translated. They are part of the
Spanish Internet language.
</P>
<P>
   The new service is available only in Mexico City, although
Escalante said it will soon expand to other cities. Many
cybercafes, a popular way to access the Internet in the capital,
have not yet installed the AOL software on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage more users, AOL Mexico is also teaming up with
Compaq Computers to bundle a PC and Internet service for about $55
a month.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is also offering Mexican users a three-month trial period,
compared to the one month offered in the United States, before they
begin paying a monthly fee equivalent to $22.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now it can be hard to find Mexican users on line. A
recent visit to AOL Mexico _ made by clicking on the Mexican flag
on the main page of the American service _ turned up mostly U.S.
residents.
</P>
<P>
   AOL customer Mary Marrero, a Puerto Rican living in Florida,
found the new site and logged on to find out what Mexicans were up
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans are very humble people. When we chat I spend most of
the time explaining the Spanish terms used in Puerto Rico,''
Marrero said in a chat room conversation.

HEATWAVE CONTINUES FROM ROMANIA TO SOUTHERN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ADAPARAZI, Turkey _ For Sevgi Pinarci and her family, the
scorching temperatures that swept Turkey and southeastern Europe
over the past 10 days amount to heaping insult on top of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since a devastating earthquake last August destroyed their home,
Pinarci, her husband and their two children have been living in a
tiny two-room makeshift shanty in a rubble-filled vacant lot. There
is no electricity, no running water and no relief from temperatures
inside the shack that have reached more than 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for the children to sleep because even at
midnight it's like the hot sun at noon,'' said Pinarci, 38, as her
husband, Omer, 39, and two sons, Kaan, 13, and Bahadir, 9, looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the region eased somewhat Friday, but the
effects of the prolonged heat wave were still being felt from
Romania to southern Turkey. Crops, already suffering from a summer
drought, were damaged further. Water levels in reservoirs dipped,
threatening irrigation and hydroelectric plants. And firefighters
continued to battle wild fires on both sides of the Aegean Sea in
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the heat, with temperatures topping 100
degrees, the authorities in Romania and Bulgaria ordered trains to
stop running because they feared that tracks would buckle from the
heat. The only nuclear plant in Romania was temporarily shut down
after the temperature inside reached 158 degrees and set off
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Croatia were declared natural disaster areas as the
effects of the drought on crops was magnified by soaring
temperatures. Officials predicted crop production would be 40
percent to 70 percent lower than last year as a result of the
weather. Crops were also damaged in other countries, including
Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, high temperatures and strong winds helped to ignite
and spread more than 100 wildfires and led Prime Minister Costas
Simitis to order emergency services on maximum alert. ``Every
available force has been mobilized, and we hope we can bring the
situation under control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire temporarily threatened the ancient town of Corinth, 50
miles southwest of Athens, and other blazes cast a brownish pall
over the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching heat has claimed at least 50 lives across
southeastern Europe and more than 20 in Turkey and sent hundreds of
people to hospitals. In Istanbul, the heat topped 110 degrees and
broke a 60-year-old record. In other parts of the country,
temperatures reached 130 degrees and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey ordered government
offices closed Thursday and Friday to lessen the danger to workers
and ease the drain on the country's electricity resources. In this
politically contentious country, even the prime minister's largess
could not escape criticism. Mehmet Yildirim, chairman of the
Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, told a local newspaper, ``If this
government was in Saudi Arabia it would declare all 365 days of the
year a vacation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Highways were so softened by the heat in parched central Turkey
that the Ministry of Public Works banned truck traffic during
daylight hours for two days because the vehicles were digging deep
gouges into the asphalt. Istanbul police were issued sunblock
lotion and sandals and permitted to take showers during short
breaks at the hottest times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But few showers were available for the tens of thousands of
Turks who have been living in prefabricated houses, tent cities and
shanty towns since the earthquake Aug. 17 that killed at least
17,000 people and left as many as 500,000 homeless. While the
government quickly rebuilt main highways, progress has been slow in
returning people to damaged homes or building new housing in
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman said there are 35 official tent cities,
housing about 30,000 people, throughout the region damaged by the
earthquake. But the officials figures do not count all of the
people who are still homeless.

<P>
   Here in Adaparazi, a city of about 180,000 some 100 miles
southeast of Istanbul, the Pinarcis are among seven or eight
families who have built ramshackle homes on a vacant lot not far
from their damaged homes. They bring in fresh water by bottle, cook
with propane tanks and wash their clothes in plastic tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Even as temperatures moderated and slipped below triple digits
Friday, the darkened bedroom of their two-room shanty was stifling,
and a hot wind blew a layer of dust across everything in the open
kitchen area. Sitting at a plastic table beneath an umbrella
outside the shack, Omer Pinarci complained that they had been
unable to join hundreds of other families in government-provided
prefabricated houses because local authorities said their house was
not damaged enough. But he said the house is unsafe and he refused
to allow his wife and children to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Winter was difficult, he said, but the last 10 days of heat were
even worse. ``The heat has been very bad, very bad,'' he said
mournfully.

   If you thought Net stocks were tricky, try genomics.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing about the emerging genomics industry is that
billions of dollars in research money will be thrown at it. Some
will pay off. A lot won't. And it may take years or decades for
some research to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   That's why analysts and investors now seem most apt to recommend
pick-and-shovel companies that sell the tools to the hoards of drug
companies joining the genomic gold rush. Thar's gold in them thar
hills! You may not find any, but you certainly won't get anywhere
without the tools.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking has had these stocks rallying in recent weeks,
though Thursday morning saw a pullback that knocked the big biotech
indices down by about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A decent track record won't hurt, either. ``I go for
revenue-driven companies, not companies that are in early stages,''
says Paul Knight, analyst with Thomas Weisel, who recommends
PerkinElmer, BioSource International and Varian Medical Systems,
which all make products for the biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have established products and distribution networks,'' he
explains. Weisel, which rates all three stocks strong buys, advised
PerkinElmer in a recent transaction but doesn't do work for the
others.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Knight, ``if you want to play with fire, there's lots
of fire to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   And lots of momentum, too. The Nasdaq Biotech Index tripled over
a year to early March, then lost 50 percent of its value over two
months. Now the measure has nearly doubled off its lows, leaving it
around 1300 Thursday, just 20 percent below its all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have benefited from the pick-and-shovel logic
include Celera Genomics, Incyte Genomics, Millennium
Pharmaceutical, Human Genome Sciences and Qiagen, all of whose
shares have posted hefty gains over past year on hopes for their
gene-research prowess. All sell research to big pharma companies,
although Human Genome is also developing gene-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   While Celera has been in the news most lately for compiling the
first draft of the human genetic blueprint, all of these companies
have been compiling data for years, mainly for big pharmaceutical
and biotech companies. All are looking to find ways to manipulate
the 100,000 or so genes in the human genetic makeup to find
profitable new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And with cash coming from such alliances, tool-kit companies can
be valued on traditional investment measures, such as net present
value and earnings multiples, even though some, like Incyte and
Human Genome, are still posting losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person to get all the information is in a great
position,'' says Matthew Murray, a fund manager with Alliance
Capital's new biotechnology fund. The fund is one of several that
have formed in recent months to invest in genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Will the genomic leaders of today be the defunct Commodore and
Atari computer makers of tomorrow? Not in all cases, some investors
say. That's because the barriers to entry in the genomics field are
higher than for computers. Furthermore, patents on genetic findings
could ensure a steady stream of royalties in coming years from
drugs on the market. ``The founder effect is much more pronounced
for these companies'' than computer makers, says Murray.
</P>
<P>
   How many new drugs will be created from genetic findings is an
open question. Already there have been some 90 drugs from the
biotechnology industry approved, mainly new drugs to replace or
interact with proteins in the body, as well as vaccines and
antibodies that target certain illnesses. But new gene maps are
opening up hundreds of new targets for research.
</P>
<P>
   But with unproved technologies and no established record of
generating money, the old rules for investing apply, such as the
portfolio approach. It's a rule of thumb among biotech investors
that for every 10 stocks, one or two may succeed, two or three will
be marginally successful and the rest will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be working on the genome for the next 100
years,'' says Steve Newby, fund manager with GenomicsFund.com, a
Maryland fund with $14 million invested in 21 genomics stocks.
``There's going to be some wipeouts and some grand slam home
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The GenomicsFund, which was started in March, breaks out stock
purchases into four main areas: pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics,
analysis technologies and delivery technologies. The biggest sector
in the fund _ and probably the highest risk _ is pharmacogenomics,
which is finding new drugs based on genetics. Top names in this
sector include Human Genome Sciences (which not only has a gene
database but is developing drugs based on it), Millennium, Protein
Design Labs and Medarex.
</P>
<P>
   Newby says, ``We stick with the leaders'' in the sector, and the
strategy seems to be paying off for now. With surging investor
interest in genomic plays, the firm topped both Morningstar and
Lipper mutual fund performance rankings in the second quarter,
GenomicsFund says.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sticks with the leaders, of course. Some analysts
see the future leaders in newer companies like Orchid Biosciences
and Sequenom, the leaders of some 20 companies researching
variations in genes called SNPs, or ``snips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Billions of dollars will be tossed toward this area in the
next few years, and the pie is big enough to support many
players,'' says Tim Bepler, fund manager with Orbitex Health &AMP;
Biotechnology fund, a $300 million biotech fund with about 35% of
its assets in genomic stocks. ``We think a basket approach makes
the most sense.''

&HT;     NEW SYSTEM EASES ACCESS TO MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new law took affect Friday that allows
residents with a doctor's note and $25 to obtain a health
identification card that shows they are legitimate marijuana
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and those who advocate marijuana for medicinal
uses say people who need the substance also need to be free of
police scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a positive step to be recognized by a city
government,'' said Jane Weirick, director of the San Francisco
Patients Resource Center, who uses marijuana to help her deal with
a degenerative disc disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should do anything we can that makes it easier for patients
to be recognized as legitimate. This is a way we can say, `Hey,
this is real. This is valid.' And it's time for law enforcement to
start seeing that this is valid.''
</P>
<P>
   The governing San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by chief
sponsor Mark Leno, approved the ID card program in January,
extending it to patients who have a doctor's OK as well as their
primary caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary program is another step in instituting Proposition
215, approved by California voters in 1996. The law allows people
suffering from such illnesses as AIDS, cancer and glaucoma to
possess marijuana legally.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates have also lauded San Francisco's identity program for
its confidentiality. The cards will show the person's photo, but
not his or her name or address. The San Francisco Department of
Public Health is not keeping a list of names or filing application
documents, but rather will keep only a serial number and a
corresponding expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very secure for the patients,'' Weirick said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of other California jurisdictions already have similar
programs in place, among them Oakland, Arcata and Mendocino County.

 &HT;    LIFE FOR JERUSALEM ARABS AND JEWS ALREADY DIVIDED
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On the crowded stone streets of Jerusalem's Old
City, Jews and Arabs live in the shadows of their holy sites.
Distrust runs high and the thought of sharing power among the two
peoples seems impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need a lot of guns and a lot of military,'' says
Gavriel Hubara, a Torah scribe who lives in the Jewish Quarter.
``They will try to push us out.''
</P>
<P>
   But, walk through the gates in the Old City walls and drive 15
minutes north. You're still in Jerusalem and it's still controlled
by Israel, but Jews and Arabs casually move in separate realms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should give all their territories to them,'' says Dima
Ribo, an 18-year-old Jewish student in the neighborhood of Pisgat
Ze'ev. He does not have any contact with the Arab neighborhood a
few hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators at the Camp David peace talks this weekend will
reportedly discuss sharing or dividing the city among Palestinians
and Israelis. It may be the most difficult of all the issues on
their agenda. Palestinians want a piece of a city that Israelis say
is entirely theirs, forever _ their ``eternal, undivided,
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   But life in Jerusalem is already divided in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1998, according to the Jerusalem Institute for Israel
Studies, the city was populated by 433,600 Jews and 200,100 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a mosaic of segregated neighborhoods. Their
children attend separate schools with different curriculum and
weekends. They speak different languages, celebrate different
holidays and rarely interact socially.
</P>
<P>
   Jews rarely go to most Arab areas. Arab areas get short shrift _
even by Israeli officials' estimates _ to city services like road
work and trash pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   When a crime occurs, Palestinians sometimes turn for help to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's West Bank security services,
which already operate secretly in some areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the primarily Arab Old City, the religious symbols and exotic
bazaars draw Israeli worshippers and shoppers by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But, in other areas, troops in flak jackets are about the only
regular Israeli visitors. They shout orders at the locals from
bullhorns on their jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Camp David summit say the variation within the
city could lead to practical solutions for peace. The key is to
separate the emotional, symbolic issues from practical ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often, Jerusalem is presented in mystical terms that have
very little to do with reality,'' Daniel Seidemann, a peace
activist and expert on Jerusalem, says. ``Some of the political
arrangements that could be put into place do not require creating a
new reality but just recognizing the existing one.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls Israel's rule ``virtual sovereignty,'' because in many
Arab areas Israeli officials have little daily involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli peace activists say separate and joint political
arrangements could be set up in different areas of the city. They
would be placed depending on how important the areas are to Jews,
what the local Arabs want and how easy they are to separate.
</P>
<P>
   That angers Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who says the Camp David
talks should not allow any ``joint administration, joint
sovereignty or joint anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmert, who also opposed the historic Camp David agreement
between Israel and Egypt 22 years ago, says division in Jerusalem
would lead to confusion and fighting among adjacent authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, seek to capitalize on the
divisions in daily life as justifications for getting Israel out of
the Arab neighborhoods, roughly in eastern parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those declarations by your leaders about Israeli
sovereignty in East Jerusalem are nonsense,'' Palestinian Cabinet
Minister Ziad Abu Zayyad told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth
Ahronoth.
</P>
<P>
   The city was split in 1948. When the British rule ended, Israel
was formed and Arab armies attacked to try to quash the birth of
the Jewish state. Israel held on to the western side. For almost 30
years, Jews lost access to their holy sites in the Old City. Then,
Israel captured the Old City and the east from Jordan in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   But, most countries keep their embassies outside the city and do
not recognize Israel's claim to the captured areas.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a final peace agreement, the hardest problem is the
Old City, with about 2,900 Jews and more than 22,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Western Wall, sacred to Jews, forms a retaining
foundation for a campus that was once the site of ancient temples
central to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the campus above the wall is home to the Dome of the Rock
and Al-Aqsa mosques, sacred to Muslims who believe it is land where
the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, though, power is already shared. Israel rules but
gives day-to-day control over the mosques to Palestinians. Jews can
pray at the wall, but access for Israelis to the campus above is
tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the city, Arab and Jewish neighborhoods spread
out. Some are separated by rocky valleys, while others abut.
</P>
<P>
   If the lines were ever clear, they became especially confused
after 1967. An Israeli building program put 10 neighborhoods and
about 150,000 Jews on the east side to divide the Arab population
there.
</P>
<P>
   They live apart from their Arab neighbors in culture, politics
and most everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs in Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens _ though at
times Israel has offered citizenship. They cannot vote in Israeli
national elections but were allowed to vote in Palestinian
Authority elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Zakarya Abu Sirrieh, 58, lives in one of three Arab homes at the
dead end of a street in Jewish Pisgat Ze'ev. He was here before the
Jewish community was built in the late 1980s and says his lingering
presence is a ``fork in their throat.''
</P>
<P>
   He only knows the names of two of his Jewish neighbors and
occasionally visits with one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our values are different from theirs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted to add on to his house, he borrowed money not
from an Israeli bank but from the Orient House, the office in
Jerusalem that acts as a branch of the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Israeli leaders might exaggerate their control over the
city, Palestinian leaders may overstate the desire of Jerusalem
Arabs to join the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jerusalem Palestinians say they enjoy Israeli health
insurance and fear paying higher taxes to Arafat's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Most feel mistreated by the Israelis, but wary of the incipient
and somewhat chaotic Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution in the Old City will be some kind of U.N.
control because neither side will give up their religious places,''
says Arab Mohammed Hamad, 42, who owns a grocery in the Old City's
Jewish Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a Jewish boy in a skullcap entered to buy chocolate
milk and paused to write the amount on a tab his family keeps
there. Arab women in headscarves browsed the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very, complicated,'' the grocer says. ``If you know
how to relate to people, you can make it.''

   DIVISIONS AMONG IRISH PROTESTANTS REVEAL CRACKS IN PEACE PROCESS

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland - On grassy patch along the Corcrain
Road in a ramshackle Protestant neighborhood here, the flames were
still burning Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   These were the remnants of Tuesday night's immense bonfire _
which was topped with an orange, green and white Irish flag and an
effigy of a Northern Irish policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story blaze of scrap lumber, pallets and old furniture
_ there were even kitchen cabinets complete with metal sinks _
added a hellish light to the night's tumultuous edition of the
riots that have plagued this year's marching season.
</P>
<P>
   To repel an assault of the brick, beer-bottle and
gasoline-bomb-wielding mob _ composed in part of neighborhood
children _ police employed water cannons, batons and fired rubber
bul confirmed that the province is a long way from resolving the
blood feud that has claimed 3,600 lives over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, which climaxed on July 12 _ known universally
as The Twelfth _Protestants hold about 2,700 parades across
Northern Ireland to celebrate King William of Orange's 310-year-old
victory of over his rival Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
   The 1690 victory created the division in Ireland between the
north, which is still a British province, and the South, which
became the Republic of Ireland in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The catalogue of violence for this year's season, which began
July 1 and ended Thursday, provides chilling proof of how far the
province is from attaining a peace that U.S. President Bill Clinton
desperately wants to claim as part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the period, there were 329 attacks on security forces,
injuring 81 police officers and six soldiers, police said. There
were 305 incidents involving gasoline bombs. It could have been
worse: Police recovered 1,000 bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five homes, 75 commercial or public premises and 404 cars
were damaged, and 105 vehicles were hijacked. Security forces fired
19 plastic bullets, 217 people were arrested and 87 have been
charged.
</P>
<P>
   While there were reports of a few stabbings, one man died after
being shot in the back of his head near a bonfire Tuesday night in
the port city of Larne. Local newspapers have reported that he may
have been killed for singing a song that may have offended some
Protestant militants.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders have been shocked by what they consider an
appropriation by hooligans of their respectable celebration. Some
fear that the organization's leaders have done too little to stop
the lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see people blocking traffic with pints of beer in their
hands, that was not the organization I joined,'' said William
Brown, a longtime Orange Order leader. ``Good people have only to
do nothing to let bad men succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Irish and British leaders take heart that the recently
reinstated Northern Ireland Assembly _ the Protestant/Catholic
alliance created to assume governmental control _ survived, there
were signs that the broad public support for the 2-year-old peace
process was fraying.
</P>
<P>
   Support among Protestants for the 1998 Good Friday accord _
which established the peace process _ was waning, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conversations with ordinary Unionists produced remarks such
as 'Peace - what peace?', 'I'm not a Paisley-ite (referring to the
radical Protestant leader Ian Paisley), but he speaks a lot of
truth', and most tellingly, 'If a referendum were held now, there
would be no majority in favor of the Good Friday Agreement,'''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rodgers, an Orange Order leader in Belfast, believes
Protestants are reacting to the inclusion of Sinn Fein _ the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army _ to the assembly
before the IRA surrendered its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, which like unionist paramilitaries is observing a
cease-fire, says it has placed its weapons beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants believe the Good Friday Agreement has been
implemented in a way that has favored nationalist Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of frustration out there, and I have never
experienced anger like it,'' Rodgers said. ``I don't condone it,
but some Protestants see Sinn Fein in government after IRA violence
and they think if it worked for them, why not for us?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dudley Edwards, a Dublin-based author who has written about
the Orange Order, believes the organization is in danger of
``committing suicide'' over its internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-agreement faction is determined to push out the
pro-agreement faction,'' she said. ``At the top there is a great
sense of drift and a concentration on negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The division was obvious Thursday, when national Orange Order
leaders asked for an end to a virulent protest over the
government's decision to ban them from marching through the
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Orange Order leaders in Portadown vowed to continue their
protest _ which has been cited as the spark that ignited the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange Order leader Robert Saulters said Friday that he was
worried that support for the organization was disintegrating
because of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had enough,'' Saulters said. ``I think it's time
we sat back and reflected.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed deep frustration that his concerns were being
ignored by hard-liners. ``They are not playing the game with us at
all,'' he told the BBC.

 &HT;    ROW OVER RUSSIAN ARMY RESTRUCTURING ERUPTS AMONG GENERALS
 &HT;    (475&AMP;ADD).
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIZHNY TAGILL, Russia _ A squabble among Russia's top brass
about the future of the armed forces spilled over into the public
arena Friday as President Vladimir Putin and his generals attended
a major arms show aimed at spit-shining the military's image.
</P>
<P>
   Military and national security leaders have for months struggled
over ways to restructure the armed forces, and resuscitate the
country's military industrial complex as part of Putin's
overarching goal to overhaul the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, competing proposals came to light during a
closed-door meeting, when Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin, a career
army man, recommended the elimination of the strategic nuclear
forces as a separate branch of the military and folding it under
one of the remaining three.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly described the standing army as in a ``near
critical'' state and suggested savings from cuts in the nuclear
branch could be used to re-equip and better train conventional
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the plan erupted publicly Friday, when Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, who made his career in the strategic
forces, said that a move like this would be a ``crime against
Russia and just plain madness,'' according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the Urals Expo 2000 here Friday, Putin tried to
quell the row among the generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The discussion of restructuring) involves a major,
fundamental decision upon which the country's future depends. Such
a decision cannot be made behind closed doors, but nor can it be
opened up to nationwide debate,'' the president said, adding that
no decision was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   If Kvashnin's measure is adopted, it would disrupt the
international balance of nuclear forces and represent a 180-degree
about-face in the strategic policy of the country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking from the history of parity with the United States
would be a major development,'' said military analyst Nicholai
Novichkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Nizhny Tagill arms show, held at a formerly secret military
base 900 miles from Moscow, was an apt illustration of problems
resulting from the last 10 years during which both the military and
military industrial complex were chronically underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's leading arms manufacturers paraded in front a deadly
arsenal of conventional weapons to about 100 international buyers,
few if any new technologies were exhibited or demonstrated.
Instead, the focus was on presenting modifications of time-honored,
reliable standbys, like the Kalashnikov rifle and the T-90 tank.
Soldiers and factory workers both complained of receiving late
wages, and companies said their future looked grim.
</P>
<P>
   While both generals, Putin and analysts agree that the military
needs to be restructured, just how to do this remains a thorny
problem, involving personal egos, varying ideas of how to protect
national security and a lack of money to pay for changes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the 1.2 million-strong military is organized into
ground, air, naval and strategic forces, which oversee the nuclear
arsenal and are the cornerstone of the Soviet Union's military and
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian weapons makers exhibiting their wares at the arms expo
said their future relied on the government jump-starting weapons
procurement not on one-time sales to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem if the government doesn't resume orders,''
said Vyscheslav Azingareev, the marketing director of the
Chelyabinsk Automatic Mechanical Enterprise, which makes artillery
shells. ``Russia has a saying that if a country doesn't feed its
own army, it will end up feeding another. It's a matter of pride
that we survive these times.''

EXHIBIT RE-CREATES PART OF THE SHACKLETON EXPEDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Just when visitors may think they have wrung all
the drama out of the Endurance exhibition chronicling the legendary
Shackleton expedition to the Antarctic, they are challenged to
imagine its ultimate feat of heroic endeavor and nautical skill.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1914 the British expedition _ led by Ernest Shackleton
and including a team of sailors and scientists _ set off on the
ship Endurance in an attempt to cross the Antarctic continent by
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton did not succeed in that, but at the moment of
failure, he accomplished the even greater feat that secured his
place in nautical history. He sailed a small lifeboat with a
five-man crew across 800 miles of storm-wracked southern ocean to
obtain rescue for the remaining expedition members, marooned on a
frozen and desolate island.
</P>
<P>
   The Endurance exhibition, which originated at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, is now at the Peabody Essex
Museum here. In a darkened room sits a replica of the James Caird,
the 22-foot-6-inch decked lifeboat that Shackleton and his crew
sailed to the whaling station on tiny South Georgia Island in their
desperate rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   To have missed that landfall would have doomed not only the men
in the James Caird, but also almost certainly the men left behind
on Elephant Island. Yet to find the island in the raging, trackless
ocean required navigational skill of the highest order, with no
Loran or GPS or other modern-day navigational aid, just a delicate
hand-held sextant, dependent on the navigator's ability to be held
steady in the rolling and pitching boat.
</P>
<P>
   So in that darkened room, behind the replica of the James Caird,
heaving ocean waves are projected, and the visitor is challenged to
imagine taking a noon sighting with sextants mounted on pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, says curator Daniel Finamore, ``to really capture the
experience, those pedestals would have to be bouncing up and down
and we'd be splashing cold salty water over you.''
</P>
<P>
   However realistic that might make the experience, adds
co-curator Caroline Alexander, it cannot convey the full nature of
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the class of experience you have,'' says Alexander,
``the greater the sense of awe and bafflement.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has spoken with ocean sailors, people who have
experienced the difficulty of navigating under storm conditions,
and, she says, ``they can't begin to explain how that navigation
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a freelance writer who lives in New Hampshire,
developed an ``obsessive interest'' in the Shackleton expedition
after reading his own account, ``South.'' She organized this
exhibit for the natural history museum in New York and has served
as co-curator for its subsequent showings in Washington, D.C., and
here.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the exhibit _ setting the stage for the few moments
of imagined nautical heroics _ is the pictures taken by the
expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander used Hurley's photographs to illustrate ``The
Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition,'' her 1998
account of the expedition. While Shackleton is ``the star of the
bigger story,'' she says, ``Hurley is the star of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley was an adventure-loving Australian photographer _
Alexander calls him ``gifted and gritty.'' Shackleton was banking
on his photographs to illustrate the books and lectures that would
repay the backers of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Hurley was forced to abandon much of his work when
the Endurance, trapped in the ice, finally sank. Shackleton ordered
the glass negatives destroyed to prevent Hurley from trying to
salvage them.
</P>
<P>
   But what remains _ 150 are in the Peabody Essex show _
represents what Alexander calls ``one of the great feats of
photography.'' They are ``world-class images,'' she says, for ``a
world-class story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley's still photographs have illustrated numerous accounts of
the expedition. Less well known is the fact that he also had a
movie camera. His footage of the men working on the ice with their
sled dogs after the ship was trapped gives a human dimension to the
story. And the footage of the ship's final days, augmented with
animation, is grim, even terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is prepared for that,'' says Alexander. ``Even if they
know about the loss of the Endurance, it is a real blow to see the
crushing by the ice as it unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the story leaves a ``sense of awe and of what is
wonderful _ awe of the landscape and awe of the human saga,'' she
says. ``It is a story you want to tell somebody. It is not a story
you want to sit with in silence. You want to discuss it. You want
to play it out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Endurance exhibit runs through Sept. 10. The Peabody Essex
Museum is located on East India Square in Salem, adjacent to both
the MBTA commuter rail station and municipal parking. It is open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, noon to
5 p.m. Admission is $10, $8 for seniors and students over 16, free
for children 16 and under. For information, call 978-745-9500.

SEASON BY SEASON, A MULTICOLOR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By ANNE RAVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I planted my first hydrangea (Hydrangea anomala petiolaris)
beside the old smokehouse down on the farm, and it just sat there,
like a raggedy bunch of sticks, for a few years. I was prepared for
this, having read that the climbers take a while to establish their
roots. And besides, I had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen one winding up an old oak tree on Long Island years
before, and its lateral branches fanned out like long arms, cloaked
in dark green heart-shaped leaves and laced with flowers that
reminded me of white doilies, glimmering in the dappled shade of
the oak leaves. These lacecap flowers are flat-topped clusters of
tiny, greenish fertile flowers surrounded by a handful of creamy
white sterile florets.
</P>
<P>
   The climbing species have aerial rootlets that cling to walls or
tree trunks without harming them, and unlike wisteria, which can
destroy a brick wall or shingled roof, do no damage. Now, my
eight-year-old climbing hydrangea is rambling over the smokehouse,
forming a wonderful cover for the birds that hop about the feeder
near the kitchen window. And in winter, the flaky cinnamon-colored
bark of the woody vines forms a striking pattern against the
building's white walls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I have admired other species, like the oakleaf
hydrangea, H. quercifolia, so-called for its deeply lobed leaves,
which turn a purplish bronze in the fall. The botanist William
Bartram discovered this species blooming on the banks of the
Altamaha River in Georgia in the 1770's, and in his ``Travels in
the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida,'' he described it growing in
copses, spreading by stems that rose six feet from rambling roots.
</P>
<P>
   The footlong panicles start out creamy white, then turn
successively rose and russet, remaining on the shrub all winter.
And though it's a Southerner, this plant is hardy to Zone 5, coming
back from the roots when killed down to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   H. quercifolia can make a wonderful unpruned hedge or border, or
clumped in twos or threes to light up an open woodland garden. It
seems to do best in light shade, as the leaves tend to dry out and
lose their color in full sun. Hydrangeas also do not cotton to
lime, which is good news for those of us with acid soil.
</P>
<P>
   I also love the old-fashioned H. paniculata grandiflora, called
peegee hydrangea (for p.g., its initials), which garden snobs scorn
for being overused, but as with bell-bottoms, what goes around
comes around. Paniculata is easily pruned as a tree, which grows to
30 feet, with panicles of white flowers that turn pinkish-purple,
then brown, like the one that captured my heart years ago on a
country road in Oyster Bay, on Long Island. This spring, as I
planted H. paniculata, only four feet high, I tipped my cap to that
old beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The genus hydrangea includes more than 100 species, all woody
shrubs or vines, with flowers ranging from the lacecap type to
mop- &QC; heads (which some call hortensias) to footlong pyramids. And
the family keeps expanding, thanks to plant explorers like Daniel
Hinkley, owner of Heronswood Nursery in Kingston, Wash., who has
brought back many new forms, from a mophead Hydrangea aspera from
the mountains in Sichuan, China, to a climbing evergreen species
collected in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkley's Heronswood catalog lists more than 80 cultivars,
including many macrophyllas (so familiar to beach-side porches)
ranging in color from blue to ``lemon souffle braised with a
raspberry glaze.'' The catalog is an invaluable primer on the care
and cultivation of hydrangeas, offering descriptions of the
different species and their cultivars.
</P>
<P>
   You can help your macrophyllas turn a more intense blue by
making the soil more acidic. Hinkley suggests digging in peat moss
before planting, and applying a nitrate-based fertilizer like
25-5-30. Or try adding aluminum sulfate. Conversely, redder hues
respond to more alkaline soil, so add lime. But he warns that with
very acidic soil (below 5.5) or very alkaline soil (above 7), ``it
is virtually impossible to modify your soil pH to a degree
sufficient to change the color of any hydrangea.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other texts are ``Hydrangeas: A Gardeners' Guide,'' by Toni
Lawson-Hall and Brian Rothera (Timber Press, 1998) and ``Ornamental
Shrubs, Climbers and Bamboos,'' by Graham Stuart Thomas
(Sagapress/Timber Press, 1992). Thomas describes these plants to a
T, and tells what looks good with them. H. arborescens Grandiflora,
for example, found growing wild in Ohio around 1800, produces big
creamy flower heads so heavy they droop on their stems. Turn that
weakness into a strength by letting them hang over low walls,
Thomas advises. Plant Japanese anemones, he suggests, with H.
aspera macrophylla, which has large flat heads of mauve flowers
surrounded by white sterile florets, which turn pink with age.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I love about hydrangeas. Their faces keep changing
with the seasons.

 &HT;    SENATE PASSES ESTATE TAX REPEAL, MOVES ON TO 'MARRIAGE PENALTY'
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up a pair of politically charged
confrontations with President Clinton, the Senate approved a bill
Friday to phase out the federal estate tax and immediately began
work on erasing the ``marriage penalty'' tax.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has pledged to veto the estate tax bill. In a sharply
worded statement from Camp David on Friday, he called it a
``budget-busting ... irresponsible and regressive bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said half of the bill's benefits would go to about 3,000
families, ``while more than 10 million Americans are waiting for an
increase in the minimum wage and tens of millions of seniors lack
dependable prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 59-39 vote fell eight votes short of the two-thirds needed
to override a veto. Nine Democrats voted for the measure, while
four Republicans voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill last month by a margin large enough
to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   A final Senate vote on eliminating the marriage penalty could
come early next week. The bill, which would cost the government
$248 billion over 10 years, would modifying a quirk in the income
tax law that results in about 25 million two-income married couples
paying higher taxes than they would if unmarried and filing
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the marriage bill for a second time Wednesday
under rules designed to restrict Senate debate and amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also criticized this bill, but recently offered
Republicans a deal in which he would accept it if they accepted his
proposal for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope to force Clinton into taking action on both
popular tax-cutting bills before their national convention begins
July 31 in Philadelphia. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive nominee, strongly supports both measures.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote on the estate tax bill, senators removed a
series of amendments added over the last two days that were
designed primarily as political ammunition for senators seeking
re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dropped amendments would have:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ended the 3 percent telephone excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rolled back the amount of Social Security payments eligible
for taxation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Given research and development investments by businesses
permanent tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hailed passage of the estate tax bill as a major
accomplishment and called on Clinton to join them in eliminating
what they call the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this morning is over, the death tax will be on its way to
the dustbin of history, where it belongs,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott said shortly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the estate tax and the marriage penalty, GOP Whip
Don Nickles said, ``these two taxes are the most unfair taxes we
have on the books. You shouldn't be penalized for death, and you
shouldn't be penalized for marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would raise the threshold for the maximum 55 percent
tax rate from $3 million to $3.675 million next year, while
gradually reducing the top rate to 40.5 percent by 2009. The tax
would be repealed in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that repealing the estate tax would allow
families the option of deciding when to liquidate a parent's assets
by shifting the time when a property was taxed from when it was
inherited to when it was sold. Assets left from one spouse to
another are exempt from taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, noted that among family businesses
which have existed for at least five years, 70 percent do not
survive to a second generation and 80 percent do not make it to a
third. He attributed that largely to the estate tax, which has a 55
percent top rate on assets over $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also eliminates over 10 years the federal tax on gifts
in excess of $10,000 and the generation-skipping tax, which taxes
certain assets left from a grandparent to a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to cost $105 billion during the first 10 years
and $750 billion during the next 10 years, when it would be fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued during the debate that the Republican plan was
geared primarily to the rich and would do little to aid small
businesses and family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax affects about 2 percent of the households filing
income taxes. About half of those have assets in excess of $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., suggested that because of the high
cost, Congress would back away from repealing the estate tax before
the bill was fully implemented, leaving lower rates for the
wealthiest without helping small businesses and family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us agree we should essentially repeal the estate tax
for small businesses and family farmers ... but the Republicans
insist on repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest estates in
America,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats offered an alternative plan that would have raised the
individual exemption from $675,000 to $2 million by 2010. It would
have raised the exemption on a family-owned business or farm from
$2.6 million per couple to $8 million per couple by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative, which would have cost the government
$64 billion in lost revenues over a decade, was rejected Thursday
by a vote of 46-53.

MARKET INSIGHT: A SAPLING WITH LIMBS THAT REACH TO THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe trees can grow to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will confuse it with a sequoia, but just now JDS
Uniphase, the fiber optic component manufacturer, sure is
sprouting.
</P>
<P>
   Until a little over a year ago, JDS and Uniphase were separate
companies. Then they merged. The combined company has since bought
four others, counting SDL Inc., a big rival that it agreed to
acquire last week for a tidy $41 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares have certainly been popular currency. When
the JDS-Uniphase merger closed in July, 1999, the market
capitalization of the combined company was about $14 billion. At
the end of last week it was close to $100 billion, and that is down
about one-third from its 52-week peak.
</P>
<P>
   Nikos Theodosopoulos, a communications equipment analyst at UBS
Warburg, spent some time last week talking about the company and
its latest deal. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Investors are clearly excited over the prospects for this
industry. How big is it, and how fast is it growing?
</P>
<P>
   A. We estimate the fiber optics components market, which is what
JDS Uniphase sells into, will be about an $8.5 billion market this
year, and will grow somewhere between 50 percent and 70 percent
this year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Q. JDS Uniphase's growth is vaguely reminiscent of the strategy
that Cisco Systems has employed over the last decade, using its
stock to buy companies and to grow. Is that a fair comparison?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is similar to Cisco, but JDS Uniphase has really collapsed
the time frame. All of these deals have happened over the last 12
months or so, which is much more concentrated than Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   They have had a good currency in their stock and a very strong,
visionary management team. They have used the two to build the
leading supplier of fiber optic components, and in the process
pre-empted everyone else from doing what they have accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did JDS Uniphase want SDL?
</P>
<P>
   A. SDL manufactures the best pump laser chips and modules in the
industry. And of the three main technologies that facilitate the
splitting or combining of light, JDS Uniphase has leading market
share in the thin-filled filter technology, but doesn't have much
of a presence in array wave guide. SDL does.
</P>
<P>
   The other point to emphasize is that this is a consolidating
industry. Corning was in negotiations to buy SDL, and others may
have made similar overtures. So this deal keeps SDL from being
acquired by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who are the company's competitors?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, Corning is one. Lucent has a microelectronics division
that competes, and Nortel is a competitor to a lesser degree. And
there are number of competitors in Japan, companies like Furukawa.
There are a few others that have recently gone public, but they are
much smaller players.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see any problems with the deal for SDL?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two risks, and the biggest one is regulatory.
</P>
<P>
   We think the deal will be approved, but JDS Uniphase may be
asked to sell something to get it done. Worst case, they may have
to spin out their pump laser chip facility in Zurich. That is where
JDS Uniphase and SDL have a combined market share of between 70
percent and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other risk is integrating these two companies, which is a
risk with any merger.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the optical market is so hot and so strong the
companies are operating as if they were independent. It's not as if
there are redundancies. The risk is making sure excess capacity can
be found. There is not a cost-saving element, but a challenge to
realize the synergies and generate new products.
</P>
<P>
   Q. JDS Uniphase shares were pounded for a couple of days after
the deal was announced and then recovered. Is the stock likely to
bounce around for awhile?
</P>
<P>
   A. Since this deal will get regulatory scrutiny, the stock will
be manipulated more than normal by risk arbitrageurs. And since the
deal isn't likely to close until the end of the year, for the next
five months or so the stock may not perform very well.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you are right, and the stock doesn't do much over the next
few months, does that period represent a buying opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   A. We don't anticipate a slowdown in their business, because
bandwidth and the Internet continue to grow, and new high-speed
applications continue to grow. Fundamentally, they are in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   If you have more than a four-month time horizon, this is a good
time to buy the stock. We think this is a core long-term holding.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is certainly expensive. But that is the nature of the
market right now for very high growth sectors. People are paying a
premium for companies that are growing very, very rapidly.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eyeing the buying and selling patterns of corporate
insiders has for years been a good way for outside investors to
gauge a company's prospects. After all, company insiders have
access to much fresher and more detailed corporate intelligence
than those who buy stocks with their noses pressed up against the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, investors focus on insider activity in
individual stocks. But the overall numbers can also be revealing.
That is why the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in
Minneapolis, has studied large block trades made by insiders over
the years. ``We're looking for the large transactions that indicate
a large level of conviction about what an insider thinks their
stock is going to do,'' said Eric Bjorgen, a senior analyst at the
firm. ``If a lot of them are doing the same thing at the same time,
it shows a broad trend.''
</P>
<P>
   To spot the trends, the firm compares the dollar amount such
large block sales, net of block purchases, with the total value of
the stock market. It defines a big block as a transaction of at
least 100,000 shares or $1 million in value.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to 1983, researchers at Leuthold found that the
percentage of market value made up of insider sales moves in a
fairly tight range. When the amount of big block sales represents
the smallest percentage of overall market value _ one-tenth of 1
percent _ it has often been a good buy signal for the overall
market. Conversely, when block sales hit the top end of the range,
seven-tenths of 1 percent of the market's total value, it has
typically marked a good time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, for instance, block sales approached eight-tenths
of 1 percent of market capitalization, a sell signal to the
statisticians at Leuthold. The next year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 1.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a buy sign flashed in early 1995, when big block sales fell
to one-tenth of 1 percent of market value. Later that year, the
market began its historic four-year advance.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorgen notes that the indicator's buy signals have been more
reliable in recent years than its sell signals. That is largely
because, even as insiders sold big last year, the overall market
continued to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the net block sale numbers have now gone
certifiably off the charts. So far this year, insider block sales,
net of buys, have totaled $36 billion, double what they were in the
corresponding periods of 1998 and 1999. When weighed against total
market value, insider block sales now account for a full 1 percent.
That is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that these figures have gone sky-high recently may
have to do with the fact that more insiders typically own greater
numbers of shares today than they did in the past. These days, the
amount of executive compensation tied up in shares of company stock
_ options and restricted stock, for example _ is far greater than
it was even four years ago. With more stock being dispensed to
insiders up and down the corporate ladder, it is perhaps not
surprising that more shares come up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps even the current outsized figures do not mean that a
major downturn is imminent. But the hefty sales certainly help
explain why, even as money has been flooding into equity mutual
funds, the overall market has stalled this year. According to AMG
Data Services, buyers have put $169 billion to work in equity
funds. But as Bjorgen pointed out, 21 percent of that buying has
been neutralized by insider selling.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, today's selling levels can hardly be construed as
bullish. After all, it is indisputable that these blocks represent
insiders making a big bet that their company's stock is not going
higher in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you aggregate all the activity together over the last
year, insiders have become increasingly concerned about their
exposure to their companies,'' Bjorgen said. ``Insiders have
sometimes been early, but they've usually been right.''

I SHOULD NOT BE A CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By BOB MORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making a good home video of a party isn't for the thin-skinned.
I learned this the hard way last weekend in Vermont at a big
backyard party given by some friends turning 40. With a borrowed
camcorder, I intended to make a tape as a gift and went around
asking guests to share reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The witty brother of one of the celebrants refused flat out and
suggested I shoot his new car instead. A friend who isn't shy told
me to go away, and others turned their backs. Then someone stuck
his hand over the camera lens, Sean Penn-style, and I turned the
thing off and got a stiff drink. What was going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost wrote, ``Something there is that doesn't love a
wall.'' The same, I guess, can be said about a camera. It's hard to
imagine it in this moment of pervasive reality TV and voyeuristic
talk shows, with people sharing and oversharing at the least
provocation. John De Mol, the creator of ``Big Brother,'' told
Newsweek that if he announced a show of 10 people on an airplane
with only nine parachutes, applicants would line up to risk death
as long as it was televised. So why did so many of my friends
resent being taped?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the distrust goes back to ``An American Family,'' the
1973 documentary on PBS that was so devastating to the Loud family.
Perhaps people don't know where the tape will end up. Who, for
instance, would know that those homey home videos of Elian Gonzalez
would be seen on TV screens across America?
</P>
<P>
   Was it Diane Arbus or Frederick Wiseman, with their cool, cruel
eyes, who fueled the distrust? ``When you stick your nose in the
faces of some people,'' a friend who made documentaries in film
school tolds me, ``they're going to want to bite it off. Not
everyone's going to react well to your stealing a piece of their
soul with your camera.''
</P>
<P>
   I know what she means. Recently, I was mortified to watch a
travel photographer treat a Saint's Day procession on Sardinia as
if it were a runway show. No wonder Susan Sontag has likened the
shooting of a camera to the shooting of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe people thought I was being inauthentic _ that some
experiences should be enjoyed for what they are, not captured
through a lens. A friend who works at a public access TV station
didn't want a video of her own wedding. ``I prefer to remember it
as I experienced it,'' she said, ``not as a sequence of images
captured by a camera.'' OK, but what about eight-millimeter home
movies, those lovely, silent reminders of our radiant pasts? Are
they more meaningful because there's no sound?
</P>
<P>
   When I got home and reviewed my tape of the party, I was shocked
to find myself a noisy presence, prodding each person from behind
the camera. Carrying a tiki torch for lighting, I had invaded the
hot tub near the orchard, which did not go over well with the group
of women in it, although they did manage to say meaningful things,
even while wrapped in towels. One woman trying to reminisce about
our birthday boy's band at high school dances could hardly get a
word in for all my interrupting.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the tape is not about a lovely party, but about me
being an intrusive guest. The lesson is that you have to let your
subjects take you where they want to go. That's what real reality
TV would be. And that's how good documentarians (and polite people)
move about in the world.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how Ricky, the video-obsessed neighbor in ``American
Beauty'' who captured that plastic bag dancing in the wind so
poetically, would have recorded this party. I wonder if I can have
my rude voice edited out before giving the tape to my friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're scripting every moment,'' one man told me as he looked
into the camera. ``You have a poetic urge to dominate.'' It's a
judgment that's all the more brutal because it's true. I'm not
sure, though, if it makes me want to work through my intense
control issues or simply work them. Maybe the only thing I've
realized, having played Big Brother for a night, is that what I
really want to do is what everybody else wants to do in this
I-am-a-camera-crazed culture: direct.

CORNELIU MANESCU, 84, LEADER IN ROMANIA REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corneliu Manescu, a former Romanian diplomat with a reputation
for integrity who became a courageous opponent of Nicolae
Ceausescu, his country's dictator, died on June 26 in Bucharest,
the Romanian capital. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In the revolution in 1989, which led to the overthrow and
execution of Ceausescu, an early report in the West said a new
government was being put together by Manescu, who was foreign
minister from 1961 to 1972 but spent much of the '80s under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As the revolution progressed, a soundtruck trumpeted Manescu's
name (pronounced kor-NEHL-yoo mah-NESS-koo). He became, briefly,
titular leader of the provisional administration that succeeded
Ceausescu in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before he took over, the anti-Ceausescu forces _ a
mixture of army generals, student leaders and communist political
figures who had been under detention _ had moved quickly to create
a provisional government under Manescu.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1989, Manescu was one of six elderly former officials
who wrote the dictator a letter accusing him of wrecking the
economy and terrorizing the population. ``All the leaders of the
non-communist nations of Europe refuse to meet with you,'' the
letter said, adding that the security forces, created to defend the
socialist order against the exploiting classes, had been turned
against workers and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   All six writers, evicted from their houses and made inaccessible
to foreign journalists and diplomats, were relegated to
dirt-floored dwellings on the capital's outskirts, under police
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Manescu, who was also a former member of the Communist Party
Central Committee and a former lieutenant general, stayed under
house arrest until a few days before Dec. 22, 1989, when forces
loyal to Ceausescu were fighting for control. On that day, Manescu
announced to the nation on Romanian television that he was heading
a ``national salvation front'' that would hold power until free
elections could be held.
</P>
<P>
   But he was ill and seemed a pale shadow of the dashing 6-foot-2
figure that he cut in 1967, when he was a diplomat hurrying through
the corridors of the U.N. General Assembly as its first communist
president, presiding over a stormy debate on the Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   Manescu was born in Ploesti, in central Romania, the son of a
minor government clerk. He went to local schools, received a law
degree in Bucharest and rose to national prominence, becoming
deputy armed forces minister from 1948 to 1955 and holding other
high posts.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Ceausescu began to deteriorate in the
'70s. By 1984, Manescu had lost his seat on the Communist Party
Central Committee, and he was apparently in semiretirement in the
period before the 1989 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, the former Dana Dobrescu, whom he
married in 1950, and a daughter.

HOW PLAYING COP CAME BACK TO HAUNT NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. -- Sporting a wide grin, the governor of New
Jersey is shown patting down a young black male on the streets of
Camden during a 1996 State Police drug sweep. The picture is grainy
and unfocused, like a home snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction in the week since the photograph was published
has been anything but unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans say the image shows the governor to be
insensitive and proves she does not understand how deep racism runs
in the State Police. State troopers and their supporters say it
exposes the governor as a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   This week Gov. Christie Whitman said she regretted the decision
to frisk the unarmed suspect, but stopped short of an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake moving from just an observer to
participating,'' Whitman said at a news conference in Princeton.
``I shouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The following account of how the photograph was taken and how it
came into public view is taken from more than a dozen interviews
with state troopers, lawyers and state officials, many of whom
insisted that they not be named. It is the story of an admittedly
naive governor whose anticrime zeal led her into a racially charged
situation that, four years later, has come back to haunt her at a
time of maximum political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May 1996, an elite unit of the New Jersey State Police
was in the midst of a five-month project designed to get drug
dealers off the streets of Camden, the state's poorest city.
Because it was raining that night and there was little action on
the streets, troopers had returned to their rally site, the
Bellmawr New Jersey State Police Barracks, just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Over pizza and beer, the several troopers talked about the big
news of the day: Whitman was coming to Camden the following night
to ride along with the State Police drug-busters.
</P>
<P>
   A trooper and a lawyer familiar with the gathering that night
say Capt. Edgar Hess, head of the operation, threw out a challenge:
Anyone who got a picture of the governor frisking a suspect in
Camden would get a week's vacation. (Hess has denied that he made
such an offer.)
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Whitman, like many governors in statehouses
around the country, was intent on being a law-and-order chief
executive. She was opening boot camps for juvenile offenders,
pushing tougher anti-drug laws through the Legislature and, in
recent days, had been focusing on the troubles in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   With the homicide rate spiraling out of control, then-Camden
Mayor Arnold Webster had personally pleaded with Whitman to send
the State Police in to help patrol the streets of the crime-ridden
city. Col. Carl Williams, superintendent of the New Jersey State
Police, had objected.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have the officers to spare, he said, and he feared it
might cause tension between local police and the state police.
Other cities might make similar requests, William said, and it
would be difficult to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in comments about the photo, Williams said, ``It was
not my idea for the governor to do this. I was against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was overruled by the governor's office and state
troopers were dispatched to Camden. From January to late May 1996,
troopers from throughout South Jersey were selected from various
sections and units to work regular sweeps against local drug
dealers. The effort was called the Camden City Initiative, CCI for
short.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers combed the streets of Camden, frisking young men,
raiding drug dens and attempting to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basically report-free,'' said one trooper, explaining
that the unusual freedom the troopers were given made CCI a
sought-after assignment. Troopers just stopped people, and if they
found something illegal, they turned the person over to the Camden
Police, the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no paperwork. It was just a show of force,'' the
trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   When troopers learned Whitman would be coming, they were
encouraged, he said. They felt she was sanctioning their mission
and that they did not have to worry about getting any heat later
for anything that occurred in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was giving us more rope,'' said a trooper who works in the
Bellmawr barracks. Getting the Whitman photo was seen as a lark, a
sort of frat-house prank or game.
</P>
<P>
   During her two-day tour of the city, Whitman jumped in with both
feet. She wore a bulletproof vest, went into crack houses and stood
by as troopers conducted searches.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 p.m. on her second night in Camden, six troopers
accompanied by Whitman pulled up to the corner of Lansdowne Avenue
and Rose Street in two vans, one blue, one white. A group of young
black men had gathered around the stoop of a shuttered bar.
</P>
<P>
   Quayson Davis -- ``Q,'' to friends -- said he was one of the
young men at the scene that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were chillin'. We was drinking. We weren't bothering Mrs.
Whitman or nothing,'' said Davis, now 19. They were rounded up and
told to stand with their palms against the graffiti-riddled side of
the building as the State Police officers frisked each one.
</P>
<P>
   When troopers urged her to pose for a photograph while patting
down an African-American male stopped on a city street, Whitman
agreed, troopers say. But she had one condition. She wanted gloves,
one trooper at the scene says.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get the prize photograph, troopers quickly supplied the
governor with a pair of black Kevlar gloves, special bulletproof
gloves used in police work.
</P>
<P>
   Donning her gloves, Whitman, dressed in a white jump suit, was
happy to respond to the photo request, troopers recall.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says the man Whitman patted down was last in line at the
wall. His name, Davis says, is Sherron ``Ron G'' Rolax, who was
just shy of his 17th birthday. Rolax's uncle, Anthony English,
confirmed that his nephew had told him about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Rolax was not arrested that night. He was found to have no drugs
in his possession. But, according to state records, he is now in
the Mountain View Youth Correctional Facility in Annandale on 1998
drug charges. Rolax, now 21, refused to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman began patting down Rolax, Trooper Joseph Senatore
was ready with the camera, according to troopers familiar with the
operation. A classmate of Hess' who stands an imposing 6 feet 6
inches tall, Senatore, now 48, whipped out a Polaroid and began
snapping away. He handed a photo to Whitman but she declined,
troopers recall, allegedly saying, ``Keep it as a souvenir.''
</P>
<P>
   Senatore refused to comment on the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Col. Robert Dunlop, who held the rank of major at
the time, had been assigned the role of setting up the Camden
program.
</P>
<P>
   He does not believe he was on duty that night in Camden, but
does not specifically remember. He does recall hearing that
Senatore took the
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do know that,'' Dunlop said in an interview. He said
never saw the photo until it was printed in newspapers, but had
heard of it shortly after it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he said, the photo was seen as an innocent
memento of the governor chumming around with the troopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was anything other than she was doing a
ride-along with the troopers. She had come to Camden to show
support to the troopers, the murder rate was up to 60 and it was
almost a lawless town,'' said Dunlop.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of Whitman's two-day visit, then-Attorney
General Deborah Poritz, who is now chief justice of the New Jersey
Supreme Court, tagged along, as did John Whitman, the governor's
husband. Ex-State Police head Williams Thursday said Poritz and
Peter Verniero, then-chief counsel and now a justice in the Poritz
court, were along for the ride the night the photo was taken.
Whitman, Poritz and Verniero all denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   After that night in Camden, Senatore held on to his photograph.
Other troopers say they saw it. ``It was passed around like a pack
of Marlboros,'' recalled one, but it eventually faded to the
background of troopers' memories.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late 1998 and 1999, the force found itself embroiled in
charges of racial profiling and internal discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As scrutiny of the State Police intensified, Senatore decided to
turn the photo over to an attorney for safekeeping, according to a
law enforcement source.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Moran, a Mount Holly lawyer who is suing the State
Police on behalf of dozens black state troopers, heard about the
photo earlier this year. Several weeks ago he began asking for a
copy of it from Attorney General John Farmer Jr., saying it was
relevant to his claims against the state.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Attorney General's Office told Moran that it was
not aware of any such photo. It added that Moran did not need to
file a subpoena, but could simply ask for it as part of the
discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   But, law enforcement sources said, the attorney general's
investigators began looking for the photo. They assumed that if
such a the one in Camden. But the State Police said their
photographers had taken no such photos.
</P>
<P>
   It was then, sources said, that several troopers remembered
Senatore and his photos.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:45 p.m. July 3, the day when the Attorney General's Office
was supposed to respond to Moran's request, Senatore was asked by
state officials to give up the photograph. He referred them to his
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is not clear. But within days, the photograph
ended up in the hands of a national wire service reporter, John
McAlpin of the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman officials say privately that the release of the photo
makes it obvious that Whitman's enemies wanted it published at the
moment it would do the greatest damage to her just weeks before the
Republican National Convention was scheduled to kick off across the
river in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the photo makes it clear that after two years of
attempting to reform the State Police, Whitman has few friends in
the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   One trooper said some troopers are so angry with Whitman they
would do anything to embarrass her. They had even discussed putting
the the caption: ``Arrive on vacation. Leave on probation.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have a friend in the State Police on either
side,'' said the trooper. Many white troopers remain angry with the
governor, the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   She angered them by admitting racial profiling, firing Williams,
and hiring Col. Carson Dunbar, the first African-American to serve
as State Police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of two white troopers charged with attempted
murder in connection with the April 1998 New Jersey Turnpike
shooting of three unarmed minority men further hurt her relations
with white troopers, a black trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   But some black troopers are not happy with Whitman's
administration either. They are irate that the state continues to
refuse to settle civil rights lawsuits brought by dozens of black
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are enjoying watching her twist in the wind,'' the
trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an elite unit,'' the trooper said of the CCI unit on
duty in Camden that night. ``There were no black troopers in it.
The white troopers took the picture, held the picture and released
the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Steve Rogers, president of the New Jersey Community
Policing Association, said he feels no sympathy for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is getting what happened to Carl Williams,'' he said.
``For months she has been politicizing this issue by painting a bad
picture of the New Jersey State Police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see a bad picture of her on the front page of The
Star-Ledger'' of Newark, Rogers said. ``The governor will now know
how it feels to be falsely accused of being a racist.'' KC END

PEDRO MIR, 87, WHOSE POEMS SPOKE TO LATIN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro Mir, the poet laureate of the Dominican Republic, who gave
voice to the emotions of multitudes of working-class Latin
Americans, died Tuesday in Santo Domingo, his country's capital. He
was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Mir, who was often called Don Pedro, wrote in Spanish. He was
``without a doubt, the vital voice of Dominican poetry of the 20th
century,'' Ylonka Nacidit-Perdomo, director of the Center for
Literary Research of the country's National Library, said after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Mir was awarded an honorary degree by Hunter College in
New York with a citation saying: ``Critics have called you `a great
political poet' who writes of `the Latin American proletariat' and
`interprets faithfully the feelings of the people.' Enormous
audiences come to hear you read your poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   In February of last year, Venezuela's new president, Hugo
Chavez, declared in an address to his nation: ``Let's give our
children and our grandchildren a homeland we do not have today. I
will never forget the verse by the Dominican poet Pedro Mir: `If
someone wants to know which is my homeland, he will not have to
look for it. He will have to fight for it.' I urge all Venezuelans
to fight so that we can have a homeland, a truly democratic
Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Mir's book ``Countersong to Walt Whitman and Other Poems''
(published by Azul in the United States in 1993), a collection of
his poetry in bilingual format, with English translations by
Jonathan Cohen and Donald D. Walsh, was applauded by Roberto
Marquez in The Village Voice Literary Supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``His poetry achieves a rare, exceptionally felicitous marriage
of poetry and politics, of individual sensibility and the
chronicling of quotidian collective drama, the still unfulfilled
promise of Latin America, its landscape, peoples, and societies,''
Marquez wrote. He added that Mir's work ``pays tribute to the
resilience, unyielding endurance, yearning for release, and
periodically stunning audacity of the region's ordinary, slighted
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the poems in ``Countersong'' (first published in Guatemala
in 1952) is the resonantly optimistic ``Concerto of Hope for the
Left Hand,'' which foresees a time when:
</P>
<P>
   the atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   trembles with the unbridled percussion of
</P>
<P>
   the underdeveloped
</P>
<P>
   kettledrum, the universal orchestra
</P>
<P>
   thunders,
</P>
<P>
   the great concerto of humanity shakes
</P>
<P>
   its insides, the timpani lets out a shriek
</P>
<P>
   the laws of history vibrate beneath the feet
</P>
<P>
   of the double basses while the cellos
</P>
<P>
   of the human heart resound and erupt
</P>
<P>
   deafeningly throughout all the confines
</P>
<P>
   in a rousing solo of hope.
</P>
<P>
   In a quieter vein Mir once wrote of his homeland:
</P>
<P>
   There is a country in the world
</P>
<P>
   positioned in the path of the sun
</P>
<P>
   native to the night
</P>
<P>
   placed in an unlikely archipelago of sugar and of rum.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades he was a professor of aesthetics at
the National Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, where he also
taught creative writing. He also worked as a journalist in his
homeland and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known poetry books include ``Hay un Pais en el Mundo''
(``There Is a Country in the World''), ``Amen de Mariposas''
(``Amen of Butterflies'') and ``Viaje a la Muchedumbre'' (``Journey
to the Masses''). He also wrote fiction, including the novel
``Cuando Amaban las Tierras Comuneras.'' His nonfiction books
include ``Fundamentals of Art Theory and Criticism'' and ``Overture
to Aesthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given the title of National Poet in 1982 and was awarded
the Dominican National Prize for Literature, for his life's work,
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mir was born in San Pedro de Macoris, 40 miles from Santo
Domingo, to a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban-born father. By the
time he was in his mid-'30s, he was well enough known as a writer
for his views to stir the wrath of Rafael Trujillo, his country's
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   He fled to Cuba in 1947 and spent 15 years in exile there and in
Mexico and the Soviet Union. (It was in Cuba that he published
``Hay un Pais en el Mundo'' in 1949.) He went back to the Dominican
Republic after Trujillo was assassinated in 1961. There he became
active in the Popular Socialist Party, which no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Carmen Masejo; two sons, Luis
Pedro and Hugo Fernandez; and two daughters, Geraldine and Celeste.

   Cox News Service mistakenly reported Thursday that Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, co-authored a letter to President
Clinton opposing his nomination of El Paso lawyer Enrique Moreno as
a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. Hutchison
neither wrote nor signed the letter, which was authored by Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison does oppose Moreno's nomination, said press secretary
Lisette Mondello, who issued the following statement: ``This
process has approved 17 Clinton judges, while only two have been
turned down, but it was late in the term and the (Judiciary)
committee was not comfortable with an appellate court appointment
for a person who had no judicial experience and no written
record.''

&HT;     CAMPING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: TEEPEES, BOATS AND YURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Camping doesn't get any stranger than this, and
for many who have tried, it doesn't get any better.
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Oroville, Calif., there are these strange, double-decker
floating camps, kind of like giant patio boats without motors,
along with floating bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out there are several camping options available for a
strange and usually wonderful experience across Northern
California, including teepees at two private campgrounds and a yurt
at a state park. Any can add new dimensions to a summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters for unusual camping opportunities is at Lake
Oroville, the giant reservoir in the foothills of the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   The first time you see the double-decker floating camps, you
might think they are a weird-looking houseboat. Nope. It more
closely resembles a floating group camp. They sleep 15 people and
include picnic table, sink, food locker, life jackets, garbage can,
vault toilet, propane barbecue and water (not suitable for
drinking). It costs $85 a night during the week, $125 a night on
weekends and holidays, but get this, next year the cost will go
down to $42 a night, and it will be the best family camping deal in
the state. A comparative experience on an anchored houseboat at
Lake Shasta can cost $3,000 a week, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you need a boat to get there. But that provided, it
is ideal. You have all day to fish, ski, explore or just play in
the water, then return to your floating camp for meals, sleeping or
just to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you're on vacation, right? Oroville is an outstanding
lake for water sports, with warm water and plenty of room and also
has excellent bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Oroville has 10 floating camps. Reservations are available at
(800) 444-7275 or Web site: www.cal-parks.ca.gov. For information,
call the Lake Oroville Visitor Center at (530) 538-2219 or the Lake
Oroville State Recreation Area at (530) 538-2200.
</P>
<P>
   For boaters, Oroville also has a series of dispersed boat-in
camp sites around the lake. Of course, there are about 20 lakes
that offer boat-in camping in Northern California. The best
opportunities are at Bullards Bar Reservoir east of Marysville.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the few lakes in the Sierra Nevada to offer
boat-in camping at developed boat-in sites and to allow boaters to
create their own primitive sites anywhere along the lake's
shoreline. A chemical toilet is required gear for boat-in shoreline
camping. A developed boat-in site is also available. It is called
Garden Point, located on the western shore of the northern Yuba
River arm. For information, call Emerald Cove Resort and Marina,
(530) 692-3200.
</P>
<P>
   You say that's not strange enough for you?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are also camps with teepees and another with a yurt.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps with teepees are privately operated: Yogi Bear
Beaver Creek RV Park (real name, seriously), located in the
foothills of Lake County south of Clear Lake, and at Stewart
Mineral Springs, located adjacent to the west flank of Mount
Shasta.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Bear Camp has two teepees and four cabins to go with the
standard RV and tent sites common at drive-to camps, and this is
the closest location to the Bay Area where you can camp in a
teepee. This is a good camp to bring youngsters, with a pond with
canoes and kayaks available, a trout creek and trails for hiking
and birding. Horseback riding is also available nearby. But you say
you want strange? You can also arrange for a ride in a hot-air
balloon nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This camp is located near Highway 175 between Middletown and
Clear Lake near Cobb Mountain. The teepees cost $25 per night and
sleep up to five. For information, phone (707) 928-4322 or check
out their Web site at www.campyogi.com.
</P>
<P>
   Stewarts Spring is better known for its mineral spring baths,
and a following among the ``new-age people.'' It's almost like a
cult here, but the headquarters is a 100-year-old lodge with
cabins, apartments and, yep, teepees. The rite of passage is
getting boiled in a mineral bath, or sweating in a sauna, then
jumping in cold Parks Creek, which runs through the center of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   The park is located in forest in the foothills of Mount Eddy,
facing Mount Shasta. Views are nearby, though not available from
the park itself.
</P>
<P>
   For information, phone (530) 938-2222.
</P>
<P>
   But if only a yurt will do, then you must head to Patricks Point
State Park.
</P>
<P>
   What's a yurt? Actually, yurts are common in the Pacific
Northwest, where it rains so much, and that should tell you
everything you need to know. A yurt is a camping platform with a
roof to keep the rain and coastal moisture from fog off you while
you sleep. And you can get one at Patricks Point.
</P>
<P>
   Patricks Point is a beautiful place, filled with Sitka spruce
and offering an easy, beautiful hiking trail with coastal lookouts
and access to several private beaches. It's also a great place to
see passing whales.
</P>
<P>
   At the north end of the park, a short hike to see the bizarre
``Octopus Trees'' is one of the strangest walks around, with trees
that are growing atop downed logs, their root-system exposed like
octopus tentacles. A Native American village has been constructed
by the Yurok tribe here.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in the yurt here costs $40 per night, available by
reservation at (800) 444-7275. Starting Jan. 1, the fee will be cut
in half. For information, phone the park at (707) 677-3570.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Anytime is a good time to make hay
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was standing in front of the tire store where
my Cousin Bubba works, waiting on him to get off for lunch and
listening to a couple of fellows talking about haying.
</P>
<P>
   You might not think that hay means much to you, personally, and
maybe it doesn't. Maybe you're somebody who doesn't care much,
personally, about a good hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Hay just happens to be the main ingredient, lower down the food
chain, for hamburgers, not to mention thick, juicy steaks.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're going to have meat on the table, somewhere you
have to have beef on the hoof and hay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And wherever you have hay, you have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it's been a good year for hay, that can be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you have more hay than you can use, you sell what you don't
need. Problem is, when there's a lot of hay, the price is low. You
can lose money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If it's been a bad year for hay, you won't have enough. Then
you'll have to buy extra. Problem is, when there's not much hay,
the price is high. It'll cost you dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Hereabouts, it's been a pretty good year. Well, so far, anyway.
That's as close as any farmer will ever admit to a good year.
</P>
<P>
   The county has enjoyed a better than normal rainfall. The ag
agent hasn't had very many calls about army worms. All and all, the
hay crop is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so far, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year started out good. Then it quit raining July 20, and
seemed like it was never going to start up again.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we're in a two-week drought. The ground is drying out
and beginning to crack, young shade trees are showing stress, pond
levels are dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Make hay while the sun shines, they'll tell you. Better that you
made yours while we were still getting some rain.
</P>
<P>
   Countywide, we have about 6,000 acres in hay, out of 60,000
acres of forage production, out of a county that's 600,000 acres in
size.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, it's Bermuda grass and Bahia grass. Horses like Bermuda
better, with its higher protein value. Bahia is more drought
resistant, and cows can get along on it.
</P>
<P>
   Cows have four stomachs, you know, and horses just the one. It
takes four stomachs to stomach Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   You know Bahia when you see it, even if you don't know what it
is. Bahia has a forked seed stem that looks like a ``Y'' sticking
up.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad about invading lawns. You can mow it down one day, and
it'll be grown back three days later.
</P>
<P>
   A bale of hay, if you happen to be in the market, costs about
$2.50. Figuring by the pound, that seems cheap enough. A bale of
hay -- four-feet long, two-feet wide and two-feet thick _ weighs
60-65 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the old fashion bale. Nowadays, hay is baled in huge
rolls, taller than a tall man, and looking like giant pieces of
shredded wheat breakfast cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for baling in rolls, like most anything else, is
economics.
</P>
<P>
   A roll weighs 1,000 to 1,500 pounds, and requires no more time
and effort for the hay fork operator to pick up than a regular
bale. You're saving a lot in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   And that ain't hay.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. For lunch, instead of hamburgers, my Cousin Bubba and I had
a salad. That's because we're both trying to cut down the size of
our girth. Right now either of us look like we could get along on
Bahia grass, what with our four stomachs.

 &HT;    VOTERS SHOWING RECORD LEVEL OF APATHY
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. With VOTERS-DATA Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Voters are more disengaged in the presidential race
this year than at any time in recent history, according to an
extensive survey of American attitudes towards politics released
Friday by a non-partisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   Good economic times and a sense that there is little difference
between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush has lulled
voters into ``a rather pleasant sleep,'' said pollster Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The flagging voter interest could be an indication that turnout
this fall may sink to a new low, Kohut said. In 1996, only 49
percent of eligible citizens cast ballots, the first time in more
than 70 years that less than half of voters went to the polls to
elect a president.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew poll found that fewer than half of registered voters _
46 percent _ said they have thought a lot about the election, a
decline from 55 percent in 1996 and 63 percent in the same period
in 1992. The drop-off in voter interest and familiarity with the
candidates is especially pronounced in young and middle-age adults.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance that turnout will drop below the 1996
level, and ``it seems virtually certain,'' Kohut said, that it will
be lower than the 55 percent of voters who came to the polls in
1992, when Bill Clinton defeated incumbent George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, Americans said they are more satisfied with
their choice of presidential candidates this year, and they are
less critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, 73 percent expressed satisfaction with the
candidates compared to 49 percent in 1996, when former Sen. Bob
Dole won the GOP nomination to challenge President Clinton.
Sixty-six percent of Democrats said they were satisfied this year,
compared to 56 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The poll concluded that the race between Bush and Gore remains
wide open as the candidates head to the nominating conventions next
month. The survey found that likely voters are split between Gore
and Bush _ 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecidrty candidates
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan will not have much impact on the race,
Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly believe that the election of the
president is not as important as it was a decade or two ago, the
poll found. Nearly half of Americans _ 49 percent _ believe things
will pretty much stay the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey, conducted among 2,174 adults June 14-28 with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, mirrors
other recent polls which indicated that voters see little
differences in the two major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   This is despite their divergence on issues such as government
spending and social issues such as abortion and gun control and
whom each might pick to fill expected vacancies on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in play, but it would seem from our polling data
that American voters are dissatisfied, distracted or just don't
care,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar on government and the media at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found that fewer respondents are following news
about the campaign than did during the same period in 1996 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kohut also noted that the degree of voter interest could
change dramatically after the nominating conventions and if Gore
can energize Democratic and independent voters. He also said the
current voter disinterest could be due, in part, to the early
victories on Gore and Bush in the primaries that has created a lull
in media attention on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush enjoys an ``enthusiasm edge,'' with a greater proportion of
voters who described themselves as Republicans supporting him than
do Democrats who say they support Gore. Only 47 percent Democrats
said they strongly support Gore, compared with 56 percent of
Republicans who counted themselves as strong supporters of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, a slim majority of voters, no matter who they support,
said they believe Bush will win the election. Fifty-one percent
predicted that Bush will win, compared to 34 percent who said Gore
and 15 percent who said they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents ranked Bush higher on leadership abilities, while
giving Gore the edge on key issues important to voters, such as
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how fluid voters attitudes can be, the Pew
survey, conducted over a two-week period, detected a significant
shift in support from Gore. Between June 14-21, Gore led Bush 42
percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The following
week, amid news reports that a recommendation had been made for an
independent counsel to probe the vice president's 1996 campaign
finance activities, Gore fell to 35 percent compared to Bush's 42
percent, with 19 percent undecided.

OLD CONFLICTS

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ To the spiritual strains of ``The Battle Hymn of
the Republic,'' President Clinton took the stage on Thursday before
several thousand attendees at the annual convention of the NAACP in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He'd journeyed there from Camp David, the presidential retreat
where he's trying to hammer out a peace accord between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to come to Baltimore,'' Clinton told the jubilant
NAACP crowd, on their feet, applauding, cheering and waving small
American flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``You embody the spirit of freedom and reconciliation we're
trying to capture there, that we need so badly at our talks,''
Clinton said. ``So I wanted to be here especially during these
peace talks to draw strength from you and take the spirit of the
NAACP back to Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long goodbye guiding his downhill glide from power,
Clinton has returned to the very themes of reconciliation and the
search for common ground among former foes that have formed the
heart of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he searches for a Middle East peace accord _ and
prepares to travel to Japan on Wednesday to begin raising money to
support an agreement, if one is reached, from U.S. partners in the
Group of Eight _ Clinton is reaching, again, to his core belief
that there is no conflict so ugly, no history so tortured, that it
must forever cloud the hopes and dreams of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   It's a belief Clinton turned to last month, in opening trade
with North Korea just days before he marked the 50th anniversary of
the outset of the Korean War, and again, on Thursday, when he
lifted trade sanctions against Vietnam, a quarter century after the
bitter U.S. conflict there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is one more reminder that former adversaries
can come together to find common ground in a way that benefits all
their people, to let go of the past and embrace the future, to
forgive and to reconcile,'' Clinton said in remarks on the White
House lawn. ``From the bitter past, we plant the seeds of a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is precisely what Clinton is trying to do with
the Camp David talks that continue through the weekend at the
presidential retreat outside this railroad hamlet at the edge of
the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   There's no assurance that he'll succeed in brokering a treaty to
end a half-century of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The summit itself, though is the fruit of seven years of efforts
by Clinton to bring the two sides together around a table where
they can set their mutual animosities aside long enough to focus on
their common interests.
</P>
<P>
   That has been Clinton's favored approach to one problem after
another _ international as well as domestic _ since he took office
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The record of results has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, Clinton has set a rhetorical tone of racial
inclusiveness and reconciliation, two constant refrains of his
presidency. He's made a studied attempt to reflect those goals in
his staffing decisions, his judicial nominations and his efforts to
pass federal hate crimes legislation and to win tax breaks for the
working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton has been criticized by some in the
African-American community for not doing more to combat racial
profiling among law-enforcement, or for going along with a
Republican-authored welfare reform plan that ended benefits for
thousands of struggling, low-income blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, Clinton's efforts to reach across history and
hatred have also met an uneven fate.
</P>
<P>
   There are places, like Northern Ireland, where Clinton's
attempts to shepherd foes into a common pasture remain very much a
work in progress, even as his time in office slips quickly away.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other spots, most notably Rwanda, where Clinton
has seen no clear way to effectively interject his philosophy, or
his country's resources, into difficult conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been places _ Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo _ where
his approach simply hasn't worked, where Clinton opted instead to
deploy massive U.S. military force to try to impose some sort of an
end to conflicts that ruptured societies in ways that ultimately
affronted American values, if not threatened U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   He's after something far different in the Middle East, where his
stated goal is an enduring and comprehensive peace that will
fundamentally change the region and the way ancient foes deal with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   In every application of his reconciliation drive, Clinton has
been inspired, he has said repeatedly, by lessons he learned
growing up in the segregated American South and reading the words
of the late civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full, fair and final peace . . . Dr. King reminded us, is
more than the absence of war,'' Clinton said before the NAACP,
''but the presence of justice and brotherhood and genuine
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are more than just words to Clinton, who has had, at the
heart of his international agenda, the challenge of trying to
integrate into the family of U.S. partners former adversaries like
Russia, China, and, now, even Vietnam and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the road, earlier in his presidency, to strengthening
U.S. ties with Cuba, until Fidel Castro ordered his rusting air
force to shoot down a pair of civilian-operated Cessnas near
Havana, killing four Americans of Cuban descent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited rather than initiated the global shifts
resulting from the end of the Cold War on the watch of President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It has fallen to Clinton, however, to fit together the brick and
mortar of the post Cold War world. In doing so, he's looked largely
to his own instincts for reconciliation, forged, he insists, in the
crucible of the Civil Rights era.
</P>
<P>
   When he traveled to Selma, Ala., last March to commemorate the
35th anniversary of the bloody crackdown by state and local police
on peaceful civil rights demonstrators after crossing the Edmund
Pettus Bridge, Clinton gazed again across the nation's racial
divide in a moment he referred to Thursday as one of the greatest
days of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a son of the South, the brave souls who marched across that
bridge 35 years ago set me free too,'' Clinton told the NAACP
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every movement for human rights in this country is about more
than gaining equal opportunity and equal rights and decent justice
for the oppressed,'' he said. ``It is also about forgiveness and
healing, about letting go and moving on, about giving our children
a better tomorrow.''

 &HT;    VOTERS SHOWING RECORD LEVEL OF APATHY
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. With VOTERS-DATA Moving in (w) Washington and (p)
politics categories.

   WASHINGTON _ Voters are more disengaged in the presidential race
this year than at any time in recent history, according to an
extensive survey of American attitudes towards politics released
Friday by a non-partisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   Good economic times and a sense that there is little difference
between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush has lulled
voters into ``a rather pleasant sleep,'' said pollster Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The flagging voter interest could be an indication that turnout
this fall may sink to a new low, Kohut said. In 1996, only 49
percent of eligible citizens cast ballots, the first time in more
than 70 years that less than half of voters went to the polls to
elect a president.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew poll found that fewer than half of registered voters _
46 percent _ said they have thought a lot about the election, a
decline from 55 percent in 1996 and 63 percent in the same period
in 1992. The drop-off in voter interest and familiarity with the
candidates is especially pronounced in young and middle-age adults.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance that turnout will drop below the 1996
level, and ``it seems virtually certain,'' Kohut said, that it will
be lower than the 55 percent of voters who came to the polls in
1992, when Bill Clinton defeated incumbent George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, Americans said they are more satisfied with
their choice of presidential candidates this year, and they are
less critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, 73 percent expressed satisfaction with the
candidates compared to 49 percent in 1996, when former Sen. Bob
Dole won the GOP nomination to challenge President Clinton.
Sixty-six percent of Democrats said they were satisfied this year,
compared to 56 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The poll concluded that the race between Bush and Gore remains
wide open as the candidates head to the nominating conventions next
month. The survey found that likely voters are split between Gore
and Bush _ 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecided. Third-party
candidates Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan will not have much impact
on the race, Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly believe that the election of the
president is not as important as it was a decade or two ago, the
poll found. Nearly half of Americans _ 49 percent _ believe things
will pretty much stay the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey, conducted among 2,174 adults June 14-28 with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, mirrors
other recent polls which indicated that voters see little
differences in the two major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   This is despite their divergence on issues such as government
spending and social issues such as abortion and gun control and
whom each might pick to fill expected vacancies on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in play, but it would seem from our polling data
that American voters are dissatisfied, distracted or just don't
care,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar on government and the media at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found that fewer respondents are following news
about the campaign than did during the same period in 1996 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kohut also noted that the degree of voter interest could
change dramatically after the nominating conventions and if Gore
can energize Democratic and independent voters. He also said the
current voter disinterest could be due, in part, to the early
victories on Gore and Bush in the primaries that has created a lull
in media attention on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush enjoys an ``enthusiasm edge,'' with a greater proportion of
voters who described themselves as Republicans supporting him than
do Democrats who say they support Gore. Only 47 percent Democrats
said they strongly support Gore, compared with 56 percent of
Republicans who counted themselves as strong supporters of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, a slim majority of voters, no matter who they support,
said they believe Bush will win the election. Fifty-one percent
predicted that Bush will win, compared to 34 percent who said Gore
and 15 percent who said they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents ranked Bush higher on leadership abilities, while
giving Gore the edge on key issues important to voters, such as
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how fluid voters attitudes can be, the Pew
survey, conducted over a two-week period, detected a significant
shift in support from Gore. Between June 14-21, Gore led Bush 42
percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The following
week, amid news reports that a recommendation had been made for an
independent counsel to probe the vice president's 1996 campaign
finance activities, Gore fell to 35 percent compared to Bush's 42
percent, with 19 percent undecided.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To Jerry's credit, he never censored anything,''
said Larry David, the co-creator and executive producer of
``Seinfeld'' for seven years. ``But he vetoed this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' is an incest-themed story line that never showed up on
``Seinfeld'' but that David was taping two weeks ago for his new
show, ``Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' starting on HBO in October. David,
who plays himself, is asked by an old girlfriend to go with her to
a support group for incest survivors. He tries to worm out of it,
arguing that abuse by a stepfather might not count. ``With all due
respect to your ordeal,'' he says. ``There might be a whole other
group for stepthings.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes to the meeting and makes up an incest event of his own.
Later, he will pay, both for agreeing to accompany his ex and for
lying. In David's world, no bad or good deed goes unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld isn't sure he vetoed incest. ``I don't really remember
that,'' he said. But you can see why such a plot twist _ or twisted
plot _ might have raised red flags at their old network, NBC. On
HBO, such sensitivities fall under the forgiving umbrella of
creative license. And the man who wrote and supervised the other
writers of one of the most acclaimed and lucrative sitcoms of all
time gets a lot of license.
</P>
<P>
   Larry David is hardly a household name. But few households do
not know the intimate details of his life, his obsessions, his
euphemistic catchphrases (``master of my domain''). He, not
Seinfeld, had the wacky neighbor named Kramer. He once ruined a
suede jacket worn for a scary meeting with a girlfriend's father.
He was the model for Jason Alexander's portrayal of Jerry's alter
ego, George Costanza. And yet, the only on-air exposure his
millions of viewers ever got to David was his uncanny vocal
impersonation of George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   HBO subscribers got a glimpse of him, though, in an hourlong
mock documentary, also called ``Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' which the
channel has shown every so often since last October. In it, a
camera crew purports to follow David, who is 52, around as he works
the comedy club circuit in preparation for a supposed HBO stand-up
special. It ends with Larry chickening out of the special. Other
characters include his wife and his manager, who happen to hate
each other, various alleged HBO executives and cameos by minor
celebrities. ``Curb Your Enthusiasm'' was directed by Robert Weide,
a documentary filmmaker whose specialty is comedians (most recently
Lenny Bruce). The whole thing was a put-on, but seemed so real that
a friend of the actress playing David's wife was offended that she
wasn't invited to their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``The Larry Sanders Show'' _ only more so.
Coincidentally in sync with ``Survivor'' and the current mania for
voyeuristic programming, David has created a hybrid of extreme
reality and extreme comedy. All dialogue is improvised from a loose
five-page outline that he has written for each of the 10 episodes
of the series. The stand-up scenes and mock-documentary gimmick
have been dropped. But it still has the same verite feel. It's
deadpan in a way that will certainly appeal to critics if not a
mass audience expecting the second coming of ``Seinfeld.'' In some
ways ``Curb'' is subtler and more nuanced, but with the same
unmistakably Seinfeldian structure of snowballing bad luck. David's
desert island may be Los Angeles, but that doesn't make survival
any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is about a guy trying to get through the day with a
little dignity attached,'' said Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of
original programming. Albrecht has known David since the 1970s,
when they were both unsuccessful comics at Catch a Rising Star
here. ``Larry's an incredible everyman,'' he said. An everyman
reported by Forbes magazine to have hit a $242 million jackpot when
``Seinfeld'' was sold into syndication. But unlike Seinfeld, who
collects Porches like baseball cards, David has never really been
able to enjoy his windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly what it does is make you apologize a lot,'' he said.
Unlike the dwarfish, irritable Costanza, David is a rangy character
with a quick smile. He has a penchant for wide-wale cords and
untucked shirts. To look at him, you wouldn't know he was loaded,
but out here, you never can tell. By the pool of the once-glamorous
Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, he ate his lunch during a
break in the incest group scene and subjected himself to questions
about the real Larry David. ``I have quite a house,'' he said.
``People come over and I go, `I know, I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht said David's world view could be summarized as, ``I
know, I should have had the chicken.'' Regret, remorse _ those are
old friends of his comedy. Long ago, he taught himself never to
think about the future because it was too painful for him to
contemplate. ``To regret the past _ yes!'' he said, his voice
rising to a characteristically Costanzan shout. ``To regret
everything about the past _ certainly!''
</P>
<P>
   The present is no picnic either, what with its habit of turning
into the regrettable past. In one episode of ``Curb Your
Enthusiasm,'' in a car-phone conversation with his manager, he
refers to his wife as ``Hitler.'' (Verbalizing things that the rest
of us might think but would never say is a David specialty.) The
manager is in his own car, on his speakerphone, but fails to
mention that his parents are in the back seat. So offended are they
by the Hitler remark that David is later called upon to offer an
apology. (Another speciality is awkward moments.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People are constantly screaming at me on the show,'' he said,
allowing that this is a slight exaggeration of his relatively
civilized existence as a supersuccessful Los Angelino. ``When I was
living in New York, there was a lot of screaming in my life. I
would just get into these altercations all the time. Being in
public, dealing with shopkeepers, just trying to cross the street _
things like that. I'm not in a position where I can scream like
that anymore. I'm not quite as anonymous as I was. And I guess
things aren't as vital to me as they were then.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It was during those struggling stand-up days in New York when
David and Seinfeld became friends. They'd meet at coffee shops and
talk for hours about things like laundry.
</P>
<P>
   As Seinfeld recalled, ``What we had in common was both of us had
the ability to focus deeply on something small, to blow small
things out of proportion.'' One of them was on his way to becoming
one of the most successful comedians in the country. The other
remained a comic's comic, meaning he'd perform in front of five
people and they'd boo him off the stage. Interviewed in the
``Curb'' special, Seinfeld said David would address the audience as
``You people,'' which, as Seinfeld would tell him, ``was a little
distancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of David's pre-``Seinfeld'' career was a stint
writing and performing on ``Fridays,'' ABC's short-lived ``Saturday
Night Live'' clone. Also in the ``Fridays'' cast was Michael
Richards, later to play the fictional version of David's old
neighbor Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom on why the Seinfeld-David collaboration
worked so well is that Jerry made Larry palatable to a mass
audience. They both hate the inevitable Lennon-McCartney analogy.
``Whether it was a dark thing or a light thing,'' Seinfeld said,
``we almost always agreed on what was funny and what wasn't
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The major point of contention was that, almost as soon as they
started doing the show together, David wanted to stop. He had no
more ideas. He constantly worried about keeping it funny. It was
too stressful, he'd complain. After the show had been on for a few
years, executives from Castle Rock, the production company, told
its creators that they were in a position to make some serious
money on the show. Weide recalled David's reaction to this news:
``Larry said, `Great! Now we can take it off the air.''' He finally
left in 1996, returning only to write the series finale in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David's first outing without Seinfeld was not auspicious. ``Sour
Grapes,'' the 1998 movie he wrote and directed, was a black-humored
morality tale of two cousins who fall out over money: One lends the
other the quarters he uses to win a slot machine jackpot in
Atlantic City. Roger Ebert called it ``a comedy about things that
aren't funny'' and didn't stop there. ``I can't easily remember a
film I've enjoyed less,'' he said. Janet Maslin, writing in The New
York Times, was kinder: ```Sour Grapes' should soften the blow of
`Seinfeld's' imminent extinction with the good news that, in
David's merry world of hair splitting and back stabbing, the dream
definitely lives on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers did not agree. Expectations could not have been
higher, except maybe for the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' which
also received less-than-glowing reviews. ``Let them try to write
it!'' David said on the set last week. ``I shouldn't have kept the
script a secret.'' Wincing with remorse, he still feels burned by
the overhype that surrounded that show.
</P>
<P>
   No danger of that happening this time around. David is
determined to undersell himself, even in the title. HBO wanted to
give him a billboard on Sunset Boulevard. No way. ``I don't want to
do anything,'' he said. ``I can't stand reading anything that I've
said. I hate that kind of attention. I don't want articles and
pictures.'' His action plan: ``Let the show sneak up on people.''
</P>
<P>
   In his vampiric fear of the limelight, David is more like a
writer than a performer. But he is remarkably relaxed in front of
the camera, quite at ease playing himself. Much of the comedy of
the series is simply his poker-faced reactions to the terrible
situations he has wrought. And the improvisational style of the
show, having to be funny on his feet, leaves him less time to worry
about his acting, or how he looks.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, he wondered if he was the first bald star of a
sitcom since Phil Silvers, whose show he loved, growing up in the
Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. ``I was thinking about it, but
I couldn't come up with any. I guess, Don Rickles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garlin, who plays Larry's manager, said David's point of
view is defined by three things: ``Anxiety, anger and despair.''
Despite which he manages to be an extremely friendly, likable and
funny guy to be around. Here at the Roosevelt Hotel, attended to by
a personal assistant who looks like Liv Tyler, possibly better, and
no network suits in sight, he seemed ... happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having as good a time as I've ever known Larry to have,''
Weide said.
</P>
<P>
   This miserable fictional Larry is not quite him, after all. His
wife and manager don't actually hate each other. Really, they
don't.

&HT;     FBI ARRESTS MAN WHO SOLICITED `MINOR' ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ FBI agents who monitor children's chat rooms
have arrested a 39-year-old San Jose man who allegedly approached a
teen-age girl over the Internet and planned to meet her for the
first time at the San Francisco Zoo and then have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, 14, turned out to be a grown-up FBI agent pretending
to be a girl, one of a growing number of law officers nationally
who become expert on-line poseurs as they try to crack down on
pedophiles who use the Internet as a hunting ground.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, posing as ``Robin,'' corresponded for 2 1/2 months
with ``Roger'' before a meeting was set up, said FBI agent Andrew
Black, an agency spokesman. Then at 1 p.m. Thursday, the agent _
donning a green hat and backpack as promised in an Internet
correspondence _ arrested Roger Guerrero near the front entrance of
the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, a business manager for Amdahl Corp. of Sunnyvale,
faces a felony count of enticing or coercing a minor to engage in
sex. He could get up to five years in prison if he is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, Black said, is typical of the work of the Internet
Child Protection Initiative, which was launched in March in San
Francisco and employs five undercover FBI agents. The project was a
response to a bevy of complaints from parents about pedophiles
lurking on the Internet, particularly on chat rooms designed for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   The agents patrol chat rooms mentioned in complaints, then set
up a profile of a minor, along with interests like soccer and
music, and wait to see if any adults take the bait, Black said. The
agents do not initiate the contact to steer clear of entrapment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently pedophiles and sexual predators are using this as
another arena to stalk their victims,'' Black said. ``What we're
trying to do is prevent these types of crimes from occurring in the
future. We'd like people to know that if you are a predator of
children, the next person you talk to on line may be an undercover
police officer or agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said Guerrero first contacted ``Robin'' on April 27 and
then corresponded several times. Guerrero, Black said, told the
undercover agent he wanted to have sex with her, spoke in explicit
language and once said, ``I could face 20 years or more in prison
for statutory rape.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent eventually told Guerrero that she was also interested
in sex, and the two set up a meeting that would begin with a trip
to the zoo, Black said. Guerrero reportedly was arrested after he
walked up to the agent and asked, ``Are you Robin?''

 &HT;    FARRAKHAN CALLS FOR 'MILLION FAMILY MARCH'
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam,
called Friday for families of all races and religions to congregate
in the nation's capital on the fifth anniversary of the Million Man
March.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more mellow than militant, Farrakhan said he envisions
a massive, peaceful parade where people seek common goals while
walking under their separate symbols: ``Muslims under the crescent.
Christians under the cross. Jews with the Star of David. I've
invited gangs in the cities to come in their colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Marching beneath their banners will be fraternal organizations,
he predicted: Elks, Shriners and a myriad of other subdivisions of
what he termed ``the human family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to construct a tent where everyone can find comfort
despite our differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His message could have come from the pulpit of a fundamentalist
church.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan quoted from the Bible as well as the Koran. He warned
of moral decline in a society plagued by ``a steady erosion of
family life and corrosion of family values.'' He blasted ``cultural
degeneracy'' on popular television programs and bemoaned the
decline of traditional families with two parents devoted to rearing
good children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is no strong marriage and no strong family, there
is no strong community,'' he said.

<P>
   Farrakhan announced plans for the Million Family March at a
Washington press conference where reporters were frisked by his
followers _ clean-cut young African-American men wearing suits and
ties that matched the handkerchiefs in their breast pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery, controversial Islamic leader, who has endorsed racial
separatism and once called Judaism a ``gutter religion,'' said he
was changed by his recent bout with prostate cancer. He expressed
gratitude that Christians and Jews joined with Muslims in praying
for his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would continue to focus his efforts on the
African-American community but would also heed the ``universal cry
of the human family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not fully recovered,'' he said of his illness. ``By the
grace of God, the cancer is out of my body,'' but he is still
battling ``the after-effects of a very high dose of radiation''
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Family March is scheduled for Oct. 16, five years
after hundreds of thousands of black men gathered on the grassy
mall between the Capitol and Washington Monument in response to
Farrakhan's call for a day of atonement.
</P>
<P>
   There were tangible results to the Million Man March, including
a lower crime rate, he said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the marchers ``must reconstruct the family'' as
society's basic building block, Farrakhan said. ``It is our idea to
remarry a million men to their wives'' and to unite 10,000
unmarried couples into formal matrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said the family gathering will have a more direct
policy agenda than did the Million Man March. It will take place
three weeks before the national elections, he noted, and _ ``if it
is the will of God'' _ a presidential candidate may be endorsed
from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Government is more attuned to the ``greed of multinational
corporations'' than to ``the needs of the masses,'' he said. The
disillusion of Americans of all races is shown by the fact that
more than half of the populace doesn't vote, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The masses of the people are not satisfied,'' he said. ``They
are losing confidence in the democratic system.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that it would take $3 million to $5 million to
arrange the march, but said that most organizing would be on a
local level. The Million Man March cost about $2 million, he added.

TERM LIMITS COLOR CONGRESSIONAL COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ Congress may have
escaped the noose of term limits when the Supreme Court struck down
state attempts to set congressional tenure in 1995, but term
restrictions are still influencing congressional competitiveness.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of U.S. Term Limits say many of the hottest U.S. House
races this year are the direct result of limits, both self-imposed
by members of Congress or required of state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Stacie Rumenap, the advocacy group's deputy director, said seven
of 10 House members elected in 1992 and 1994 when term limits were
a top campaign issue are sticking to their pledges to leave,
setting up contests for open seats in Florida and South Carolina,
among other states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, limits on state legislative service around the
country are driving those politicians into congressional races,
raising the caliber of competition in several contests. Lastly,
House committee chairmen whose time at the helm has been limited by
party rules are choosing to retire rather than return to the
rank-and-file. Five are quitting this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a start,'' said Rumenap, about the back-door impact of
term limits. Though Republicans gained control of the House
partially on the promise of term limits, legislative efforts to
restrict tenure stalled in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.
Term limit supporters concede it is exceedingly difficult to get
lawmakers to relinquish power once they attain it.
</P>
<P>
   But at present, about 50 House members are serving under
self-imposed limits and U.S. Term Limits says about a dozen current
candidates have agreed to abide by such rules as well.
</P>
<P>
   And term limits can quickly become an issue when candidates who
initially embrace them later get cold feet. Rep. George Nethercutt,
the Washington Republican who became the poster boy for term limits
when he knocked off Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994, is
under intense criticism for reneging and running again this year.
</P>
<P>
   HE WOULD KNOW
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has been kicking the GOP-controlled
Congress as a ``do-nothing'' bunch, trying to evoke the winning
message that President Truman employed in his come-from-behind 1948
campaign. That didn't sit too well with Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C.. Not only is he a member of the current institution impugned
by Gore, but Thurmond actually opposed Truman in that historic
campaign as a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore, I knew Harry Truman,'' said Thurmond in a statement
that took a page from Lloyd Bentsen's famous jab at Dan Quayle in
their 1988 debate. ``I ran against Harry Truman. And Mr. Gore, you
are no Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is he a Strom Thurmond, who lost that battle with Truman
and went on to be elected in 1954 to the Senate, where he remains
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   A SCENT OF LEMON
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Sen. John Edwards wants the federal government to
be more proactive in confronting one of the consumer scams that
continues to ride the currents of the flooding from Hurricane
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat is calling on the U.S. Department of Transportation
to conduct a study of the safety risks presented by vehicles
damaged by flooding, then cleaned up and resold to unsuspecting
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While shoddily rebuilt vehicles can appear cosmetically
attractive, they are likely to be structurally unsound and may fail
to meet even the minimum federal motor vehicle safety standards,''
Edwards wrote to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles damaged by flooding along the Eastern Seaboard have
been turning up in North Carolina and other states with titles that
do not disclose their watery history.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL SEAMANSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Good news! The House of Representatives is firmly on record in
support of large bodies of water _ namely the world's oceans.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution adopted last Tuesday expressed the sense of the
House that a National Ocean Day should be established to
``recognize the significant role the ocean plays in the lives of
the nation's people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The oceans cover 71 percent of the earth's surface and are key
to the life support systems for all creatures on the planet,'' Rep.
Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, informed her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted on a strong 403-28 vote, putting
those members of the anti-ocean caucus on the losing end of the
issue. Who says Congress is all wet?

LET US NOW PRAISE SOCIAL CLIMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 16)  
 By RICHARD STENGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one wants to be called a social climber. It's not a pretty
term. It suggests that you are grasping and opportunistic, and a
vulgarian to boot. A decade ago, Gayfryd Steinberg and Susan
Gutfreund became the poster girls of social climbing, two women who
painted every lily in an attempt to convert cash into cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Today's social climbers are less conspicuous. The reason is that
there is no longer any agreed-upon social establishment to impress.
Today, fame and celebrity represent the highest rung of social
status, and the bluest blood and the biggest bank account are just
tools to make the acquaintance of the movie star or mogul of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair's New Establishment of media barons has taken the
place of Mrs. Astor's 400. Today, the same social swells vie to be
at a party given by Jay-Z or Blaine Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm in favor of social climbing. America was
founded on it. The self-evident truth that all men are created
equal was a license to climb higher than your neighbor. Unlike the
Old World, America gave everyone the same starting line. The result
is what we have today, an aristocracy based not on birth or
bloodlines, but on wealth and fame.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when it comes to social climbing, we don't have a
choice. Social climbing is in our genes. ``During evolution social
status correlated with reproductive success, so genes conducive to
social climbing did better than genes that counseled
indifference,'' says Robert Wright, the author of ``The Moral
Animal: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology.'' In other
words, if it were not for social climbing, we would all still be
stuck in the primordial ooze.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, survival of the fittest often meant the triumph
of the most obsequious. When the human species made what
anthropologists call the Great Leap Forward 50,000 years ago, it
was the smaller, craftier fellows who triumphed. Human history is
just an eternal high school lunch room, where everyone wants to sit
at the cool kids' table. We're all programmed to climb; it's just
that some of us are better and a little more shameless about it.
</P>
<P>
   We less successful climbers look at those who have painstakingly
scaled great social summits and think: Those poor tortured souls,
they can't be happy. Au contraire. Sociologists tell us that people
are happy when they climb just a wee bit higher than their
neighbors do.
</P>
<P>
   An old Yiddish proverb makes the same point: When does a
hunchback rejoice? When he sees another hunchback with a larger
hump. Think about it. You are pleased with your raise until you
find out that the woman with the office next door got a slightly
larger one.
</P>
<P>
   Successful social climbers do feel superior _ after all, that's
why they climb. Neurobiologists have shown that those who ascend to
dominant groups have more serotonin in their nervous systems than
the rest of us do. Serotonin makes us happy. One study of college
students showed that the fellow who became the president of the
fraternity had more serotonin coursing through his veins than the
also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   A triumphant social ascent can hide much of the crass
maneuvering on the way up. Even the oldest money was once new. The
Kennedys were bootleggers. Anne Getty was a streetcar-ticket taker
before she married Gordon. What is Jeffrey Katzenberg but a boffo
version of Sammy Glick? It's not where you start, but where you
finish. Successful social climbers become the object of other
climbers' aspirations. That's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Social climbing these days revolves around celebrity. Yes, there
are more and more glitzy charity dinners for more and more worthy
causes, but the lure these days is celebrity. That's what we mean
by royalty in the 21st century. More than wealth, more than titles,
fame confers the highest status. To be a successful climber, you
must either win fame yourself or cozy up to it. Since cozying up to
fame is a good deal easier than winning it, here follows a short
course for social toadies.
</P>
<P>
   PIGGYBACK ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PROMINENCE: In Victorian England,
one of the most successful modes of social climbing was through
one's associations. If you managed to clamber into the right clubs,
you became a de facto gentleman. In New York, the only association
anyone cares about is your association with the famous.
</P>
<P>
   One of Andy Warhol's less-known dictums was: You can use other
people's status to increase your own. Once dubbed the Edmund
Hillary of social climbers, Warhol was extremely serious about
getting in the right social circles. (His goal was also practical:
Socialites bought a lot more of his pictures.)
</P>
<P>
   Warhol was a master at parlaying one invitation into another
even more exclusive one, using one social summit to scale another.
In his diaries, Warhol, the grocer's son from Pittsburgh, often
mentioned that he invited socialites to his studio to garner
invitations to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   BE A CELEB HAG: These days, there is status and mini-celebrity
by virtue of being friends with a celebrity. People are famous for
being friends with the famous: ``Oh, look, there's that woman who's
Madonna's best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course people who are friendly with celebrities always
emphasize the ease and old-shoeness of the relationship. ``We just
hang out, you know.'' It wouldn't do to be so blunt as to say:
``I'm friends with Madonna to increase my status. She's an
incredible pain, but I'll do absolutely anything to maintain the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   HIRE A PUBLICIST: Before the time of Martha Stewart, when the
demarcations of status were both more rigid and less distinct, men
like Baldassare Castiglione and Lord Chesterfield wrote handbooks
that taught people how to behave at court.
</P>
<P>
   These days, publicists are the sherpas of social climbing. They
help guide the ambitious but inexperienced up the steepest social
cliffs. They do not offer advice, like a Renaissance courtesy
manual, or even charm, which they tend to lack. They provide
invitations to dinners and parties, where they perform
introductions that are more like deal memos than salutations.
``This is Joe, whose Internet IPO took place last year. He's now on
the board of six companies. And this is Caroline; she's a friend of
Leo's.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to go to the right parties? Want to be invited to the right
charity events? Then you need to be on the right lists. And the way
to get on those lists is to hire a publicist. You can increase your
status overnight by putting the highest-status publicist on
retainer. You can't climb to the top unless you're on the right
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SELL, SELL, SELL _ PRODUCT YOU! If you don't have a publicist to
herald your arrival on the scene, I am afraid you have to do it
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who is not American, is always put off by how New
Yorkers give their own or others' curricula vitae when they are
introduced. But this is simply a conversational form of the
peacock's tail, a description of one's fitness to ascend the social
ladder. It is so much more seemly if you can have someone like
Peggy Siegal blow your horn for you. Her job is to name-drop so you
don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T WORRY, BE SHAMELESS: Traditionally, the best way to
scramble up the ladder was not to seem to be doing so. If you are a
social climber, the conundrum is that the greater your desire to
ascend, the more transparent are your efforts to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the obviousness of your effort was the very
thing that prevented you from achieving your goal. But that is no
longer true. Nobody cares anymore that Judy Taubman was a beauty
queen before she married Alfred Taubman, the majority owner and
former chairman of Sotheby's. (Although they do care if he gets
indicted.)
</P>
<P>
   The very ostentatiousness of Gayfryd Steinberg's social climbing
did not disqualify her but became her signature. Wanting to succeed
is no longer a disqualification for success. Self-promotion is no
longer a demerit or a disqualifier. Madonna was applauded in both
social and show-biz circles for being a ``genius'' at
self-promotion. No one even gives it a second thought anymore. It's
just the price of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   DO UNTO OTHERS: The trick of social climbing is to let the
object of your status cravings know that you can offer something
that that person is interested in. Let's say you can introduce that
person to a movie star your quarry does not know. Or you can get
her into a very trendy restaurant where she has not been.
</P>
<P>
   This is the favor exchange of social climbing: I do a favor for
you, and you lift me into your social circle. Evolutionary
biologists call it reciprocal altruism, but there is really nothing
altruistic about it. It is simply a quid pro quo that advances both
of our interests.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be ashamed of your social cravings. They are the most
natural thing in the world. They are a sign that you are ambitious
and that you are setting goals for yourself. And do not relax.
Remember, you can always go a notch higher. The duchess of Windsor
married a prince, but she never snared the title she really
coveted, Royal Highness. Happy climbing, and don't look down.

COUTURE DAYS: PERFECTION AT SAINT LAURENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It is, to begin with, a perverse world. Only 1,000,
maybe 1,500 women are rich enough, spoiled enough and otherwise
bored enough to buy haute couture clothes. And if they are very
rich, they don't even bother coming here at all. They send their
private planes to have the fitters from the big houses brought to
them. You can imagine what this adds to the price of a $50,000
dress trembling with illusion pearls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a very specific world nonetheless, its influence and
entertainment value extending far beyond the thin women who sit
shank to shank along the gold-toned front row. There was Nan
Kempner on July 12 at the Yves Saint Laurent show, sitting a few
chairs away from Catherine Deneuve and Lauren Bacall, the sort of
classy dames who have been called ``broads'' and don't cry about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kempner's chin was raised, she leaned forward like an egret in
tall grass. Now she saw something her brain told her she couldn't
live without _ yes, a coat of toffee-colored wool over a cloque
velvet dress _ and her lips formed a word that anyone could read,
if one looked: ``Fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, who now
also presides over Saint Laurent ready-to-wear, scanning the
runway, his eyes sucking in every detail like a pair of giant
hoses. One can't help feeling that Ford, despite his own place in
fashion history, wants badly to have even a little of the
savoir-faire that Saint Laurent tosses about as lightly as coin.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ford called the show, the penultimate of the fall
2000 couture collections, ``perfect.'' And it was, too, in every
way, from the loden and charcoal day suits that seemed right for a
slow walk in a cold abbey to the coy buttocks-revealing evening
dresses that were clearly Saint Laurent's way of saying to Ford
that he had the younger man beat by a mile in the deluxe sin
department.
</P>
<P>
   But ``perfect,'' it turns out, is not the most interesting thing
Ford had to say about the Saint Laurent show. Rather, it was, ``By
the 10th outfit, you're into his world.''
</P>
<P>
   That world is fading fast, to be sure, but on Wednesday, at 1:20
p.m., when the crowd rose for a genuine ovation, it was as if, said
Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, ``Father
Time had woken up.''
</P>
<P>
   And none too soon, either. This has been a mixed bag of a
season. Karl Lagerfeld put on a smart, lively show on July 11, with
bouffant-teased models in electric tweeds gliding along a clear
plastic platform floated on a local public pool. Oscar de la
Renta's show for Balmain on the evening of July 10 had client
clothes galore, many of them good, especially a high-waisted black
taffeta skirt of the Balenciaga genre with an oddly seductive
childish white blouse.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian Lacroix's collection, which opened with mink and
motorcycle leather dyed in improbable Ho-Jo tones of orange and
turquoise and ended with the couture equivalent of the
everything-on-it bagel _ a gown dowsed with five different trims _
seemed an exuberant muddle. Yvan Mispelaere, a former Prada
designer, who showed his first collection for Louis Feraud on July
11, went astray with nursery prints and other naive gestures that
sophisticated couture clients rarely bother with.
</P>
<P>
   And though Viktor &AMP; Rolf's show on July 12 combined conceptual
brilliance with David Lean-style visuals _ models drifting through
a near-white mist as their clothes jiggled with masses of tiny
bells _ it, too, seemed lost.
</P>
<P>
   So the day belonged to Saint Laurent. There have been a lot of
Saint Laurent shows in recent years when nothing clicked and you
thought, `OK, this is as good as it's going to get.' But the thing
one realized the other day was how vast and deep are Saint
Laurent's reserves of creativity compared to those of other,
younger designers who blow themselves out early, and then spend the
next 10 or 15 years splashing around in the same puddle.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent recalled for an over-stimulated audience how
fashion can suddenly look new just by giving it a sense of harmony
and proportion. He put classic knee-length coats in toffee or
petrol-blue tweed over slivers of cloque velvet cocktail dresses in
Cognac brown or midnight blue. Vestal robes, as pure as Grecian
drapes, came out in warm shades of brown, purple and blue, while an
evening jacket of slick, silvery-green feathers tapered over a
column of lacquered black velvet.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare when clothes work on an emotional level _ it makes you
see how very little of the effort that goes into making couture
seem new or shocking actually produces a tenth of the shock that
Saint Laurent gets by showing a well-cut jumpsuit, or finishing an
outfit with a pair of suede gloves. It's also rare for a designer
to be able to challenge a younger generation's frank sexual
references by slyly referring to his own.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if anyone but Saint Laurent had sent out a model
wearing nothing except some baroque pearls and a buttocks-revealing
skirt, he would have been dismissed as a flaming old codger. But
Ford, and his chic brothers and sisters, know better than to avert
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from giving the season a sense of perspective, Saint
Laurent and Lagerfeld, who used to see a lot of each other in their
younger years, showed how to base a collection on a concept. This
sounds like a simple thing to do, but it's surprising how many
designers get so taken with an abstract idea that they can barely
express it in words, much less in clothes. (This may have snagged
Lacroix, who in his program notes wrote, ``Couture's history, never
quite the same nor quite something else, is part of history.'' The
clothes were no clearer.)
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld is the most consistently far-sighted designer in
Paris. He reads, he writes, he converses, he jokes, he remembers.
And all this flows in a clear train of thought into the clothes he
designs. This season for Chanel he moved away from some of the
volume of the past year or so, with narrower shapes, shorter
hemlines and sack-back jackets, although some of the perky suits,
including one in black wool that wraps ingeniously around the
waist, have flaring skirts.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of nubby tweeds (a trend this season) with wide
metallic leather belts that were sometimes inset low on the waist
of a coat dress or woven into the front of a tweed jacket flecked
with the same electric hues. The colors gave the clothes a kind of
hot-rod vivacity, especially with the black patent leather and
clear vinyl boots Lagerfeld showed on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   So the models walked on water. They had muffs of distressed
tulle on their shoulders and their hair was back-combed in the
perennial style of Deeda Blair, a longtime Chanel client, and the
1950s model Dovima. There were evening looks in pink and watery
blue paillettes. Lagerfeld also showed tailored tulle, notably a
severe, exceptional-looking dress with crisp pleats left to fringe
on the ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very Chanel,'' he said, ``but she would never have done a
dress like this. That's my job, no?''

<P>
   De la Renta brought to Balmain, and the more than 50 regular
clients in the front row alone, a lot more substance than last
season. Suits, some in salt-and-pepper tweeds and worn with chaste
white blouses or fur tippets, told the story for day. For evening,
de la Renta seemed to have plucked Lagerfeld's notion from spring
of pairing a short jacket with a full New Lookish skirt.
</P>
<P>
   On the way into the Viktor &AMP; Rolf show, someone wondered aloud
if it had been sponsored by Philip Morris. Suffice it to say, the
thick, water-based mist made for a lot of innocent groping. It
seemed an intriguing idea, encrusting ladylike couture clothes with
masses of tiny bells, and then inviting people to listen as the
models approached like sleighs through a blizzard. The disgruntled
bays of the photographers in another part of the room certainly
added an unexpected Chekhovian charm.
</P>
<P>
   But when the model Carmen Kass emerged, and Andre Leon Talley,
an editor at large for Vogue, leaned in and asked if her long
jingling vest was heavy, which is what everybody wanted to know,
Kass said in a weary voice, ``Yes, it's heavy.'' And that seemed to
say it all.

   RUSSIA-RAVE (St. Petersburg) _ From afar, lasers and strobe
lights could be seen bursting mutely from within the island fort,
as if it were being consumed by some mysterious battle,
transforming it into a radiant beacon amid the 3 a.m. twilight
covering the Gulf of Finland. But as the ferryboat loaded with
young people docked after its three-hour voyage, music pulsating
from the turreted fort broke the stillness. On the first weekend of
July, as many as 10,000 Russian youth laid siege to an abandoned
and crumbling Czarist structure some 30 miles off the coast of St.
Petersburg for dancing, performance art and general merriment
during the season of northern Russia's White Nights, when the sun

MORE CODSWOLLOP FROM THE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coven of conservatives assembled in what co-conspirator
William F. Buckley Jr. announces as ``the off-the-record meeting of
20 right-wing editors, writers and diverse others'' has completed
its election-year game plan, and their approach is as follows:
</P>
<P>
   They will back George W. Bush on a theme of ``the identification
of George W. with _ well, the manly virtues.'' I am not making this
up. Croons William, ``He is a man's man, and as such, a woman's man
derivatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us leave aside the question of whether we men are not all
derived from the other gender: Is a man not born of woman,
Will-yum? But the epicene quality of the conservatives' editorial
war on Al Gore is remarkable, is it not?
</P>
<P>
   Buckley breaks cover with the argument that Dubbaya's ``career
and pursuits underline an intuitive understanding of a division of
duties.'' Right, babe; me hunter, you gatherer. ``This means,'' Big
Bill interpolates, ``that men should not affect to be other than
men, and should not scorn the responsibilities of fatherhood and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Whazzat mean? Is the implication that Al-the-androgynous is a
closet cross-dresser? Listen closely: ``In contrast, Gore is the
man who seems to deplore his manhood, so concerned is he for the
composite human being, part male, part female, one-quarter Asian,
one-third African-American and one-tenth gay.'' For the
lip-readers, the Bill's bottom line is: vote for Dubbaya, 'cause
the other guy's not a real man.
</P>
<P>
   You know the drill: real men eat meat, thump chest, shoot gun,
execute convicts, watch football, scarf Lone Star Beer, sneer at
feminists and gays and people of different cultures, and drive
pickups, and did I leave anything out?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in his Friday column that ran in the Globe and elsewhere
did Buckley address Bush's camouflage slogan, that W. is ``the
compassionate conservative.'' The word ``compassion'' drives
right-wingers nuts, apparently. To them it means abortion, welfare,
cheap prescription drugs for the elderly, Section 8 housing, a
minimum wage, unemployment comp, Medicare and Social Security _ all
of them things the conservative movement has either opposed in the
past, or wishes to unravel in the next Bush reign.
</P>
<P>
   This lifting of the veil on the coming right-wing editorial
jihad is an unusually forthright acknowledgement of an underhanded
tactic best left unexplained. Denying the manhood of your opponent,
when said opponent is male, is the ultimate insult on the
playground, the playing field, or in politics.
</P>
<P>
   And denigrating the plodding Democratic standard-bearer as
something less than a man is apparently a core element of the
rubbish-the-other-guy strategy of the conservative movement again
this year. They tried it with spending millions on ads demeaning
Clinton-the-wimp. They did it with Dukakis-the-mope, who wouldn't
slaughter a rapist or do the manly thing and execute prisoners. The
right-wingers even tried it against George (Wimp Factor) Bush Sr.
till he nailed down the post-Reagan GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question this strategy works. You've heard about the
gender gap? Right-wingers beat left-wingers among white males in
the South and West, particularly, because Democrats are seen to be
pro-women, pro-abortion, pro-welfare, and, let's face it,
pro-black. The notion of the embattled white males fighting against
the tide of feminisim, diversity, and gay rights is firmly
entrenched in the Sunbelt, particularly.
</P>
<P>
   And sneering at the Democrat as some kind of wimpy girly-man is
an election-year staple of the entrenched right. Nixon, who gave us
the racist Southern strategy that still profits the GOP to this
day, got up his Hard Hats Brigades in a classic manuever to
discredit the antiwar movement by saying real men were pro-war.
</P>
<P>
   Er, William: Was Jesus not a man? Is the Pope not against the
death penalty? Is it wrong to succor the sick, clothe the naked,
feed the hungry? Are gays not among all God's children, Bill? Does
the Almighty really sort out the saved by checking resumes?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have to genuflect to NRA archangel Charlton Heston to prove
my chromosome count is correct? Or is this just the usual
disgusting smear-by-sexual-innuendo that prurient right-wing
editors serve up every four years?
</P>
<P>
   Buckley recounts how conservatives mistrusted President
Eisenhower for being supposedly ``wobbly'' on the communist threat.
Ike won World War II for the democracies in Europe, is all he did,
fending off the Russkies in the process. But to the
Red-under-every-bed claque that Buckley defends, Ike was a dupe, a
dope, a ditz: ``He had not risen to the challenge posed by the
Soviet repression of the freedom fighters in Hungary, while
undermining the British attempt to recapture control of the Suez
Canal, and had proved ineffectual in hand-to-hand diplomacy with
Khruschev.''
</P>
<P>
   What a load of codswollop. The right then, as the right now,
yearns for a rollback of history, to the day when rich white males
who spoke the King's English ruled not only Britannia but every
other oil patch. Real men don't eat quiche and don't fall for this
garbarge. Gore may be a plodder, but he went to Vietnam, which is
more than Bush Jr. did, and to suggest he is a failed male is cheap
gutter politics, of the type we expect from the paranoiac right.

THE SUMMER'S MOVIE HUMOR IN A WORD: UGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's Note: This story is rated PG-13 for mild references to
bathroom humor. Those who substitute more graphic references will
have their mouths washed out with soap.)
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe battles against all odds in ``Gladiator'' and
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg take on Mother Nature in ``The
Perfect Storm,'' yet one of the more memorable moments on screen
this summer involves an intense discussion between a drug dealer
and a racist sociopath _ set in a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw ``Shaft,'' you know the scene. About halfway through
the movie, drug dealer Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright) and rich
racist Walter Wade (Christian Bale) are arguing. Hernandez, who is
sitting on the toilet, finishes the conversation with a bowel
movement. Discussion over.
</P>
<P>
   We got more potty humor when ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' opened: A
big dog relieves itself on the lawn of cowed cop Charlie
Baileygates (Jim Carrey), Baileygates returns the favor a few
scenes later. Then he sprays urine all over the bathroom after a
night of cavorting with Irene Waters (Renee Zellweger).
</P>
<P>
   Why is Hollywood resorting to gratuitous bathroom scenes the way
it uses sex, violence and language for shock value? Is this
entertainment? More importantly, is it really necessary for plot
development?
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, watching _ and hearing _ people do
their private business on screen has become a staple of the Austin
Powers movies, TV's ``South Park,'' and shows such as ``The
Sopranos,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and more.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes set in bathrooms and/or featuring characters urinating or
defecating are not totally new _ recall the campfire flatulence in
``Blazing Saddles,'' Ewan McGregor diving into a toilet in
``Trainspotting,'' Jane Fonda on the potty in ``Fun With Dick and
Jane,'' John Travolta being gunned down by Bruce Willis in a ``Pulp
Fiction'' potty scene.
</P>
<P>
   And there isn't an episode of ``Ally McBeal'' that goes by
without a key scene taking place in the unisex bathroom.
Invariably, we listen to detectives on ``NYPD Blue'' discuss cases
or their personal lives while at the urinal.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by ``Shaft'' and ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' it looks as
if bathroom scenes are becoming more graphic and unnecessarily
realistic. For perhaps the ultimate gross-out effect, how about the
scene in last year's ``Austin Powers II'' where Austin drinks
liquefied poo?
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been primed for this _ it's been a long time
coming,'' says Texas Christian University sociologist Mike
Katovich. ``We've run out of lines to cross with sex, and we've
moved on to bodily functions _ it may be the last frontier. Sex and
violence and language have all had their day.''
</P>
<P>
   This belief is echoed by several in the film industry, all of
whom note that the convergence of cable TV, grittier network shows
such as ``Blues'' and the success of movies with bathroom humor,
such as ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``There's Something About Mary,''
in the last several years has sent the message that toilet humor
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time someone takes a taboo and breaks it, it opens the
floodgates,'' says University of Texas at Arlington professor and
filmmaker Andy Anderson. ``It's, `Here's another device we can
use.' It's the idea that, `Now you can set dialogue here and set
scenes here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And target audiences have gotten younger and younger,'' he
adds, ``to the point that it's part of their daily routine of
humor. It's 13-year-old humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says that including urination in a movie can work for
more than a cheap laugh. In his movie ``Detention,'' which was
shown the first year of the Fort Worth Film Festival, several
students are caged by a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   He included a scene where one of the male students urinates
between the bars because he ``wanted the audience to feel the
uncomfortableness'' the captives were experiencing. ``What do you
do if you're a hostage? I had to deal with it _ it was a metaphor
for their complete lack of privacy,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   The problem filmmakers often have, he says, is that they ``are
running out of ways to stage things and places for humor. Everybody
knows what a kitchen signifies, or a bedroom. And now you've
increased the type of room you can set things in. In `Shaft,' that
means that you can show a guy's dominance over another guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current blockbuster-driven film landscape, where there is
so much attention focused on what a movie grosses in its first
weekend, the competition for the moviegoer's dollar has grown more
fierce. The boundaries of what is acceptable or tasteful are
expanding, with a ``can we top that'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have Jeff Daniels taking a laxative and making all
those terrible noises in ``Dumb and Dumber,'' the next film has to
go past that,'' says Ryan Brennan, co-founder and co-director of
the Fort Worth Film Festival. ``It's like sex scenes in the '60s _
people see something, and pretty soon they get used to it. Toilet
humor has become an easy laugh, like slipping on a banana peel used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And people DO laugh _ or groan or yell ``Gross!'' And they often
leave the theater happy, even if a particular scene was
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, Katovich says, they get ``an emotional attachment
to something that gets them to feel something. It stirs something
that makes you feel alive, which is what artists try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Katovich calls this the Lenny Bruce Syndrome: People were
grossed out by the troubled '60s comedian, but they would say later
that they liked his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't like something, you get excited about it,''
he says. ``It gets your adrenaline pumping. It's like the shower
scene in ``Psycho'' _ I saw it when I was young and it scared me to
death, but I wanted to see other Hitchcock movies right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But, one could argue, there's a major difference between a
horrendously scary, perfectly executed scene such as the one in
``Psycho'' and watching Jim Carrey urinate in ``Me, Myself &AMP;
Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, horror movies are meant to frighten, and profanity
and bathroom scenes can be used artfully for dramatic effect.
Watching people go to the bathroom for the fun of it, however, how
artistic is that?
</P>
<P>
   Not very, Anderson says. He says the large number of toilet
scenes recently are ``political incorrectness by proxy,'' the work
of lazy filmmakers dumbing their work down to pander to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, toilet scenes may have already hit a wall, because
there's so little left to show, and because people may be getting
tired of them. ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' has not performed nearly as
well as its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will go the way of profanity _ it'll become commonplace,''
says Brennan. ``There's only so far you can go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, meanwhile, figures there's still more ground to cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually a big star will do this and it'll becoming `daring
acting' and win an Academy Award,'' he says. ``It's easier than
being genuinely funny, but it will fade away.''

MILKING THE TEA TREE

<P>
   Organically speaking, ginseng, ginkgo biloba and St. John's wort
might have to share the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Given Americans' continued fascination with all things natural,
Australian tea tree oil has the makings to become nature's next
trendy extract, for its therapeutic benefits, affordability,
versatility and increasing availability in American marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents tout the oil _ a natural topical antiseptic _ as
something of a cure-all for everything from acne, toe fungus, head
lice and gum disease to Legionnaires' disease and even germ-riddled
bathrooms. You can buy it in its pure oil form or in a dozen
hygiene products including soap, shampoo, acne lotion, dental
floss, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant and foot balms.
</P>
<P>
   Tea tree oil won over American consumers from the health food
and alternative medicine markets in the 1990s, but only recently
found shelf space with such ``mainstream'' retailers as nationwide
department stores and specialty chains.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Dean, an Australian plantation owner who has amassed 15
million tea trees on some 2,000 acres near New South Wales, opened
Tea Tree Therapy in Ventura three years ago to push the product in
the United States. (Her products are made stateside, but the trees
stay Down Under for the wet, humid climate and slightly volcanic
soil there.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here 10 years ago, very few people even knew what
it was,'' recalled Dean, a Santa Barbara resident whose Aussie
accent remains intact. ``Even few people in the health food
industry knew what it was. And only now do we see it moving into
the mainstream here in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend, she notes, is consistent with Americans' expanding
attitudes toward health and wellness options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it just takes a while for even a good thing to gain
notoriety,'' says Dr. Michelle Levan, who runs Capital Drugs
pharmacy in Sherman Oaks, a place where traditional pharmaceuticals
are sold alongside alternative medicines and aromatherapies.
</P>
<P>
   A more popular tea tree product, head lice shampoo, has its
highest sales when kids return to school every fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been selling this stuff for years and people swear by
it,'' said Levan. ``I think maybe we're seeing more (tea tree oil
products) now because of more competitive marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Australians have embraced tea tree oil for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Which shouldn't be too surprising, considering the paperbark tea
tree, Melaleuca alternifolia, thrives primarily in northeast
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines used tea tree oil for hundreds of years before
European settlers and scientists discovered its antiseptic uses in
the 1920s, after distilling it from the prunings of small, narrow
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government relied on tea tree oil so much during
World War II for treating soldiers' minor wounds, burns, head lice
and trenchfoot that it exempted tea tree growers, sellers and
plantation workers from serving in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting mainstream markets of Australia in the 1970s,
notes Dean, Tea Tree products today are as commonplace in
Australian drug and grocery stores as aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   It has a few other notable uses as a bathroom sanitizer, air
conditioning cleanser (to control the spread of Legionnaires'
disease, a contagious pneumonia) and pesticide to remove ticks and
leeches.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers like Dean would love to see the oil hit a similar
stride in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But although medical professionals recognize tea tree oil's
antiseptic benefits, they advise users to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, tea tree oil should not be swallowed, as it's
slightly toxic. In its pure form, it's best used topically on mild
infections after diluting it in mineral or olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, everyone has a one-in-five chance of being allergic to
Tea Tree Oil, warns Dr. Michael Hirt of the Center for Integrative
Medicine in Tarzana, which uses natural treatments with Eastern and
traditional Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been shown in clinical studies that 20 percent of
people can develop an allergic reaction,'' he said. ``That's
considered on the high side.''
</P>
<P>
   To test for allergic reactions, like a bad rash, he recommends
dabbing a drop on the forearm and letting it sit for three days.
``If the person develops a few small bumps there or a raised area,
at least they don't smear it all over their face and find out, that
way, that they're allergic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, Hirt says tea tree oil should not be used on anyone
with a ``serious'' infection or weakened immune system, such as a
person undergoing chemotherapy or with HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus).
</P>
<P>
   He also warns that using tea tree oil too often could reduce its
bacteria-killing powers with some individuals, as certain bacteria
can become resistant after frequent exposure.
</P>
<P>
   With those exceptions, Hirt says tea tree oil is an effective
treatment for conditions like mild skin infections or acne, and
less caustic to skin than other chemical antiseptics.
</P>
<P>
   And Levan, also a homeopathic practitioner, strongly advises
anyone undergoing homeopathic therapies to !ital!not use tea tree
oil, because its odor conflicts with homeopathic aromas. &QL;

A PARTY FOR HOSTESS ELLEN WRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 16)  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Martha Stewart a dozen years, a slew of books and a
lifetime of self-promotion to get the kind of attention Ellen
Wright has been showered with since her first book hit the stores
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Wright is a hostess in tony media circles who has written
``Bridgehampton Weekends'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.), a coffee-table
tome of recipes sprinkled with photos of Long Island idylls. For a
book party last Saturday at Wright's home on Mitchell's Lane in _
where else? _ Bridgehampton, the list of co-hosts barely fit on the
invitation. It included Mort Zuckerman; Don Hewitt; Alan C.
Greenberg, known as Ace, chairman of Bear Stearns; and Pete
Peterson, of the Blackstone Group, and his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney.
It was the fourth such party in Wright's honor. Tom Brokaw gave one
at his apartment in Manhattan, Vernon Jordan was host of another in
Washington, and Lew Wasserman, former chairman of MCA, had his own
in Los Angeles. Her friends have also helped her score guest spots
on ``Good Morning America'' and ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for someone who has spent so much of her life surrounded
by savvy media types, Wright, 60, seemed oddly ambivalent about
finding herself at the center of the fuss she helped create. As she
led a visitor on a tour of her 4,800-square-foot home, Wright
insisted it wasn't even her idea to line up her glittery friends as
co-hosts for the party. She said the publicist Peggy Siegal
convinced her that enlisting them would help generate buzz to sell
books. Blushing slightly, gray bob swinging gently, she conceded
that she had even been coaxed into hiring a hair-and-make-up person
for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really my kind of thing,'' she said, as guests,
ferried from their cars in golf carts, poured in. ``I really don't
know a lot of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the party got going around the pool, there wasn't much mixing
among Wright's old-guard media friends like Hewitt, Zuckerman and
Alan Patricof and Siegal's coterie of socialites, including Tiffany
Dubin, Vera Wang and Beth Rudin DeWoody. Each group mingled
expertly with its own, and the evening took on a well-practiced
air, a movable cocktail party vibe.
</P>
<P>
   Wright looked vaguely uneasy. Her usual style of entertaining is
to have six or eight friends over for dinner in the kitchen. ``I
like things to be cozy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that lack of pretension that makes Wright a popular
hostess. A sculptor and interior decorator who also worked as an
assistant to James Beard, she has been giving dinner parties since
the 1960s, when she arrived in New York after college in
California. Among her oldest pals are Pia Lindstrom and the
director Mark Rydell. Almost 30 years ago, she met Tom Brokaw, who
has ``practically lived in my kitchen'' ever since, she said,
adding, ``I just like to cook for friends of mine who happen to be
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, she married Mitch Rosenthal, the founder of
Phoenix House, the drug rehabilitation center. Her entertaining was
crucial to its fund raising, said Rosenthal, whom she divorced in
the early 1980s. One Passover her family Seder expanded at the last
minute to include James Beard, the actor Ben Gazzara and Bette
Midler.
</P>
<P>
   At the book party, the consensus was that Wright's finest
cocktail hour came last summer: a birthday hoedown, complete with
fried chicken and cornbread, for her present husband, Joe Wright, a
former Reagan administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends also agreed easily as to who was the worst square
dancer. ``Mort, definitely,'' Susan Patricof said, referring to
Zuckerman. ``He had a left-right problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright responded gently, as always. ``It was lovely to see
people loosen up,'' she said. ``That's what really makes things
fun.''

&HT;     LAWSUITS IN AIRLINE CRASH TO BE CONSOLIDATED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawsuits arising from the Jan. 31 crash of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 will be consolidated for pretrial
proceedings in San Francisco, a judicial panel in Washington, D.C.,
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The case is likely to raise sweeping questions about U.S.
aviation safety, lawyers for families of the victims say.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling made public Wednesday, a panel of seven federal
judges in Washington chose San Francisco over Seattle, Los Angeles
and other cities. It assigned the case to U.S. District Judge
Charles Legge.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who took part in arguments before the panel May 19 said
the choice of San Francisco turned on the fact that allegedly
improper maintenance dating from 1997 was done on the doomed
aircraft at an Alaska hangar in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Operations at the hangar have been the subject of a criminal
investigation by a federal grand jury in San Francisco since 1998.
There have been no indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, aircraft disaster litigation normally is
consolidated when lawsuits arising from the same incident are filed
in two or more federal jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said civil wrongful-death proceedings could begin within
weeks, but a trial or series of separate trials was at least eight
months off, assuming there was no group settlement out of court,
which was considered improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, including punitive
damages, are expected to be sought by hundreds of plaintiffs, the
families and estates of 88 passengers who died when the plane
crashed into the Pacific Ocean off Ventura County while flying from
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since Flight 261 was an international flight, the Warsaw
Convention of 1929 applies. The pact limits carriers' liability to
$75,000 unless willful misconduct by the airline can be proved.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, an accord between international carriers
greatly liberalized the legal situation for claimants. It said
airlines will not oppose claims up to $135,000 and there would be
no cap on damages shown to exceed that amount. The airlines,
however, may limit damages by showing they took ``all necessary
measures'' to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is going to expose a lot of major safety flaws in
the airline industry that have not been reported publicly,'' said
Niall McCarthy, a lawyer who represents the family of former San
Francisco police Officer Karl Karlson, who went down with the
McDonnell Douglas-made MD-83. The attorney accuses Alaska of taking
shortcuts in maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska spokesman said the legal development was mainly
procedural and had little or no bearing on the principal defendants
in the case, Alaska and Boeing, which acquired McDonnell Douglas
after the plane was delivered to Alaska in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's attorney, Mark Dombroff of Washington, D.C., declined
to comment. Dombroff, former head of aviation litigation with the
Justice Department, has defended airlines in several prominent
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 wrongful-death claims have been filed so far; six in
the San Francisco Bay Area, three in the Los Angeles area, three in
Chicago and one each in Spokane, Wash., and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said one lawsuit for each dead passenger could be filed
eventually, but they expected families of the five crew to settle
privately.

IN RUSSIA, A RAVE BEGINS WITH A MYSTICAL VOYAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By JOHN VAROLI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ From afar, lasers and strobe lights
could be seen bursting mutely from within the island fort, as if it
were being consumed by some mysterious battle, transforming it into
a radiant beacon amid the 3 a.m. twilight covering the Gulf of
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ferryboat loaded with young people docked after its
three-hour voyage, music pulsating from the turreted fort broke the
stillness. On the first weekend of July, as many as 10,000 Russian
youth laid siege to an abandoned and crumbling Czarist structure
some 30 miles off the coast of St. Petersburg for dancing,
performance art and general merriment during the season of northern
Russia's White Nights, when the sun sets for only three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since first visiting the fort three years ago, it has
been my obsession to stage a demonstration of modern and electronic
culture here,'' said Mikhail Barkhin, an artist who organized the
party along with several owners of St. Petersburg clubs, including
Decadence, Mama and Griboyedov. ``It's not only a beautiful
location, but a dramatic one. The whole event was meant to be an
artistic performance, not just a party, and part of the performance
was the long voyage to get there, which created the myth, the aura,
of voyaging afar to reach some wild destination''
</P>
<P>
   Wild it certainly was. The derelict fort, known by its nickname
Fort Chumnoi, or Fort Plague, was built 200 years ago to defend St.
Petersburg from invasion by sea, but early in the last century it
became a medical research center for bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-hour party featured DJs playing techno music on three of
the fort's four floors, as well as outside in the main courtyard.
There was also installation art and various performances, including
one man who repeatedly shot off a flamethrower from the second
floor over the heads of the crowd, which twisted hysterically amid
steel and brick debris on the square below. People peered from
behind broken walls and windows on each floor surrounding the
courtyard, and some danced on the roof as the first glimmers of day
appeared around 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Bosch painting come to life,'' said Sergei
Bugayev, one of Russia's leading conceptualist artists, who is
better known by his nickname, Africa. ``Many of the young people
take rave to be something close to religious ecstasy, and the
bizarre nature of the event is enhanced with the architectural
incongruency of a military site being used to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Yevgenie Yevdokimov, 27, who grew up in St. Petersburg but has
lived in Manhattan since 1996, said, ``I've never seen anything in
New York as wild as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Techno parties are not new in the former Soviet Union. They made
their way there about 10 years ago, part of the worldwide
dissemination of bass-heavy, thumping dance music. The music played
at the fort was in the best traditions of techno from America and
Europe. On each floor, various techno subgenres could be heard:
drum 'n' bass on one level, hardcore on another, and finally,
around 9 a.m. on Sunday morning, a wash of ambient sounds signaling
the time to chill out.
</P>
<P>
   The music might be much the same as elsewhere, but in Russia,
techno party locations are becoming ever more exotic. Last summer,
dances were held at an uncompleted nuclear power plant in the
Crimea, Ukraine, and in May there was one at the testing grounds of
the Institute of High Voltage in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, the island fort, under the control of the
Russian Ministry of Defense, was a top-secret location forbidden to
the public because of the nearby Kronstadt naval base. It took
Barkhin nearly all of the last three years to persuade naval
commanders to allow the party.
</P>
<P>
   Russians sometimes boast that their country is the freest in the
world, if not one of the most anarchic, where anything goes. That
is sometimes true, in part because of the absence of lawsuits in
Russian legal practice, which frees the organizers of events like
the island rave from worrying about liability for injuries. But
there is also something deeper, more specific to St. Petersburg
itself, that explains why thousands would endure a three-hour boat
ride to party on a chilly and remote island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this could only happen in St. Petersburg
because it is a city with a rich history and many ruins,'' said
Yura Nikitin, a Moscovite, as he stood on the roof of the fort and
surveyed the crumbling structure. ``People in St. Petersburg are
more crazy, gutsy and daring than in Moscow, where people are more
pretentious, money-conscious, and if something is just a little bit
uncomfortable, they go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most stylish things in Russia _ the whole music and dance
scene, for instance _ in large part come from St. Petersburg to
Moscow, which then develops them commercially and on a bigger
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Domnitch, a Web site designer from Manhattan who grew up
in Minsk, Belarus, said: ``It is becoming quite a tradition in
Russia to do these extreme parties because the people here are more
romantic and free. Westerners are more pragmatic, and worry more
about how much something will cost and whether or not there might
be a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The festivities started under an ominous sign. A last-minute
blackout _ the electricity for the party was provided by a nearby
naval vessel _ kept revelers waiting on the mainland, and the
crowds swelled to dangerous levels, forcing some to return home.
Once on the island, people climbed onto dangerous ledges on the
fort's roof. Organizers tried, often in vain, to rope off the most
threatening areas. Miraculously, there were no apparent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that in St. Petersburg we live in
darkness for most of the year, and then for a few months in the
summer go crazy during White Nights,'' Bugayev explained.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides music and dancing, the party featured art installations
by Ilya Voznesensky, who claims to be a great-grandson of Stalin.
His creations were white cloth faces, first designed on a computer,
then cut out of cotton and hung inside in front of the fort's open
windows. The brisk sea breeze blew the faces into three dimensions,
and with the sunrise at around 4 a.m., the light gave the faces a
ghostly appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to techno parties in France, but this one was
unbelievable,'' said Thierry Cabot, a French writer, the day after
the party. ``In France we might have such a party at a stadium and
get 20,000 people to party all night, but this ran all night and
day and was particularly impressive with the White Nights season.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone admired the goings-on in the gulf. ``The fort
party was not a good idea because it was dangerous and it
encourages the drug culture in Russia, which is already strong and
growing,'' said Katya Bokoutchava, 28, a journalist who covers the
St. Petersberg club scene and is friendly with the organizers. To
express her disapproval, she did not attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   Barkhin emphasized that his event was a noncommercial, private
affair. It was not advertised, and tickets were free, handed out
through a tight-knit group of people within the city's club scene.
He called the event a gathering of ``friends and like-minded people
who wanted to hang out and experience modern electronic culture,''
meaning techno music and computer-based art.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other techno parties, like this year's version of
the Crimean bash, will be commercially exploited, with ticket
sales, corporate sponsors and heavy press coverage. Barkhin said he
planned to resist such temptations, even if it meant never staging
another event at the fort. ``I don't want my events to go pop, and
so this will probably be the last type of event like this,'' he
said, staring into the distance over the water. ``But you can be
sure we will be back, and with something new.''

 &HT;    GLENN ASKS HIS TEACHING COMMISSION TO GET DOWN TO EARTH
 &HT;    370&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former astronaut John Glenn asked his national
commission Friday to come up with more down-to-earth suggestions on
how to improve the teaching of math and science in the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want our report to be a dust-catcher like other
reports,'' Glenn said. The retired U.S. senator was appointed one
year ago by Education Secretary Richard Riley to chair the National
Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a whole batch of specific suggestions,'' Glenn said at
the final public meeting of his 35-member blue-ribbon panel. ``List
the specific actions that parents, teachers, principals, school
boards can do, and that state school boards, higher education, the
state and federal governments should take.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke up after the members spent much of the morning
polishing the language of three major goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the supply, knowledge and skills of new math and
science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow down the movement of math and science teachers into
better-paying professions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give career teachers more time for professional development
and create about 10 new regional ``Glenn academies'' in which some
8,000 math and science teachers annually would help create and
duplicate model programs for their fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real over-arching goal is that we establish a system of
math and science education for all children that will be
competitive with the best in the world,'' said Alice Gill,
associate director of the issues department of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn paced from room to room as subcommittees brainstormed on
how to meet his demand for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, 'School boards should do X,' `` he told one group.
Another was told, ``Tell state legislatures to do Y.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James B. Hunt of North Carolina said he thought Glenn would
get what he wants before the commission issues its final report in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to find a way to stimulate the nation to take
bold action,'' Hunt said. ``Why don't we recommend a
man-on-the-moon type project _ except that we ought to do it in
three years, instead of a decade _ to get every math and science
teacher well-prepared to teach science and math?''
</P>

   Yet agreement on specifics was difficult for the members, who
range from prize-winning classroom teachers and lab-bench
scientists to technology titans, university presidents, governors
and federal officials of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   One business leader suggested telling states to require that
within five years, all math classes in middle and high schools must
be taught by people who had majored in math. A mathematician
replied that it would take more than five years to train that many
math teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher suggested increasing the mobility of math and science
teachers by having states recognize credentials from other states.
That won't be adopted by states that are afraid of having their
math and science teachers recruited by out-of-state school
districts, a governor quickly pointed out.

   The turmoil seemed very familiar to Bruce O. Boston, a
commission staff writer who worked for a similar commission in
1983. He recalled that its members chewed up and discarded eight
preliminary drafts of its report on ``A Nation at Risk'' before
agreeing on a final version, which warned that ``a rising tide of
mediocrity'' had engulfed American schools.

IS A HARDER LANDING IN THE WORKS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16.) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember stagflation? That's when the economy slows and
inflation rises _ the worst of both worlds. It was the curse of the
mid-1970s, as the economy fell into recession and the Consumer
Price Index rose 12.3 percent in a single year, 1974. And it
returned in 1980, when the CPI jumped 12.5 percent while the
economy ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has come way down since then, and the economy is now
in the longest period of continuous growth on record. So who's
talking about stagflation? Not many people _ and that may be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the few who are talking are not predicting anything like
the stagflation of yore. But they are saying that investors could
face a period of slowing economic growth, which they equate loosely
with stagnation, and of rising prices, which is inflation. They
warn that increases in unit labor costs associated with this more
benign stagflation will also cut into corporate earnings. But the
stock and bond markets have not yet factored this in; instead, Wall
Street forecasters still expect earnings to grow this year at the
quickest annual pace since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the worst, this small group of worried economists and
strategists adds, the Federal Reserve could raise short-term
interest rates higher than is now expected, in response to reports
of a climbing CPI. That extra tightening could push the the economy
into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen, especially when many Wall Street
strategists think that the Fed is guiding the economy to a soft
landing, slowing it down to a manageable but still positive pace?
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, a slowdown in economic growth would set off a
decline in the growth rate of worker productivity, measured by the
value of output for each hour worked. In the last two quarters of
1999, productivity surged, rising an annual rate of 5 percent and
6.9 percent, respectively. Unit labor costs declined during those
quarters, by 0.3 percent and 2.9 percent. Corporate earnings,
meanwhile, surged 22.7 percent and 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But with economic growth slowing, productivity gains will
shrink, said Paul A. McCulley, a portfolio manager at the Pacific
Investment Management Co., a bond powerhouse in Newport Beach,
Calif. That would happen because companies do not shed workers
quickly as demand for products slackens. Indeed, with workers so
difficult to find these days, few employers would be willing to
consider layoffs at the first sign of a slowdown. So the same
number of workers would be producing fewer goods, and that works
out to lower productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller productivity gains mean that unit labor costs, which
equal total worker compensation minus productivity, would rise. In
the first quarter of this year, productivity gains slowed to 2.4
percent while unit labor costs rose 1.6 percent, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. While corporate profits remained
strong, the CPI, not counting prices for food and energy, jumped at
a compound annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with rising unit labor costs, companies have two choices.
They can pass them on to consumers in higher prices, which adds to
inflationary pressures, or they can absorb them _ because of
competitive fears _ and reduce their profits.
</P>
<P>
   It is also likely that workers will be pushing for wage
increases to compensate them for the high productivity gains of the
last few years. Pay raises are usually backward-looking, because
they are based on profits the company has already made.
</P>
<P>
   McCulley says the period _ or ``interregnum'' _ of rising prices
and slowing growth should not last long, provided that the Fed does
not raise interest rates too much and cause a recession. On the far
side, an economy with inflation again in check and the Fed on hold
will be good for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the equity market has not embraced an
interregnum of stagflation.'' Equities, he said, are already
overpriced for the shock of rising inflation and slowing growth; if
the Fed tightens too much in response to an inflationary spurt, he
sees stocks headed for disaster.

EARNHARDT DRIVES TOWARD AN EIGHTH WINSTON CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAT ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt is having a resurgent season. It's not now or
never for Chevy's top warrior, but if he doesn't win a record
eighth Winston Cup championship now, he moves one step closer to
never.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, 49, is crawling up the rear bumper of points leader
Bobby Labonte. With a sixth-place finish at New Hampshire,
Earnhardt's 15th top-10 in 18 races, he chopped Labonte's lead to
45 points.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the dominant force he was during his prime, but
Earnhardt is one of the most respected drivers in Winston Cup
competition. He doesn't run up front as much as he once did, but he
has won once in 2000. His strength is to take advantage of other
people's mistakes and his own experience to record quality finishes
week in and week out. That kind of consistency earns Winston Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got four years of racing left, at least,'' said
Earnhardt, whose contract with car owner Richard Childress runs
through 2003. ``Who knows? I might even drive another car with my
own team. I'm not ruling anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt owns the two cars driven by his son, Dale Earnhardt
Jr., and Steve Park. Park has never had a breakthrough season and
suffers by comparison to the success young Earnhardt is having in
his rookie year. Park is signed through 2002 with an option year
after that, which coincides with the end of Earnhardt's contract
with Childress.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an Earnhardt in his mid-50s driving for his own team
would be a championship contender is problematic, which is why
Earnhardt is intent on taking advantage of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a job and an opportunity to win that eighth
championship,'' Earnhardt said. ``That's what we're focusing on.
That's what we're driving for. That's what we're working for. We're
doing it with a more solid team than I've had in past years. I
think our whole program has come together from last year to this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress' decision to have Kevin Hamlin become Earnhardt's crew
chief in mid-1998, moving Larry McReynolds from Earnhardt's car to
Mike Skinner's, has been a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is more my type and style of crew chief,'' Earnhardt
said. ``He's constantly thinking. He never quits on making it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said Hamlin reminds him of his former crew chief, Kirk
Shelmerdine. ``When I say something, he's already thinking it, and
that's the way Kirk was,'' Earnhardt said. ``We're thinking on the
same note. Our crew has been fine-tuned and moved around and
everybody really wants to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be with somebody who wants to win as badly as I want
to. I feel like that is the package we have this year,'' Earnhardt
said. ``We want to overcome.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KARMEL, West Bank _ Rafat, a skinny 9-year-old too shy to supply
a surname, heads every summer morning to the only swimming hole in
this hardscrabble stretch of the Hebron hills. It is a stark stone
cistern, about 100 feet long and 50 feet across, built long ago to
store the rains that fall only in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Descending a rickety ladder, Rafat and his pals plunge happily
into stagnant water barely 3 feet deep, its surface an unbroken
carpet of brilliant green algae.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our children,'' said Khalil Yunis, mayor of the
nearby town of Yatta, shaking his head at the sight of the small
boys diving under the undulating scum. ``And this is their water.''
</P>
<P>
   The algae-choked pool where Rafat swims is the centerpiece of
the village water system. The other daily water source for Karmel's
3,500 residents is a tiny spring-fed brook that wends its way
through a herd of goats into a newly covered concrete cistern.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers carry pails past a hand-lettered sign in English
and Arabic extolling this modest public-works project,
``implemented by Yatta municipality'' and financed by the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless America,'' Yunis said with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yunis tried to help Karmel further by linking the village to
Yatta's municipal water system, but the summer supply in Yatta is
so low that water now flows through the 3-inch pipe here ``just two
or three days a month,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the West Bank, Yatta gets its water from Israel's
state water company. Disputes over water resources have been a fact
of life here since the land was occupied by Israel 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators now trying to
resolve the issue of water rights, along with all their other
hypercharged disputes _ about refugees, borders, Jerusalem _ the
concern in this parched part of the West Bank is that Israel may
end up retaining its hold on the reserves beneath the bedrock here.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile down the dirt road, Yunis pointed out what is to
him a symbol of the conflict that he hopes the Camp David talks can
resolve: a pristine pumping terminal, protected by a chain-link and
barbed-wire cage, for a large water main supplying a Jewish
settlement town, Maon.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller pipe once channeled some of this water to Karmel, but
the link was severed by settlers, Yunis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is right here, and we can't touch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within plain view of the fenced-in pumping station, outside
another small village, Azam Abugadiah lowered two yellow pails into
a 30-foot well dug a year ago in another local-government effort to
expand water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Four times a day he expertly tips the buckets into the few
remaining inches of standing water, his family's only supply of
drinking water. Next to the nearly dry well, a new storage tank
stands empty, an electric pump is idle and the year-old water meter
shows a long row of zeros.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, water allocation is a zero-sum game, and
Palestinians consider local scarcity a direct and unjust
consequence of the resources given to Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   With their watered lawns and community pools, the 160,000 Jewish
settlers in the West Bank enjoy essentially the same suburban life
as Israelis elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlements, daily water consumption for households and
general urban use is about 774 gallons a person. That is not a lot
by American standards, but it is four times the Palestinian usage.
And during summer droughts, despite public-service calls to
conserve water, there is little real reduction in Israeli household
use. But among Palestinians, water supplies slow to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis make all this fuss about a shortage of water to
wash their cars, and we do not have enough to wash our bodies,''
said Muhammad Amro, an official with the Palestinian local
government ministry in the Hebron region.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says 26.5 gallons of potable water
per person is needed daily for minimal health and sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, where Palestinians control local
government but Israel still controls most of the water resources,
the average consumption is 18.5 gallons daily. In the summer in
towns like Yatta, with water systems connected to Israel's national
network, the supply dwindles to half that or less.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 215,000 Palestinians who live in villages with no
running water rely on trucked-in water bought in most cases from
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Lubell, a spokesman for Btselem, an Israeli human rights
group that brought European diplomats here for meetings with
officials of drought-stricken Palestinian towns, said the
settlements were just part of the problem. The drainage of aquifers
for Israeli industry and agriculture and the lack of serious
water-conservation efforts in Israel's affluent suburbs are the
real sources of the disparity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water issue is not one of the settlers vs. the
Palestinians, but of Israel vs. the Palestinians,'' said Lubell,
whose organization issued a study this month urging radical
cutbacks in Israel's use of underground fresh water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the inch-by-inch negotiating battle for territory here, the
lands that are bitterly disputed are precious and finite. But at
least they are not contracting. Subterranean water reserves, by
contrast, are steadily shrinking as the demands of two fast-growing
societies outpace natural replenishment by rivers and rainfall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As fresh water supplies diminish, brackish water from pools
deeper underground is drawn up into the depleted aquifers,
rendering the reserves undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israeli officials who favor increased allotments to the
Palestinians have argued for continued Israeli control of shared
aquifers beneath the hills here. Israel's acknowledged expertise in
water management can benefit both sides, they contend, and
hydraulics and topography make it easier to tap the main reservoir
from within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians point to Israel's recent warnings that it
may unilaterally cut water supplies promised to Jordan under the
terms of its peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The one point of concurrence between Israeli and Palestinian
water experts is that the aquifers do not hold enough water to
supply both populations at present consumption rates for many more
years.
</P>
<P>
   While Palestinian villagers import Israeli water in tanker
trucks, Israel is seriously considering the emergency importation
of Turkish water in tanker ships, converted for the purpose from
the oil trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli experts deride that proposal as costly and
unsanitary, and say the farms that use most of the country's fresh
water should instead be irrigated with brackish and recycled waste
water.
</P>
<P>
   The only long-term solution, experts agree, is to create more
fresh water. Israel is seeking bids for gas-powered desalting
plants along the Mediterranean. The water-deprived Gaza Strip could
be the biggest beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But in Karmel and other hamlets in the brown hills here, these
projects seem like a distant abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are discussing the problem of water for the next
generation,'' Amro said. ``But if we can't drink the water now,
there will be no next generation.''

LAWYER IN COKE CASE SEEKS SWEEPING CHANGE IN CORPORATE AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16.) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Cyrus Mehri, challenging the status quo is second nature.
His Iranian mother was punished in her youth for criticizing the
shah. Asked to do a book report in the seventh grade, he chose one
written by Abbie Hoffman. He cut his political teeth with Ralph
Nader, organizing communities to rise up around issues like
telephone rates. Even his birthday, July 14, coincides with a
revolutionary milestone, at least for the French.
</P>
<P>
   So when he filed a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Co. in
April 1999, representing four black employees who said they had
been denied raises, promotions and other advancement because of
their race, it was a fairly typical move for Mehri, who turned 39
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Coke mounted a vigorous defense, saying no discrimination had
occurred. But as the case continued into its second year,
investors, Wall Street analysts and others demanded that the
company resolve it quickly. After court-ordered mediation, the two
sides reached a tentative settlement last month, although no
details will be available until October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyrus is an excellent lawyer in the sense that he has a very
good big-picture feel for the dynamics of the process,'' said
Hunter Hughes, the federal mediator who oversaw the settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Mehri (pronounced ``merry'') parted company with
three of the plaintiffs, whose number had grown to eight earlier
this year. Along with a fourth plaintiff, they are now represented
by Willie E. Gary, a Florida personal-injury specialist who has
said that he can get more money for the employees than Mehri is
seeking. The split has created confusion among the estimated 2,000
current and former Coke employees who would be covered by the
settlement, and some have said they plan to opt out and file new
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In a minor victory for Mehri, Gary was ordered last week by the
judge, Richard W. Story of U.S. District Court in Atlanta, not to
solicit retainers or to invite the employees to meetings. ``I have
no problems with that,'' Gary said. ``We're not going to sign
anybody up until they have a chance to see this phantom
settlement.'' He has filed a discrimination lawsuit in Georgia
state court, asking for $1.5 billion in damages for four former
Coke employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri maintains that once the settlement terms are public,
plaintiffs and employees will be pleased. ``When the fog clears
this fall,'' he said, ``the narrow interests of a few will be
eclipsed by the movement of the many.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Coke was the first for his law firm, Mehri,
Malkin &AMP; Ross, which he opened in September 1998. ``People thought
I was crazy to risk the future of my firm on this case,'' Mehri
said. But he was confident that his case was solid.
</P>
<P>
   About six months earlier, he received a telephone call from
Linda Ingram, an information systems analyst at Coke, who felt that
the company had treated her unfairly. Ingram had obtained his phone
number from Bari-Ellen Roberts, a former financial analyst at
Texaco whom Mehri represented when she sued the company in 1994,
contending racial discrimination. The two sides reached a $176
million settlement that year.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who is now a diversity consultant in Stamford, Conn.,
said that Mehri kept close tabs on everyone involved in the Texaco
lawsuit, and that he stays in touch with her to this day. ``He was
like a guardian to us,'' she said. ``We had weekly phone calls that
lasted well into the night. When he was on his honeymoon, he was in
contact the whole time, except when he and his wife climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Coke lawsuit, Mehri, who says he believes that successful
class actions require a combination of hard work and lucky breaks,
received a mysterious package in the mail that turned out to be
Coke's human-resources database. Examining how black employees were
treated, he concluded that they were clustered in the lowest-paying
jobs; even in better jobs, they were often paid less than white
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jones, who organized a boycott of Coke products this
spring, praised Mehri for his courage in bringing the lawsuit. ``I
was embarrassed that no black attorneys were willing to stand up
and take on this lawsuit,'' Jones said. But he also said Mehri had
underestimated the anger of black Coke employees.
</P>
<P>
   Losing some of the plaintiffs to Gary, who is black, took Mehri
by surprise, Roberts added. ``He saw that race plays a part in
everything, whether we admit it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri, who lives in Washington with his wife, Robin Anne Floyd,
and their two young children, said every case was a learning
experience. ``We did Coke better than we handled Texaco,'' he said,
``and we'll do the next case better than we handled Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   There will always be another case. But Mehri's vision for
corporate America involves sweeping change, not the piecemeal kind.
He would like every company to file detailed pay-equity studies by
race and gender and what he calls a ``glass ceiling report card''
that would cover promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, no one is really going to look at their record, no
one is going to hold them accountable and no one is going to
enforce the law,'' he said. ``We can take the civil rights movement
to the next level, and level the playing field at the highest
reaches of these corporations. They let African-Americans in, but
they don't let them up.''

WHEN CHILD'S PLAY IS TOO SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as a society's ideas about nature can be read in
the character of its parks, and its beliefs about education are
often written in the look of its schools, the attitudes of
Americans toward children's play can be traced in the changing face
of public playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   They were there in the jungle gyms and asphalt that once
dominated playgrounds, and in the pyramids and mounds that
revolutionized play areas in the 1960s. And they can be seen now in
what some landscape architects and scholars of child development
see as contemporary playgrounds' deadening sameness.
</P>
<P>
   The style is ubiquitous: primary-colored, pipe-rail play units
moored in a moat of rubber matting, the number of moving parts held
to a minimum, sand and swings often banished, safety and low
maintenance elevated to pre-eminent concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Playgrounds are safer than ever, proponents say _ a critical
consideration when hundreds of thousands of children are reported
injured on playgrounds each year. But detractors say that many of
the playgrounds are dumbed down, that the pursuit of safety and
lawsuit-avoidance has eclipsed the goal of challenging play.
</P>
<P>
   Many implicate what M. Paul Friedberg, a landscape architect and
pioneering playground designer in the 1960s, calls ``safety
fundamentalism'' and what others say is a tendency of affluent
two-career parents to try to ``childproof the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is there is something wrong about the way we value
our children's development,'' said Roger Hart, the co-director of
the Children's Environments Research Group at the Graduate Center
of the City University of New York and a professor of environmental
and developmental psychology. ``We have a very narrow view of what
children need. We don't understand that play is important enough to
allow children to get dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Anthony Pellegrini, a professor of educational
psychology at the University of Minnesota, make the case that
American playgrounds are far better than they once were, even if
they are not as interesting as they might be.
</P>
<P>
   As Hart and others see it, play has many forms, all of them
valuable for development in the first seven or eight years of life.
In addition to physical activities like running, jumping, climbing
and swinging, they include such things as fantasy play,
social-dramatic play, sensory and exploratory play, and
construction play _ building with materials like sand, gravel,
water and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe a good playground, they describe something
that few Americans have probably encountered, a playground whose
diversity supports a wide range of activities, with such things as
holes to hide in, material and tools to build with, wagons for
hauling, flowing water that can be dammed, opportunities for
gardening, and a supervisor who can be consulted for help.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the adventure playgrounds that flourished in
Scandinavia and Europe after World War II, in which children built
play houses out of scrap materials, worked with tools and
experimented with timber, earth, water, even fire, under the
supervision of an adult leader. ``Better a broken bone than a
broken spirit,'' Lady Allen of Hurtwood, a leader of the movement
in Britain, is often quoted as having said.
</P>
<P>
   What children themselves prefer appears not to have been studied
extensively. But Joe L. Frost, a professor of early childhood
education at the University of Texas in Austin, says his research
shows that children are engaged longer, suffer fewer injuries and
have fewer behavior problems on playgrounds that are ``broad,
expansive and designed for all the developmental needs of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers gravitate naturally toward loose parts, stacking
materials, tricycles, sand and water, Frost said. Preschool
children need all that, along with apparatus to strengthen their
motor development. They all need exposure to nature. ``Children
need playgrounds that help them develop a sense of beauty,'' he
said. ``Some of them look like concentration camps.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, public playgrounds emerged in the late
19th and early 20th centuries, less out of an impulse to serve the
developmental needs of small children than out of a desire to keep
them off the streets and let them ``blow off steam,'' scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Central Park had no structured playgrounds until
well into the 20th century. The first one, the Heckscher
Playground, opened at the south end of the park in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael O. Gotkin, a landscape architect in New
York City who has written on the subject, playground building in
Central Park took off in the mid-1930s under the reform
administration of the parks commissioner, Robert Moses, amid rising
public concern for indigent families.
</P>
<P>
   By 1941, the Moses administration had built 20 fenced
playgrounds on the margins of the park and several deeper inside,
equipped with sandboxes, steel jungle gyms, swings, slides and
seesaws.
</P>
<P>
   In an article titled ``The Politics of Play,'' Gotkin quotes
Moses as having written that the playgrounds were ``surfaced with a
resilient asphalt preparation, which prevents digging and
eliminates dust.'' Moses also wrote, ``Located near the major
entrances, they intercept children on the way into the park and
provide a place in which excess energy can be worked off without
damage to the park surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park playground designs remained barely changed well
into the 1960s, Gotkin notes. Then in the late 1960s several
architects and landscape architects, including Friedberg and
Richard Dattner, applied the new ideas of child psychologists like
Jean Piaget and Bruno Bettelheim to the reinvention of playgrounds
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Working with materials like timber, concrete and granite, they
created playgrounds out of sculptured land forms, linking them with
such things as stepping columns and bridges, integrating the parts
into a single system of continuous play.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create equipment that could be used in many
ways, and to encourage decision-making and group play. Dattner's
Adventure Playground in Central Park became ``a must-see design for
sociologists, educators, designers and parents,'' Gotkin writes. As
the revolution spread, itinerant designers helped parents and
children design their own playgrounds in communities across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution proved short-lived. Through emergency-room data,
the newly formed federal Consumer Product Safety Commission
discovered during the 1970s that several hundred thousand young
children a year were injured at American playgrounds, many of them
in falls onto surfaces like Moses' resilient asphalt preparation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 the commission published its first set of
playground-safety guidelines. Then, at the request of playground
equipment manufacturers, the American Society for Testing and
Materials drew up its own voluntary standard for public playground
safety. Neither was mandatory, but they became the measure that
litigators used in court to judge a playground's safety.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frost and many others are convinced that the number of lawsuits
over playground safety has sharply increased, though no statistics
seem to exist. Frost said he had worked with more than 100 law
firms since the mid-1980s. Courts have awarded judgments of as much
as $11 million in recent playground-injury cases. He and others
contend that the fear of litigation has made municipalities,
manufacturers and some designers more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers now work hard to comply with standards and
guidelines,'' Frost said. ``And in doing so, they have to some
degree dumbed down their playground equipment.'' Many
manufacturers, he added, now avoid making certain types of
apparatus, like overhead ladders for swinging and fire poles for
sliding.
</P>
<P>
   Custom-designed playgrounds have dwindled in favor of
playgrounds with equipment selected from catalogs, designers say.
Municipalities with limited maintenance budgets have cut back on
sand and moving parts, which present a safety risk if not kept up.
Amid growing public fears about kidnapping during the 1980s,
parents began to prefer playgrounds with unobstructed views.
Tunnels were closed off.
</P>
<P>
   But while it may be difficult these days to build a challenging
playground that meets the safety guidelines, it is not impossible.
Take the 8-year-old playground at Nelson A. Rockefeller Park at
Battery Park City, known for its meandering wooden structures,
hiding spaces, child-powered merry-go-round, landscaped
surroundings, expanses of sand and a giant net suspended high above
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sweated blood on the whole job,'' said Donna Walcavage,
whose Brooklyn firm designed the playground. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission updated its guidelines after the working drawings
were complete, necessitating changes; few play-equipment companies
were willing to build the playground.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, she said, she was able to use sand, wood and
movable parts because Battery Park City officials wanted to create
something extraordinary and had the budget to maintain it.

   WACO-TRIAL (Houston) _ A jury decided on Friday that the
government does not bear responsibility for the deaths of 80 Branch
Davidians during the cult's 1993 standoff with federal agents. A
federal judge will take the ruling into account before delivering
the verdict himself sometime later. The five jurors deliberated for

   POLICE-TAPE-BEATINGS (Undated) _ In the nine years since George
Holliday, a plumber standing on the balcony of his Los Angeles
apartment, videotaped the vicious beating of Rodney King by police,
tapes made by onlookers have become a potent legal and political
tool. This week, with two more beatings by police videotaped by
news helicopters in Philadelphia and Lawrenceville, Ga., the images
are as powerful as ever _ even though, like most bystander videos,
they do not present a full or clear picture of precisely what
happened. That is usually the main issue when cases involving
videotaped evidence come to trial: defense lawyers argue, as they
did successfully in the first prosecution growing out of the Rodney
King beatings, that because the video recorded only the tail end of
the interaction, it leaves out the behavior that led to the
beating. By Tamar Lewin.

<P>
   ADAPAZARI, Turkey _ For Sevgi Pinarci and her family, the
scorching temperatures that swept Turkey and southeastern Europe
over the past 10 days amount to heaping insult on top of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since a devastating earthquake last August destroyed their home,
Pinarci, her husband and their two children have been living in a
tiny two-room makeshift shanty in a rubble-filled vacant lot. There
is no electricity, no running water and no relief from temperatures
inside the shack that have reached more than 120 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard for the children to sleep because even at
midnight it's like the hot sun at noon,'' said Pinarci, 38, as her
husband, Omer, 39, and two sons, Kaan, 13, and Bahadir, 9, looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the region eased somewhat Friday, but the
effects of the prolonged heat wave were still being felt from
Romania to southern Turkey. Crops, already suffering from a summer
drought, were damaged further. Water levels in reservoirs dipped,
threatening irrigation and hydroelectric plants. And firefighters
continued to battle wild fires on both sides of the Aegean Sea in
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the heat, with temperatures topping 100
degrees, the authorities in Romania and Bulgaria ordered trains to
stop running because they feared that tracks would buckle from the
heat. The only nuclear plant in Romania was temporarily shut down
after the temperature inside reached 158 degrees and set off
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Croatia were declared natural disaster areas as the
effects of the drought on crops was magnified by soaring
temperatures. Officials predicted crop production would be 40
percent to 70 percent lower than last year as a result of the
weather. Crops were also damaged in other countries, including
Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, high temperatures and strong winds helped to ignite
and spread more than 100 wildfires and led Prime Minister Costas
Simitis to order emergency services on maximum alert. ``Every
available force has been mobilized, and we hope we can bring the
situation under control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire temporarily threatened the ancient town of Corinth, 50
miles southwest of Athens, and other blazes cast a brownish pall
over the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The scorching heat has claimed at least 50 lives across
southeastern Europe and more than 20 in Turkey and sent hundreds of
people to hospitals. In Istanbul, the heat topped 110 degrees and
broke a 60-year-old record. In other parts of the country,
temperatures reached 130 degrees and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey ordered government
offices closed Thursday and Friday to lessen the danger to workers
and ease the drain on the country's electricity resources. In this
politically contentious country, even the prime minister's largess
could not escape criticism. Mehmet Yildirim, chairman of the
Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, told a local newspaper, ``If this
government was in Saudi Arabia it would declare all 365 days of the
year a vacation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Highways were so softened by the heat in parched central Turkey
that the Ministry of Public Works banned truck traffic during
daylight hours for two days because the vehicles were digging deep
gouges into the asphalt. Istanbul police were issued sunblock
lotion and sandals and permitted to take showers during short
breaks at the hottest times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But few showers were available for the tens of thousands of
Turks who have been living in prefabricated houses, tent cities and
shanty towns since the earthquake Aug. 17 that killed at least
17,000 people and left as many as 500,000 homeless. While the
government quickly rebuilt main highways, progress has been slow in
returning people to damaged homes or building new housing in
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman said there are 35 official tent cities,
housing about 30,000 people, throughout the region damaged by the
earthquake. But the officials figures do not count all of the
people who are still homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Adapazari, a city of about 180,000 some 100 miles
southeast of Istanbul, the Pinarcis are among seven or eight
families who have built ramshackle homes on a vacant lot not far
from their damaged homes. They bring in fresh water by bottle, cook
with propane tanks and wash their clothes in plastic tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Even as temperatures moderated and slipped below triple digits
Friday, the darkened bedroom of their two-room shanty was stifling,
and a hot wind blew a layer of dust across everything in the open
kitchen area. Sitting at a plastic table beneath an umbrella
outside the shack, Omer Pinarci complained that they had been
unable to join hundreds of other families in government-provided
prefabricated houses because local authorities said their house was
not damaged enough. But he said the house is unsafe and he refused
to allow his wife and children to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Winter was difficult, he said, but the last 10 days of heat were
even worse. ``The heat has been very bad, very bad,'' he said
mournfully.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voters are more disengaged in the presidential race
this year than at any time in recent history, according to an
extensive survey of American attitudes towards politics released
Friday by a non-partisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   Good economic times and a sense that there is little difference
between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush has lulled
voters into ``a rather pleasant sleep,'' said pollster Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The flagging voter interest could be an indication that turnout
this fall may sink to a new low, Kohut said. In 1996, only 49
percent of eligible citizens cast ballots, the first time in more
than 70 years that less than half of voters went to the polls to
elect a president.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew poll found that fewer than half of registered voters _
46 percent _ said they have thought a lot about the election, a
decline from 55 percent in 1996 and 63 percent in the same period
in 1992. The drop-off in voter interest and familiarity with the
candidates is especially pronounced in young and middle-age adults.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance that turnout will drop below the 1996
level, and ``it seems virtually certain,'' Kohut said, that it will
be lower than the 55 percent of voters who came to the polls in
1992, when Bill Clinton defeated incumbent George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, Americans said they are more satisfied with
their choice of presidential candidates this year, and they are
less critical of the way the campaigns are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, 73 percent expressed satisfaction with the
candidates compared to 49 percent in 1996, when former Sen. Bob
Dole won the GOP nomination to challenge President Clinton.
Sixty-six percent of Democrats said they were satisfied this year,
compared to 56 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The poll concluded that the race between Bush and Gore remains
wide open as the candidates head to the nominating conventions next
month. The survey found that likely voters are split between Gore
and Bush _ 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecided. Third-party
candidates Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan will not have much impact
on the race, Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly believe that the election of the
president is not as important as it was a decade or two ago, the
poll found. Nearly half of Americans _ 49 percent _ believe things
will pretty much stay the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey, conducted among 2,174 adults June 14-28 with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, mirrors
other recent polls which indicated that voters see little
differences in the two major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   This is despite their divergence on issues such as government
spending and social issues such as abortion and gun control and
whom each might pick to fill expected vacancies on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in play, but it would seem from our polling data
that American voters are dissatisfied, distracted or just don't
care,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar on government and the media at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found that fewer respondents are following news
about the campaign than did during the same period in 1996 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kohut also noted that the degree of voter interest could
change dramatically after the nominating conventions and if Gore
can energize Democratic and independent voters. He also said the
current voter disinterest could be due, in part, to the early
victories on Gore and Bush in the primaries that has created a lull
in media attention on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush enjoys an ``enthusiasm edge,'' with a greater proportion of
voters who described themselves as Republicans supporting him than
do Democrats who say they support Gore. Only 47 percent Democrats
said they strongly support Gore, compared with 56 percent of
Republicans who counted themselves as strong supporters of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, a slim majority of voters, no matter who they support,
said they believe Bush will win the election. Fifty-one percent
predicted that Bush will win, compared to 34 percent who said Gore
and 15 percent who said they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents ranked Bush higher on leadership abilities, while
giving Gore the edge on key issues important to voters, such as
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how fluid voters attitudes can be, the Pew
survey, conducted over a two-week period, detected a significant
shift in support from Gore. Between June 14-21, Gore led Bush 42
percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The following
week, amid news reports that a recommendation had been made for an
independent counsel to probe the vice president's 1996 campaign
finance activities, Gore fell to 35 percent compared to Bush's 42
percent, with 19 percent undecided.

and Bush _ 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecided. Third-party
candidates Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan will not have much impact
on the race, Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans increasingly believe that the election of the
president is not as important as it was a decade or two ago, the
poll found. Nearly half of Americans _ 49 percent _ believe things
will pretty much stay the same no matter who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey, conducted among 2,174 adults June 14-28 with a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, mirrors
other recent polls which indicated that voters see little
differences in the two major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   This is despite their divergence on issues such as government
spending and social issues such as abortion and gun control and
whom each might pick to fill expected vacancies on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in play, but it would seem from our polling data
that American voters are dissatisfied, distracted or just don't
care,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar on government and the media at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew survey found that fewer respondents are following news
about the campaign than did during the same period in 1996 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kohut also noted that the degree of voter interest could
change dramatically after the nominating conventions and if Gore
can energize Democratic and independent voters. He also said the
current voter disinterest could be due, in part, to the early
victories on Gore and Bush in the primaries that has created a lull
in media attention on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush enjoys an ``enthusiasm edge,'' with a greater proportion of
voters who described themselves as Republicans supporting him than
do Democrats who say they support Gore. Only 47 percent Democrats
said they strongly support Gore, compared with 56 percent of
Republicans who counted themselves as strong supporters of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, a slim majority of voters, no matter who they support,
said they believe Bush will win the election. Fifty-one percent
predicted that Bush will win, compared to 34 percent who said Gore
and 15 percent who said they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents ranked Bush higher on leadership abilities, while
giving Gore the edge on key issues important to voters, such as
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how fluid voters attitudes can be, the Pew
survey, conducted over a two-week period, detected a significant
shift in support from Gore. Between June 14-21, Gore led Bush 42
percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The following
week, amid news reports that a recommendation had been made for an
independent counsel to probe the vice president's 1996 campaign
finance activities, Gore fell to 35 percent compared to Bush's 42
percent, with 19 percent undecided.

&HT;     ANOTHER NEW TWIST IN MEXICAN POLITICS: JOB-SEEKERS MUST APPLY

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Help Wanted: Men and women to form new Mexican
government. Requirements: Love of Mexico, sense of social
responsibility, honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Days after he became president-elect of Mexico, Vicente Fox
dispatched headhunters to search for candidates who will shape the
new Cabinet before he takes office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect has shocked many traditional Mexicans with
his business-oriented method to government. But he has also
delighted others who would otherwise not have a shot to serve their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's approach is not the way the business of government has
traditionally been conducted under the 71-year rule of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which was
soundly defeated in the July 2 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Previous PRI governments consisted mostly of appointed friends
or relatives to those occupying the nation's highest posts,
sometimes without regard to qualification.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who ran under the banner of the pro-business,
conservative National Action Party, is not the run-of-the-mill
politician. The rancher who governed Guanajuato state was also
president of Coca-Cola in Mexico, and he is a whiz at successful
marketing in a country that slurps the soft drink like water.
</P>
<P>
   A believer of ``symbols,'' he marketed himself during the
campaign, wearing his cowboy boots, a huge belt buckle emblazoned
with ``Fox'' in silver, a blue shirt for his party's colors and a
trademark wave to supporters _ ``V'' for Vicente.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, a reserved
economist and veteran public servant, Fox had a swaggering image
that stood out with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this country needs is a rancher with guts, not an
intellectual,'' said office worker Martin Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzwords Fox uses to describe his future government are
``quality'' and ``clients.'' Under the Fox dogma, clients are
Mexican citizens and his government will be a quality product.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Fox issued a lofty, five-point standard, published in
newspapers, that must be met by applicants to work in his
administration. They must have: ``Love of Mexico, high sense of
responsibility, proven honesty, recognized capabilities and be able
to obtain results.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he is looking for men and women from all backgrounds
and differing political affiliations. When he governed Guanajuato
state, the top financial post went to a longtime PRI member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have commitments with no one, I don't appoint members of my
family. I don't bring teams I worked with on other projects,'' Fox
said this week in a late-night talk show on the TV Azteca network.
``The decisions I am going to make in the next two months will mark
the destiny of my six-year term.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would have his new government in place within two
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, headhunters are combing Mexico and are even
searching for Mexicans living in the United States to fill vital
jobs. Fox himself will conduct interviews and do the hiring of the
tops Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be assured that this Cabinet has two things:
experience, maturity, and, on the other hand, be like these yuppies
revolutionizing the world and making frog leaps to the process of
development,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dressed in basic black, her shoulder-length hair pulled back,
Lucy Villamar, 35, might fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations consultant, who has directed projects at
several museums, found out the name of one of the headhunters and
boldly gave him a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were surprised, but I was confident. I know there will be
a change because Fox said he would give opportunities to all
Mexicans,'' said Villamar, who wants to work with the Ministry of
Culture or a related post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique opportunity. I never would have had this chance
with the PRI because they put their friends in,'' added Villamar,
who said she voted for Fox. ``He said he would take into account
talent. Fox believes in women and the young. I see an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   While Villamar sees an opening, others are grumbling. This week,
the media had a field day, carping on Fox's headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governing a nation is not the same as selling Coca-Cola,''
Reforma newspaper columnist Rafael Segovia wrote on Friday.
``Putting an ad in a newspaper to obtain ministerial candidates
tells us a lot about Fox's concept in the art of governing. Like it
or not, it is the activity of an elite.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, 58, has already broken the Mexican presidential mold in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he the first opposition leader since the PRI was
founded in 1929, he will also be the nation's first divorced
president and the father of four adopted children. And he has an
Irish surname and a mother who was born in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thursday meeting with international news agencies, Fox
revealed his plans to appoint seven close advisers _ ``czars who
will demand results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be the czar of corruption, poverty, Indians, the
economy, education and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly won't spend much time in the office. I'll leave
the work to them,'' if he has a good team, Fox said, adding he
wants to travel throughout Mexico finding out what people want and
how government can help.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would meet once a week with his Cabinet to plan the
next week's work.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions Mexico, a poor nation bordering a powerful United
States, as Spain was after the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in
1975: a flagging economy surrounded by European giants.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of August, plans to travel to Washington to meet with
President Clinton. Among Fox's long-term goals is to make the
tightly guarded U.S.-Mexico border as open as the one between the
U.S. and Canada.

   STOCK-HOLDINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ It's the new risk for the

   FOOTNOTES-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Where Have All the Footnotes
Gone?'' the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay. At
that point, footnotes lucky enough to survive at all had moved to
the backs of books and turned into less scrutinized end notes.
Annotation was out; breezy, uninterrupted prose was in. Indeed the
Web has not only revived the footnote, it has spawned a
cross-referencing craze that renders the formerly complete media
event into a reference-laden, link-dependent, list-spewing
wallflower waiting to be courted by the next available annotator.

   WEBSITE-BOOK-REVIEWERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Book critics can be a
pompous, self-important lot. Many people gripe that they are out of
touch with the common reader and that their highfalutin academic
tastes have no relation to what the masses might enjoy. As with
every other aspect of modern life, the Internet _ specifically
Amazon.com _ has leveled the literary playing field. The Web site's
customers can review books and post their critiques, and thousands
of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated them to the
digital universe. By John D. Thomas.

   QUANTUM-PHYSICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Startling as life in the
subatomic realm can seem, with particles existing both here and

to take some small comfort in knowing that the ``real'' world
doesn't work that way. Though made of the very same stuff that
marches to the dictates of quantum theory _ the laws that explain
how particles behave _ solid objects obediently occupy one place at
a time and are never seen moving in two directions at once. But
when quantum rules are applied to the domain of creatures and
things, the result is nonsense. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ESTATE-TAX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The belief that anyone can grow
rich in America took root even before the colonies decided to
become a nation. This faith has outlasted innumerable depressions,
recessions, inflations and deflations, and today, with millionaires
now making up less than 4 percent of the population, it seems
stronger than ever. It's wise to keep this fiscal theology in mind
when trying to understand the push congressional Republicans are
making to repeal the estate tax _ and the unexpectedly wide support
they've garnered, both in Congress and among many Americans. By
Steven Greenhouse.

<P>
   GORE-THESIS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ah, the lessons learned in youth.
About love, faith, family and yes, the power of television to
define the modern presidency. This last issue weighed especially

in the topic he chose for his senior thesis for the history
department at Harvard in 1969. Its title: ``The Impact of
Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947-1969.'' The

current presidential campaign. By Peter Marks.

Communications Commission announced that it was going to consider

organizations across the country. In January of this year, William
Kennard, the commission's chairman, said he would proceed with the
plan and that the groups could begin applying for 1,000 licenses.

<HEADLINE>
IN JAPAN: OUTSOURCING WITHOUT A CAPITAL `O' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It's treated as a dirty little secret here, but Japan
Inc. is embracing, gingerly, one of America's most hard-knuckled
business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by a need to streamline their balance sheets, cut costs
and drastically upgrade their information technology to regain
competitiveness, Japanese companies are farming out chunks of their
computer operations to companies like IBM Japan, Fujitsu and NTT
Data.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Inc. is often choosing, however, to forgo one of the most
lucrative side effects of such outsourcing _ the shrinking of the
corporate work force and the resulting cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   As American as outsourcing may be, in Japan it reflects a
business culture stubbornly resistant to practices that sacrifice
employee well-being for the sake of efficiency. Japan's version
suggests, more broadly, why technologies and management practices
that are propelling the American economic boom have had less impact
here.
</P>
<P>
   When IBM Japan and Daiwa Bank put themselves on the map in 1997
with what was billed as Japan's first real outsourcing deal, the
treatment of the people involved was a bigger issue than the
business and financial ramifications. ``Given the unique character
of the Japanese employment system, there was some initial
resistance at the bank and perhaps within society itself,'' said
Yoshinobu Ishigaki, general manager of IBM Japan's service business
development division. ``Even the government showed some concern
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Daiwa deal spawned business that more than tripled
IBM Japan's outsourcing revenue. This year alone, IBM Japan, a
wholly owned subsidiary of International Business Machines, has
scored contracts worth more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a turning point in 1997 _ and it was a sharp one,''
Ishigaki said. ``Japanese companies realized they needed to
demonstrate their ability to change, and maybe more importantly,
Japanese society began accepting outsourcing.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants like Fujitsu and NEC are also using outsourcing _ both as
providers and as clients _ to meet the new challenges of a global
business world that is increasingly reliant on computers and the
Internet. Many businesses, particularly those in financial
services, realize that they can no longer afford to invest in
sophisticated information technology themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks in Chiba, Ehime, Hokkaido and lots of other places are
looking to outsourcing as a way to survive,'' said Fumio Ohue, the
partner who until recently headed the outsourcing business of
Andersen Consulting and is now chief operating officer of the
Netyear Group, a Japanese company that is devoted to providing
strategic consulting services online. ``It's hard for them to try
to catch up with new products, networks and business management
services on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing is a radical departure for most Japanese companies,
which have long taken pride in doing everything themselves, or at
least within their cluster of affiliated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sort of all-by-ourselves-ism that developed,''
said Sachio Nishiyama, chief manager of the systems administration
division at the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. ``Now we're
casting off that attitude, because we understand that there are
areas where other companies can simply do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of discussions among senior executives, Mitsubishi
Trust handed over to IBM Japan the operation of its data centers
and the management of networks linking its sales offices; the deal
is worth more than $350 million over the next decade. The bank
expects to cut the cost of systems administration by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The costs would have fallen further if Mitsubishi Trust had sent
the 50 employees associated with those activities to IBM Japan. But
all were offered jobs elsewhere in the bank, according to Masahumi
Abe, manager of the systems administration division.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S. and Europe, this is probably hard to understand,
since there, outsourcing is not just IBM Japan taking over the work
but also taking over the people,'' he said. ``But in Japan,
outsourcing hasn't reached such an extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly. In fact, only a few Japanese companies are
advertising their move toward outsourcing various aspects of their
business, including accounting and human resources. In this land of
lifetime employment, outsourcing conjures up an image of
job-cutting, which is still in many ways taboo. So most companies
would rather not talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, but why is The New York Times interested in our
outsourcing efforts?'' asked Fumiaki Ito, senior vice president of
the Meiji Seika Co., a candy, dairy and pharmaceuticals company
that hired IBM Japan in February to manage many of its computer
systems. ``We are not the only company adopting outsourcing, you
know. It's not such a big deal, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Katsuhiko Minami, director of Meiji Seika's information systems
department and manager of the 70 employees affected by the deal,
was quick to point out that only nine jobs were lost _ and that
those workers were given other posts or allowed to retire. ``There
are always new needs within the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining workers would seem to defeat the purpose of
outsourcing. But Minami appeared happy with the 100 million yen, or
$943,000, that Meiji Seika would save each year for the five years
of its contract with IBM Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot on a percentage basis,'' he said, ``but it's a
lot of money saved nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, however, such sensitivities are fading fast.
A recent television documentary about NEC's efforts to overhaul
itself showed four workers wrestling computers into shipping boxes,
tears streaming down their faces. They were part of a group of 300
white-collar employees, all formerly parked behind desks, who were
dispatched to a packaging and warehousing company affiliated with
NEC.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for NEC made no effort to explain away the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard the case shown on TV as outsourcing,'' he said,
bluntly declining to use more euphemistic terms for the
longstanding practice of sending unnecessary workers to affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Others work harder to make outsourcing difficult to distinguish
from more traditional business practices here. Ohue classifies many
recently created joint ventures as outsourcing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Toyo Information Systems, an affiliate of
Sanwa Bank, and Komatsu, the struggling general building
contractor. As part of a reorganization, Komatsu sold 65 percent of
its software subsidiary, Komatsu Soft, to Toyo. Komatsu can
continue to rely on its former subsidiary and, as a major
shareholder, still be treated as a special customer. Yet it shed
responsibility for some 700 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is win-win outsourcing done in a very Japanese way,''
Ohue said. ``I think we'll see more of that kind of outsourcing
because it allows everyone to save face and is not as harsh as
outsourcing U.S. style.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing still faces opposition here, no matter how soft the
touch. NCR Japan has been one of the biggest outsourcers, moving
1,200 people off its payroll and fighting at least one bitter
battle with labor. In 1994, the company temporarily transferred 700
employees to a new, partly owned affiliate to handle maintenance
work. Four years later, when NCR tried to make those transfers
permanent, some union members took the company to court. The case
is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   That has not discouraged Isao Aoki, head of NCR Japan's human
resources operations. ``I introduced outsourcing to this company
because I believe it will strengthen the whole company,'' he said.
``It was the only effective way to restructure in Japan, where
simply cutting jobs is considered unjustifiable.''

WHY GREENSPAN WILL SPEAK NO EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16.) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan gave two speeches last week. He was unusually
talkative. He declaimed at length about financial crises,
productivity, job training, education. But in all those hundreds of
words, not one dealt with the current condition of the long
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   That is understandable. Talking about the expansion at this
particular moment could get him or the economy, or both, into
trouble. Wall Street hangs on his words, ready to send stock prices
soaring if he signals that the Federal Reserve no longer needs to
raise interest rates; the bubble that had seemed to subside would
balloon again. Or he could warn about inflation, suggesting that it
might accelerate because scarce workers are demanding, and getting,
higher pay. The implicit solution: Let unemployment rise _ in an
election year _ to tame the workers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder his speeches dwell on easier themes. He puts off
assessing the economy until he can put it off no longer. That
moment will come on Thursday when, as Fed chairman, he testifies
before Congress on the state of the economy. The trick will be to
explain what is happening without having the explanation change
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan will almost certainly note that the economy slowed in
the second quarter from its blistering winter pace. He has no
choice: The statistics are fairly convincing. The argument that saw
the Fed through six interest-rate increases over the past year is
temporarily unavailable. The economy no longer appears to be
growing so rapidly that the demand for goods and services exceeds
the supply, threatening faster inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean that the Fed is done raising rates? Is
further slowing no longer necessary? Greenspan certainly does not
want to leave that impression.
</P>
<P>
   Just as rate increases or the threat of them tend to inhibit
stock market investors _ for myriad reasons, not all of them
rational _ the suggestion that rates won't rise tends to produce
exuberance. Stock prices could climb after months of moving
sideways. Demand and spending would then grow as stock portfolios
fattened and consumers felt flush again _ a sequence called the
wealth effect. And the economy's growth rate would rebound to what
the Fed considers an inflationary level.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe things have changed, and the old exuberance can no longer
be summoned so easily. ``The tone of the marketplace is a lot more
subdued than it was six months ago,'' said Albert Wojnilower, a
Wall Street economist. But soaring stock prices and a revived
wealth effect remain dangers that are likely to prevent Greenspan
from declaring that the economy has slowed enough.
</P>
<P>
   So he will almost certainly lace his assessment with caveats and
ambiguity. After all, the growth rate cooled in the second quarter
of 1999, only to turn torrid over the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, not all of today's statistics portray a slowdown.
Some, including the retail sales report on Friday, suggest
unexpected strength. Loan rates still encourage borrowing. And the
data is still coming in for June, not to mention July. Who knows
what those numbers will tell the Fed before its next policy
meeting, on Aug. 22?
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensible thing for Mr. Greenspan to say is that there have
been scattered signs that economic growth is moderating, but they
are far from convincing,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. ``That is our view, and that
leaves the door wide open for him to do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Wojnilower adds a note: ``He could mention that the stock market
has stopped adding wealth, and in that way give the message that if
the stock market adds to wealth again, the slowdown might not
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a second aspect of inflation that Greenspan will almost
certainly address. Apart from the oil shock, prices have been
gradually rising this year, and some at the Fed think that
inflation could continue to edge upward even if a slowdown
persists. The concern is that low unemployment drives up wages and,
in turn, prices.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened yet, despite many months of low
unemployment. Some economists now declare the wage-price linkage
broken, or effective only at an unemployment rate below today's 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan himself is a doubter. He speaks much more often about
improvements in productivity, in effect giving employers more
revenue to pay for raises without raising prices. But in deference
to a Fed tradition of linking wage increases and price increases,
he is likely to mention the potential inflationary danger of a
prolonged labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he will suggest a higher unemployment rate, or a
crackdown on raises. Not in a Senate hearing room full of
politicians three months before the election.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Faith, hope and federal money
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed a $400 million increase in federal aid
for after-school programs today, and said religious institutions
should be permitted to qualify for both current funding and the new
money as well. ``We shouldn't fear faith and love,'' he said at a
Presbyterian community center in Elizabeth, N.J. Bush said he
favors ``combining compassion and love with federal money.'' Bush's
appearance was designed to underscore his campaign theme of
compassionate conservatism with the theme: no child left behind.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT, WHAT ABOUT THE METS?
</P>
<P>
   From New Jersey, George W. Bush crossed the Hudson River today
and mocked Hillary Clinton's bid to depict herself as a New Yorker
and said her rival for the Senate, Rick Lazio, ``doesn't have to
wear a Yankee cap to play like he's a Yankee fan.'' Bush and Lazio
spoke to the same Conservative Party luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING _ BUT WHEN?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is strongly considering plans to announce his running
mate the day after the Republican convention ends early next month,
as a way of siphoning media attention from the Republican
candidate, George W. Bush, according to the New York Times. The
paper, quoting sources, said that Gore has not yet agreed. He may
want to allow some time to pass after the GOP convention ends to
gauge the public's response to the Republican ticket. And he may
also need extra time to determine whether he wants to counter the
Republican choice in terms of gender or geography.
</P>
<P>
   COULD IT BE GEPHARDT . . .
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is exploring the possibility of picking House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri as his running mate in a move that
would unite two of the most powerful figures in the Democratic
Party, according to several news organizations. Although talks are
at an early stage _ and could well go nowhere _ just the floating
of a Gephardt trial balloon has set off a sharp debate within the
Democratic establishment over the pluses and minuses of picking the
highest-ranking House Democrat. Gore held a secret meeting with
Gephardt last Saturday, and is not known to have had face-to-face
veepstakes discussions with anyone else under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   . . . OR COULD IT BE GRAHAM?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida is going to Nashville on Saturday,
and it's not to be a backup singer on Faith Hill's next album. He's
vying to be Al Gore's backup. Speculation surrounding Graham as a
potential running-mate intensified this week when Gore asked
Graham, who also is a popular Florida ex-governor, to fill in for
him at a Tennessee fund-raising event. It will be the second time
in as many weeks that Graham has filled in for Gore, another clear
sign that Graham is on a shortlist of running mate choices.
</P>
<P>
   HAIL THE DEFEATED CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will keep a schedule fit for a nominee at the
Republican convention, seeking the spotlight even as George W. Bush
claims the Arizona senator's delegates and the GOP presidential
nomination. McCain's tentative schedule includes one news
conference, three speeches, dozens of media interviews and a bus
trip. With an eye on a second presidential race, the Arizona
senator will promote himself and his reform agenda at the July
31-Aug. 3 convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   LOW PROFILE FOR LITTLE BROTHER
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he has remained mostly out of sight
during the presidential campaign because he is worried that a
higher national profile could hurt brother George W.'s campaign.
``I've really been almost reclusive,'' said Jeb Bush in an
interview with the New York Times. ``I don't see how I help George
by having a high profile nationally. In fact, I see the opposite.''
Jeb has done relatively little campaigning for his brother outside
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters President James Hoffa not only will attend this
month's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, he'll be
honored there at a party thrown by GOP chairman Jim Nicholson and
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. This apparently will be the first time
in 20 years that a union president has been honored by the GOP
during one of its conventions. The Teamsters' endorsement in the
presidential race is eagerly being sought by both the parties. The
union, with its 1.5 million members, has not endorsed a candidate
yet.
</P>
<P>
   NEW BUSH TV ADS TO TRACK GORE'S
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, which suspended its TV ad campaign three
weeks ago, is returning to the airwaves in force in an effort to
help their flag-bearer build momentum before his nominating
convention. An ad touting plans by George W. Bush and the party to
improve education will begin airing Tuesday in the 17 states
currently running Democratic National Committee ads on behalf of Al
Gore. In addition, Republican ads will air in California, Nevada
and New Hampshire. The new buy, about $6 million in the first week
alone, underscores Bush's intention to compete with Gore in
traditionally Democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TRASH THEIR TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Texans unhappy about their state being the target of political
broadsides by the Gore presidential campaign have formed an
organization to counter the attacks on health care, education and
other issues. The Proud of Texas Committee described itself in a
letter to Al Gore as a group of independents and Democrats who plan
to speak out against incorrect or misleading information about the
Lone Star state. Gore has criticized Texas' record under the George
W. Bush's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIT OK'D ON BUCHANAN'S LIST
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party leaders have cleared the way for Pat Buchanan's
opponents to force an audit of his massive list of supporters,
arguing that the list may taint the party's presidential selection
process. John Hagelin, the little-known physicist challenging
Buchanan for the Reform nomination, says he wants to know whether
the former Republican fattened his petition numbers with names from
his extensive list of Republican supporters. The auditor would be
required to keep the names on the list secret.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MANY, YOU CAN WAKE THEM WHEN IT'S OVER
</P>
<P>
   State polls show Al Gore ahead in California and New York, but
behind George W. Bush in Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois, with
Ralph Nader taking support from Gore in several states. The race in
Florida was close after Bush led there in April, the poll
suggested. A national poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press (3 percentage point margin of error) suggested
less interest than in past presidential elections, with less than
half saying they thought a lot about the election, a drop from
two-thirds who were closely following the campaign in the summer of
1992.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MAKEUP NEEDED BEFORE THE CLOSE-UP
</P>
<P>
   It's not the spruced-up image this convention city was hoping
for. It was supposed to be American flags and a red, white and blue
skyline in honor of the Republican National Convention, not a
videotaped police beating of a black suspect after a stolen car
chase and shootout. The incident is a reminder of Philadelphia's
unpleasant past, marked by police brutality, corruption, racism and
a deadly fire-bombing. Police Commissioner John Timoney says a
single incident, however the investigation turns out, should not
taint the country's image of the city. But the videotape will have
an impact.
</P>
<P>
   THE CITY OF BROTHERLY PROTESTS
</P>
<P>
   From T-shirts and fliers with the convicted man's face to a day
dubbed the ``Executioner's Ball,'' supporters of death row inmate
Mumia Abu-Jamal are expected to be particularly visible in the sea
of activists during the Republican convention. So visible that
other demonstrators worry about over-saturation, though some of
Abu-Jamal supporters say there can't be too much attention.
Abu-Jamal, 45, is the ex-radio journalist and Black Panther who was
sentenced to death in the 1981 killing of white Philadelphia police
officer Daniel Faulkner. Abu-Jamal's supporters say he was framed
by racist police.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE THE SUPER BOWL SIDESHOWS
</P>
<P>
   For political junkies, there will be a home away from the
Republican convention: PoliticalFest, a multimedia show, that will
try to capture some of the history and hoopla of the nation's
political conventions. PoliticalFest is set for the cavernous
Pennsylvania Convention Center from July 26-Aug. 3. Visitors will
be able to deliver a whistle-stop speech, tour replicas of the Oval
Office and Air Force One, explore items on loan from 10
presidential libraries, and otherwise immerse themselves in
American political history. The event was dreamed up a few years
ago as a way to distinguish Philadelphia from other convention
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   MIRROR IMAGE OF 1988
</P>
<P>
   He's a popular governor, has no foreign policy experience, is
running against a sitting vice president and enjoys a comfortable
midsummer lead against his opponent. Who is he? If this question
were posed on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' the most obvious
answer would be George W. Bush. But the description also fits
Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee against another George
Bush. The similarities are eerie: a strong economy as the campaign
backdrop; an administration marred by major scandal; a vice
president struggling to move out of the shadow of a star-quality
president; a Democratic candidate criticized for not connecting
with the voters. And a man named Bush.
</P>
<P>
   FACING HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis, today a college professor, has had plenty of
time to reflect on a campaign that started with high expectations
but went down to dismal defeat. ``The first thing you ought to
learn from 1988 is that the horse race numbers are meaningless,''
he said, pointing to the polls in the summer of 1988. ``Those
numbers were never real, and they never are.'' In mid-June of that
year, Dukakis led Vice President George Bush by a 14-point margin.
The day after the Democratic convention ended in Atlanta, Dukakis
was ahead by 17 points. He ultimately lost the election 53 percent
to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S OFFICIAL _ NBC BACKING AWAY
</P>
<P>
   NBC News released coverage plans for the conventions that could
push President Clinton's speech at the Democratic event off the NBC
broadcast network and instead relegate it to the less widely
available cable channel MSNBC. MSNBC will extensively cover each
four-day convention, but the NBC network _ making official what it
earlier hinted at _ said it will limit live coverage to just one
hour on the Wednesday of each convention and 90 minutes on the two
Thursdays, when nominee acceptance speeches are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN A KISS IS A HANDSHAKE
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign swing through Queens, Hillary Clinton offered her
most detailed explanation yet about why she kissed Suha Arafat,
wife of Yasser Arafat, after Arafat made scathing remarks about
Israel during a joint appearance in November. Responding to a
woman's question at the Bell Park Jewish Center: ``I don't know if
any of you have been to the Middle East. But if you have, you know
that a kiss is a handshake. ... I did what I was expected to do.''
She added that she had ``responded appropriately as the first lady
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO ARE THESE GUYS, ANYWAY?
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jim Talent has taken a 41-36 lead over Democrat Bob
Holden in what has been a largely invisible campaign for Missouri
governor. Perhaps the most significant finding in the poll
commissioned by the Kansas City Star was the relatively low name
recognition for both. Holden, the state treasurer, ran successful
statewide campaigns in 1992 and 1996, yet more than one in four of
those surveyed said they did not recognize his name. Talent has
been a congressman from St. Louis County for eight years, but
nearly one of every five people surveyed said they didn't recognize
his name.

 &HT;    Balloon team holds 40-year reunion
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon in 1969 and
called it ``one small step for a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kittinger stepped into thin air on Aug. 16, 1960, and nobody
could call it small.
</P>
<P>
   Kittinger's step set a world record that still stands for the
world's highest parachute jump _102,800 feet. He had floated to the
edge of space in a helium-filled balloon as part of the Air Force's
early high-altitude flight experiments, before America sent its
first astronauts into space.
</P>
<P>
   Kittinger relived those pioneering years Thursday with about 20
other members of the balloon research team at the Air Force Museum,
where the recently restored gondola from his record-setting flight
is on display.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion marked the 40th anniversary of the flight, which was
known as Excelsior III.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first time we've all gotten together,''
Kittinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The team decided to mark the anniversary this weekend because
Kittinger was in town to attend the National Aviation Hall of
Fame's weekend enshrinement ceremonies. Kittinger was inducted into
the hall of fame in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although the balloon flights were made from Holloman Air Force
Base, N.M., the research projects were managed at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, where Kittinger was stationed as an Air Force
officer from 1958 to 1963. Kittinger now lives in Orlando, Fla.,
but he said most of the people he worked with still live in the
Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   The gondola, parachute and other equipment designed specifically
for the flight were made on the base, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything for that project, except for the balloon, was done
right here in the shops at Wright Field,'' Kittinger said. ``The
Air Force had a tremendous capability, and it gave engineers a lot
of hands-on experience. We kept the civilian contractors honest
because we had the capability of doing it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittinger called it ``sad'' that the Air Force has closed its
shops at Wright-Pat and turned most of its research over to
contractors, but the tone of Thursday's reunion was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Kittinger recalled how Mad magazine once poked fun at his leap
by speculating on the fate of the photographer who snapped a famous
photo of Kittinger, clad in pressure suit and parachute pack,
leaping away from the gondola.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a civilian, and we didn't have a pressure suit for
him,'' Kittinger joked.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the camera that snapped the photo was set up by Tom
Arnold of Springfield, who was in charge of the cameras that
documented the flight and recorded data.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold recalled trying to make sure the cameras could work in
the extreme cold of the upper atmosphere, where temperatures fall
to minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough power (in the gondola) for heaters, so
we used hot water bottles,'' he said. Arnold warmed small plastic
water bottles in his car before the flight, then taped them to the
cameras before liftoff.

 &HT;    Settlement reached in Lexus suit
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Five people will receive free three-year leases
on luxury cars, the result of the Florida Attorney General's suit
prompted by a West Palm Beach Lexus dealer's questionable ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Attorney General in February sued Lexus of Palm
Beach, which is owned by Bob Cuillo. The state said the Okeechobee
Boulevard dealership lured customers with deceptive ads.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership and its Boca Raton ad agency, McGee &AMP; Starr, say
there was nothing wrong with the ads. Attorneys for both companies
said they settled to avoid a costly court battle.
</P>
<P>
   McGee &AMP; Starr agreed to pay for the free leases as part of an
out-of-court settlement approved by Broward County Circuit Judge
Charles Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to stand by their product,'' said Scott Richman,
an attorney for McGee &AMP; Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The agency created full-page ads that were published in The Palm
Beach Post in June 1999. In the ads, Lexus of Palm Beach offered
free cars if it couldn't match or lower customers' monthly
payments.
</P>
<P>
   One ad promised: ``No matter what you're trading in, no matter
what you're paying now, we will meet or beat your current monthly
payment or we'll give you the Lexus FOR FREE!''
</P>
<P>
   The dealership contended that the ads' disclaimers in small
print excused it from giving away cars.
</P>
<P>
   Two customers, Barbara Sherry of Boynton Beach and Mindy
Felinton, an attorney from Boynton Beach, were enticed by the ad.
In separate visits to Lexus of Palm Beach in June 1999, they tried
to trade their luxury cars for Lexus RX300s, a sports utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When the dealership didn't meet the terms of the ad, Sherry and
Felinton complained to the Attorney General's Office. The state
investigated and found two other car shoppers from Palm Beach
County and one from Broward County who also were lured by the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry and Felinton didn't return calls. Assistant Attorney
General Bob Buchner said the five customers signed confidentiality
agreements as part of the settlement. Those agreements prevent them
from discussing the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Buchner said the free three-year leases are worth about $15,000
each.

 &HT;    Robert Spano's Brooklyn hot list
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We asked Robert Spano, the new music director of the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra and the conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic
since 1996, his favorite things to do in the borough. Though Spano
maintains a home in Brooklyn Heights, his schedule doesn't permit
him to spend much time there _ hence his fondness for takeout. His
list:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Promenade. This 2/3-mile walkway overlooking the East
River offers a knockout view of Gotham and the Brooklyn Bridge and,
on clear days, a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty. Brooklyn
Heights, between Cranberry and Remsen streets.
</P>
<P>
   2. Junior's cheesecake. Junior's is a quintessential New York
deli. New York magazine has called its cheesecake ``the world's
finest.'' 386 Flatbush Ave., downtown. 718-852-5257. To order
cheesecake: 1-800-958-6467.
</P>
<P>
   3. Nanatori Japanese Restaurant. A fashionable sushi place that
offers takeout. 162 Montague St., Brooklyn Heights. 718-522-5555.
</P>
<P>
   4. Heights Chateau Wines. Laura Park, the Philharmonic's
concertmaster and Spano's roommate, jokingly reminded the conductor
that ``the booze shop on Atlantic Avenue'' is one of his favorite
spots, because _ you guessed it _ it delivers. 131 Atlantic Ave.
718-330-0963.

 &HT;    A Brooklyn state of mind: Manhattan's neighbor borough more than
holds its own, a beautiful bridge to America's melting-pot heritage
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, N.Y. _ Imagine spending your honeymoon here.
</P>
<P>
   My parents did, in 1947. But all my mom ever talked about was
the time she got her high heel caught in an escalator, and my dad
never could get over the tunnel guard who took one look at the
slowpokes with the Georgia license plate and yelled: ``Damn it, go
ahead!''
</P>
<P>
   How those Yankees laughed at their expense. My folks never made
it back, but they clung to their Brooklyn stories.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a lifetime of studiously avoiding the place in favor
of the Big Apple _ the mother of all boroughs and one of the most
intensely cosmopolitan cities on Earth _ I've gotten jazzed about
Brooklyn myself.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Manhattan glam when you've got BAM (the Brooklyn
Academy of Music and home of such trendsetting artists as Mark
Morris, Laurie Anderson and Robert Spano, the newly appointed music
director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra)? Who needs Dorothy
Parker and The New Yorker's vicious circle when you can wander
among houses where Walt Whitman, Arthur Miller, Truman Capote,
Carson McCullers and Thomas Wolfe once wrote? Who needs a skinny
island cramped with skyscrapers when you've got Brooklyn's 3 1/2
centuries of history, architecture and that fabulous bridge? And
who needs Carnegie Deli or Katz's when you've got Junior's, an
orange-vinyl, downtown monstrosity that dishes out 59 kinds of
sandwiches and arguably the world's best cheesecake?
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Brooklyn-born comic Henny Youngman, take Manhattan
_ please. It's Brooklyn, birthplace of the hot dog and the Dodgers,
George Gershwin and Woody Allen, Mae West and Barbra Streisand,
that gets my vote as a truly great American place.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around one misty Sunday morning, crossing the scroll of
history that's the Brookyn Bridge, seeing Gotham through its Gothic
arches and watching the ferries cross the East River, I got an
altogether different view of this urban landscape. The towers and
steeples of lower Manhattan (Chemical Bank, Trinity Church, the
World Trade Center) were lined up like upended lipstick tubes
shrouded in murky blue ether. As joggers in Nikes and Yankees caps
slushed across the 117-year-old bridge, historical markers reminded
me that I was standing on a monumental feat of engineering, where
cable cars, electric trolleys, elevated trains _ even stagecoaches
_ have left the etchings of Time and Invention. Stagecoaches? Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Down under the bridge, I stuck my head into the River Cafe,
where urns of pussy willow and banks of potted azaleas, hydrangeas
and daffodils announced a scene that is one of the most romantic in
the city. This restaurant is so in demand as a setting for marriage
proposals that the pastry chef has fashioned a chocolate
ring-holder. As I stood swooning, a man who looked like he was late
for work scooted through the parking lot and mocked the sound of
the blaring foghorn: ``Booooooonk! Boooooonk!'' Street scat.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing my morning constitutional, I strolled through one of
the oldest parts of Brooklyn, the Fulton Ferry Historic District,
so named for the steam ferries that began regular service to and
from Manhattan in 1814. By the mid-19th century, tens of thousands
of commuters made the trip daily. And Brooklyn _ or Breukelen, as
the original Dutch settlers of 1635 called it _ became New York's
first suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The view of city, water and sky from this vantage point was a
gas, and it was particularly moving to see that lines from Walt
Whitman's ``Crossing Brooklyn Ferry'' had been scripted into the
metal railings of the esplanade. (Nearby, at 170 Fulton St.,
Whitman, editor of the Brooklyn Eagle in 1846-47, set the type for
``Leaves of Grass,'' published in 1856.) ``Stand up, tall masts of
Manhattan! Stand up, beautiful Hills of Brooklyn! Throb, baffled
and curious brain!'' read the Whitman lines, making me feel at one
with the past and my present state of mind. Which meant it could
only be time for one thing: Junior's.
</P>
<P>
   Over this recent long weekend, I had hoofed my way around
Brooklyn's trendiest neighborhoods, from Brooklyn Heights to Park
Slope. I had hopped from BAM to BMA (Brooklyn Museum of Art) to the
BBG (Brooklyn Botanic Garden). But it wasn't until I got to
Junior's that I began to understand the melting-pot beauty of this
borough, where Hassids and homeboys all come together to say
yous-guys. While a James Dean type in a white T-shirt drank a glass
of milk, an African-American family noshed on cheesecake. And I
ordered matzoh ball soup and salmon croquettes.
</P>
<P>
   For Brooklyn is nothing if not the accumulated wealth of its
Italian, Jewish, African-American, West Indian, Asian and Latino
populations. It is home to 2.3 million people, representing 150
racial, ethnic and religious groups, according to its tourism
council. And _ here's where I drop my matzoh ball _ one in seven
Americans has roots in Brooklyn. This explains why my parents came
here on their first big trip out of the South _ to visit my Uncle
Gus and Aunt Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   After a fashion, Brooklyn is the Northeastern equivalent of New
Orleans _ a polyglot culture where anything can happen. And usually
does.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask my mom about her honeymoon.

 &HT;    Boroughing through Brooklyn: The highlights
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, N.Y. _ Next to glitzy Manhattan, Brooklyn has often
seemed stuck in the shadows _ like an old aunt's frowzy walk-up or
those leftovers that keep getting pushed to the back of the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of Brooklyn, I think of my grandparents'
apartment with plastic on the furniture and the smell of pasta
sauce lingering in the hall,'' says Stacey Colosa Lucas, the
Georgia Shakespeare Festival's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, that's pretty much been everybody else's notion,
too. Though Brooklyn Heights has long been one of Manhattan's most
desirable burbs, look beyond its ``Moonstruck'' view and you'll
find yourself deep in the gritty heart of East Coast America. From
one subway stop to the next, the moods of Brooklyn can careen from
Spike Lee's Bedford-Stuyvesant to Neil Simon's Brighton Beach, aka
Little Odessa. If Manhattan is a platinum-blond starlet, Brooklyn's
a babushka.
</P>
<P>
   But that's been changing of late.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to 30 years of adventurous programming, BAM _ the moniker
of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, America's oldest performing arts
center, which opened in 1861 _ has become a cultural flashpoint in
the heart of the city. As evidence, the Daily News recently
reported that more than 25 Manhattan dance and theater companies,
smelling cheaper rents, were moving to the borough. At the same
time, The New York Times inked mammoth spreads on the flourishing
club and restaurant scene that's sweeping Fort Greene, Smith
Street, Park Slope and even bombed-out-looking Williamsburg.
Suddenly, it seems that Brooklyn's the hippest across-the-river
bohemian hangout since the Left Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brooklyn's transformation to the ground zero of cool
has been so sudden that guest accommodations can't keep up with
demand. The downtown Marriott, which in 1998 became the first hotel
to open in 60 years, is already planning to expand. To fill the
void, Brooklyn Tourism Council spokeswoman JoAnne Meyers says there
are nearly a dozen bed-and-breakfasts and a service called Homestay
New York (information: 718-434-2071) that places visitors with
families that share similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   Over a recent long weekend, I had no trouble finding a place to
stay, checking in first at Park Slope's cozy but expensive Bed &AMP;
Breakfast on the Park, a 20-minute walk from the Brooklyn Museum of
Art and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden _ two warhorse institutions
that are worth a trip on their own. For a more urban experience, I
later moved to the Marriott, just a couple of blocks from the
Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, I found Brooklyn to be an ideal place for a weekend's
sight-seeing. Another option, of course, is to stay in Manhattan
and take a day trip to the Second City, only 30 minutes away by
subway. Just take your walking shoes, and don't plan on hurrying
back after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brooklyn Academy of Music. Robert Spano, the Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra's new music director, remains very much a part of the
Brooklyn Philharmonic and its adventurous programming. The ensemble
sounds terrific, especially in the acoustically splendid BAM opera
house _ a gilded musical cage stacked with balconies, boxes and an
oval, coffered ceiling. Spano's next program, Nov. 17-18, includes
works by Schoenberg and Martin. Check the Web site
(www.brooklynphil.com) for the complete season.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs at the opera house is the BAMcafe, a hip destination
for good food and performance art Thursdays through Saturdays. Here
you can find spoken-word performances, Cuban dance parties, swing
nights and the likes of Duncan Sheik, Chocolate Genius or
``Spanglish salsa'' lord Coati Mundi and his RhumbaPhonic Band. The
monumental, vaulted room has the air of a European train station,
and the full-service cafe is a lovely place to have a schmear of
hummus and tapenade with a glass of vino before (or during!) a
concert. On the same level, BAM Rose Cinemas is a first-rate
art-film house. 30 Lafayette Ave. 718-636-4100, www.bam.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brooklyn Museum of Art. As the first museum in America to show
African objects as art (in 1923), this facility's African and
Egyptian collections are extraordinary. Yet I was most taken by
American works such as Georgia O'Keeffe's ``Brooklyn Bridge,''
Augustus Saint-Gaudens' bronze ``Head From the Adams Monument'' and
Abbott Thayer's luminescent portraits of his family. If there was a
pre-Raphaelite period in American art, Thayer and Saint-Gaudens
defined it.
</P>
<P>
   It was also fun to peek into the museum's period rooms _
oversize dollhouses furbished with mint-condition colonial
antiques. The gift shop was a little fusty, but I found some
wonderful, offbeat bargains _ like the leftover Nicholas and
Alexandra postcards, marked down to $1 for a triple pack of about
30, and an ultravivid red and yellow velvet-flocked pillow cover
that I'll probably never find a home for.
</P>
<P>
   While the scandalous ``Sensation'' show remains a footnote in
the museum's history, a Maxfield Parrish exhibit runs through Aug.
6 and a William Merritt Chase show through Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture garden in back is a nice place to lunch in the sun
and meander among the architectural fragments waiting for
restoration. 200 Eastern Parkway. 718-638-5000,
www.brooklynart.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brooklyn Botanic Garden. After Central Park, this garden is
the most significant green space in New York. Not only has the
80-year-old Japanese garden been recently refurbished, but the
bonsai collection of this living, breathing museum is boffo. Also,
I saw Amazon-size lily pads, roses named for Barbara Bush and the
Eiffel Tower and learned that the grounds are a hot spot for
shooting pop-music videos and Vogue covers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to learn about Brooklyn's cultural
contribution is to stroll through the celebrity path, which has
pavers for the likes of Lauren Bacall, Lena Horne, Susan Hayward,
Jacob Lawrence, Norman Mailer, Marianne Moore, Barbra Streisand,
Barbara Stanwyck _ and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shakespeare Garden, you can see everything from wormwood
and tongue of dog (``Macbeth'') to pomegranate (``All's Well That
Ends Well'') and rosemary (``Hamlet''). But not every fragrance
wafting here is from the garden _ that caraway you smell may be
from the spice factory two blocks away. 1000 Washington Ave.
718-623-7200, www.bbg.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brooklyn Heights. This is one of the most beautiful urban
spaces in America, a cornucopia of 19th-century architecture
dripping with gargoyles, stained glass and other whimsies.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Whitman onced lived on Cranberry Street, and Truman Capote
wrote ``In Cold Blood'' in the basement of 70 Willow St. With its
spas, cafes and coffee shops, the neighborhood around Montague
Street seems as spiffy as Soho and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   It's absolutely essential to visit the Promenade, where you
linger in the shadow of some of the city's best-situated real
estate while taking in the gorgeous Gotham view across the East
River. This walk is ideal for jogging at daybreak _ and making out
after sunset. Go west on any street between Cranberry and Remsen
and you'll run into the Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   Dining out
</P>
<P>
   For Middle Eastern food, hit Atlantic Avenue. For Italian, it's
Bensonhurst. Want Polish? Go to Greenpoint. And so it goes in this
ethnically vibrant town. Park Slope (particularly Fifth Avenue) and
Smith Street are the new culinary hot spots _ with food that can be
as ambitious as you'll find in Manhattan, though the vibe and the
prices are often more relaxed. Here are some neighborhood favorites
(for more recommendations, check out www.tasteofbrooklyn.com):
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Al Di La. With his corkscrew hair and narrow designer frames,
owner Emiliano Coppa is a funny guy who resembles Italian actor
Roberto Begnini _ no matter what you say, he bursts out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   His neighborhood gem is getting more and more press all the
time, and I see why. The lamb shank is burnished with root
vegetables and tender to the bone. Malfatti _ little balls of
Parmigiani-Reggiano cheese mixed with herbs and served with brown
butter and sage _ is very good and very rich.
</P>
<P>
   After I'd worked my way through a hefty three-course meal, Coppa
dropped by to offer me a glass of grappa on the house. ``Only for
those who really enjoy themselves,'' he said, making me feel very
special indeed. 248 Fifth Ave. 718-783-4565.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diner. In what looks like a funky old trailer, practically
underneath the Williamsburg Bridge, is an old-fashioned diner
that's been rethought by former bartenders from Balthazar and
Odeon.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday brunch, a friend and I sucked down a couple of Bloody
Marys and plowed our way through big platters of poached eggs,
slices of juicy-tender fresh pork and a hearty helping of beans.
Cowboy Eggs, they called it. At other hours, we hear the
traditional bistro food _ like skirt steak, fries and a martini _
really rocks. 85 Broadway. 718-486-3077.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cambodian Cuisine. The word is out about this hole-in-the-wall
across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. My $12 lunch included a
little dish of sweet pickled veggies and an enormous bowl of noodle
soup in spiky lemon grass-chili broth with shrimp and fishballs.
Very yummy and very cheap. 87 South Elliott Place. 718-858-3262.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Junior's. This is one of those '50s time-capsule spots where
you can get everything from cold borscht and potato pancakes to
beef tongue sandwiches and barbecue. Plus, you can't find a better
place for soaking up local color.
</P>
<P>
   The matzoh ball soup was a bowl of seductive little dumplings
floating in schmaltzy broth like manna from heaven. Next came an
appetizer portion of salmon cakes with Dijon hollandaise. And as it
was raining outside and I was waiting to check into my hotel, I
decided to go for broke with the open-face beef brisket sandwich.
Then I got depressed because I didn't have room for that
world-famous cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   But next time it's raining and I'm feeling sentimental for
Brooklyn, it's good to know Junior's will ship the cheescake
anywhere in the States (1-800-958-6467). 386 Flatbush Ave.
718-852-5257.
</P>
<P>
   And sleeping in
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bed &AMP; Breakfast on the Park. Overlooking Prospect Park and on
the edge of the vibrant shopping and dining neighborhood of Park
Slope, this is a quiet place to spend a night or two and get a
really good breakfast. I loved the glittering, chandeliered dining
room, painted a bright orange-red and chockablock with the owner's
collection of paintings and silver.

   You will pay about the same price as the Marriott (about $250 a
night), but you're liable to make new friends over breakfast. And
the staff, though a bit persnickety over details (arrival time,
payment method, forgotten keys), seems willing to go the extra
mile. They even offered breakfast to an old friend of mine who
dropped by to say hello. Take a virtual tour at www.bbnyc.com. 113

   &QR;  New York Marriott Brooklyn. Convenient to downtown, Brooklyn
Heights and the Brooklyn Bridge, this is where you stay if you are
working and need a quiet place to unwind. The rooms are tasteful
and commodious. There's an indoor pool, and subway service to
Manhattan is just outside the door. And as a New York Times writer
once noted, the sewing kit _ with six pre-threaded needles _ is
``the best ever.'' I'm hooked. 333 Adams St. 1-888-436-3759 or

   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: New York's LaGuardia airport is closest to the
center of Brooklyn, but if you can find a cheaper fare to JFK or
Newark, it may be worth the five extra miles in a cab. Several
airlines, prodded by an AirTran sale, currently offer a
14-day-advance fare of $168 round trip.

 &HT;    In Boston, `Face to Face' with van Gogh's genius as portraitist
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The woman behind us on the subway was having a grand
time. She tried her best to muffle her appreciative laughter while
eavesdropping on every word my then 10-year-old son, Daniel, was
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal with Monet?'' Daniel wanted to know. He
was a painter going blind, he said. Impressionism wasn't anything
more than being unable to see clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel spelled out his preference for Rene Magritte, David
Hockney and Degas (not the ballerinas, he insisted, it's the bronze
horses). But it was really his assessment of Vincent van Gogh that
sent the woman into gleeful delirium.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the sturdiness of Roger Ebert's thumb, Daniel
unleashed a two-word review of one of the most celebrated painters
in art history: ``Too brushy.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with some parental trepidation that I have escorted
Daniel here, six years after his subway lecture, to see the
all-portrait ``Van Gogh: Face to Face'' at Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts. It's a monumental mounting of 80 of the 19th-century Dutch
artist's paintings and drawings. Running through Sept. 24, the show
not only features eight self-portraits but 17 paintings of postman
Joseph Roulin and his family, favorite van Gogh subjects in late
1888 and early 1889 in Arles before the painter entered the asylum
in St.-Remy in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face to Face'' may not hold the wonder of seeing a premier
artist's most celebrated work. Van Gogh's ``The Starry Night,''
loaned out by the Museum of Modern Art only a dozen times in the
past century, and two other important works will be displayed at
Atlanta's High Museum of Art from Sept. 2 to Nov. 5. And, sadly,
``The Potato Eaters,'' the large study of expressive peasants, is
not here, either. But at its, forgive me, brushiest, these 80 works
combine to illustrate provocatively an artist searching for the
elusive connection to the human soul.
</P>
<P>
   Portraiture ``moves me to the depths, and it makes me feel
closer to infinity than anything else,'' van Gogh wrote in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   It's a remarkable statement from a man so greatly inept at
maintaining personal relationships. Maybe he couldn't communicate
very well with most humans, but as a largely self-taught artist, he
could paint the hell out of them.
</P>
<P>
   The show is divided into five major segments, starting with his
pencil drawings of aging pensioners in the early 1880s in The Hague
and proceeding through his time in Nuenen, where he produced the
dark character studies of peasants; in Paris, where, influenced by
avant-garde painters like Georges Seurat, he began using brighter,
clearer colors; in Arles, where the influence of Paul Gauguin
appears to have reached full bloom in his paintings of the Roulin
family and others; and in St.-Remy and Auvers, where, in between
seizures, his brush indeed seemed to sweep the broadest of his
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect illustrations for a bleak Dickens novel, van Gogh's
pensioner drawings are intensely dark, often deep-lined depictions.
In ``Orphan Man With Top Hat'' (1882), he physically rubbed the
black lithographic crayon he used to draw the old man's coat until
it hinted at the white underneath.
</P>
<P>
   My son will have none of it. He's immediately off to other
rooms, searching for more arresting work.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when all art seemed to astound Daniel. That was
years ago. He'd run ahead of me at Washington's National Gallery of
Art into the middle of a gallery of Dutch masterpieces, twirl 180
degrees, thrust his hands in the air and happily exclaim,
``Rembrandt!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 16, like many teenagers, he sometimes speaks only when
he has to _ unless the subject has landed on pro wrestling or Kevin
Smith flicks.
</P>
<P>
   I can only wonder what Daniel thought of ``Head of a Peasant''
(1885), the unnerving portrait of a young man in dark cap and worn
coat with bold, questioning eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``Face to Face'' reveals a perceived progression in
van Gogh's approach, from exact re-creations and a yearning to
reach inside a melancholy subject through his or her eyes to using
bold color to intimate mood and, in his own self-portraits,
dressing up in different outfits to perhaps see how physical change
affected his own tortured psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is most dramatic in a grouping of six self-portraits,
all painted from 1886 to 1888. Van Gogh hardly looks the same, his
eyes peering from different locations in their sockets, his head
sporting a gray felt or straw hat, his chin a little more pointed
here, his cheeks a little more full there. Each of the paintings
reads remarkably well from across the room, and one, the
extraordinary 1887 ``Self-Portrait'' with swirling dots of orange
and blue about the head, seemingly pushes itself forward.
</P>
<P>
   As you turn the corner from this series, the most dramatic
painting _ ``Skull'' (1887-88) _ stops the show. With a background
of yellow and white, the detailed skull is etched in red and black.
A thick-but-lean, agitated slash of white paint appears to throb
from the left forehead with the force of a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   The next room, the largest in the show, holds the bulk of the
Gauguin-influenced works, including the rare grouping of 17
paintings of the Roulin family. The latter includes six pieces,
three provocative paintings each of Joseph and his wife, Augustine.
Viewed as triptychs, they echo the self-portraits, experimenting
with floral backgrounds, skin tone and body shapes to evoke
different emotions, creating a greater whole.
</P>
<P>
   It's a while before Daniel surfaces. And after persistent
prodding, he reveals the painting that interests him the most. It
is ``Skull.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later, with a single word he states what the work said to
him. ``Dread.''
</P>
<P>
   All of van Gogh's soul-searching _ and there it is in one
syllable. He was a man haunted by misery, a man whose brushstrokes
often screamed. One who likely heard voices and could never stop
the ringing in his head. Not even, as this show illustrates, after
he took a knife to his ear.

 &HT;    Savvy shoppers find fashion bang for the buck at discount chains
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's chic to shop cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Discount chains make it easy for women to buy into fads by
offering less-expensive knockoffs of the season's most popular
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The fashionable bargains aren't limited to celebrity-endorsed
brands like Kmart's Jaclyn Smith and Kathy Ireland collections, or
Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford line. The hip stuff runs the gamut
from no-name brands to discounters' private labels.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy bargain hunters say the key to finding chic looks on the
cheap is knowing the trends and selecting items that complement
your existing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, we gave three style-conscious women a budget of
$100 each to scour the top three discount chains _ Target, Wal-Mart
and Kmart _ for the coolest summer merchandise on the racks. Here's
what they found:
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lee, Southeast editor of Women's Wear Daily, on Target:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the very best of the discount stores. They have
been one of the leaders in giving the same trends you find in the
high-end stores for a good price. It's not going to last a
lifetime; but for a season, it's fine. If you're creative with the
accessories, you can make it look expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her top picks: A two-piece, bubble-gum pink bathing suit ($20.80
for the set). ``It's very reminiscent of Calvin Klein's, which go
for $80 to $90,'' said Lee. Also, there's a sheer, white pareo wrap
($9). ``They're very, very hot to wear over a swimsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Krohngold, restaurant/bar interior designer, on Kmart:
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of bang for the buck,'' said Krohngold. ``You have
to dig deep, but if you go in with an open mind and keep abreast of
what's happening in fashion magazines you can find things. I can
take what Gucci's doing and go to Kmart.''
</P>
<P>
   Her top picks: A pair of black capri pants with fringe at the
bottom ($17.99). ``I'm 5-foot-10 and they were long enough,'' says
Krohngold, who has a hard time finding pants the length she needs.
</P>
<P>
   Also there was a boyish camp shirt by Route 66 ($9.99).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Route 66 is a good line of clothing. It's generic and
utilitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Noel, free-lance fashion photographer, on Wal-Mart:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how well some of this is made, but it's cute. I
had to dig for the funkier stuff. They've got good accessories and
jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her top picks: A white and red tank top with a Hostess logo
($6.87) and a red bandanna print halter ($12.97)
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep them,'' she said, ``especially the T-shirt!''

 &HT;    Gaga for Graham: Many believe senator ideal Gore running mate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Suddenly Bob Graham is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, shadowed by a pack of Florida journalists, he is
going to the home state of Al Gore to fill in for the vice
president as guest speaker at a dinner for Tennessee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he is going to New York to tour Ellis Island with
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He's in the current issue of Time, is a frequent guest on the
news talk shows and is getting lots of ink in the nation's
newspapers as the press rushes to handicap the Veep chase.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Florida's senior senator is all the buzz, a red hot
pick to become Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is that? Increasingly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole game is kind of like the stock market,'' said
Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst for the independent Cook
Political Report in Washington. ``Graham was very high for a while
a few months ago and then he dropped. Now, he's back up and the
trading is heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is being mentioned along with Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry as a finalist for the job. Some Democrats believe that in
that matchup, the nod would go to Graham. House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri is also being mentioned, but he seems
less likely than Graham or Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former Tennessee senator, and Graham have known each
other for years. Both are policy wonks with similar records on the
issues. Both were contenders in 1992 to be President Clinton's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Graham is unaffected by the attention. Privately,
Graham, 63, who has done nothing to squelch the speculation, is
said to be more than willing to accept if he gets the call from
Gore. And if the media speculation and the guesses of party
insiders are accurate, Graham has a much better shot at the No. 2
job this year than he had eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Graham would make a great vice president,'' said Attorney
General Bob Butterworth, Gore's Florida campaign chairman. ``This
state is competitive now, without Bob Graham. We're going to be a
lot more competitive with Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a ``celebrity death match'' in Florida, with Graham
taking on both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
said a Democrat close to Graham who believes that it would be a
very close race with no certain winner.
</P>
<P>
   With a new round of commercials playing in Florida and frequent
trips by Gore and Clinton, Democrats have made it clear that they
intend to challenge the Bush clan and its well-organized Florida
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists say Florida is a win even if they lose as
long as they can keep the race close and force the Republicans to
spend a lot of money here.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is far more important to Bush than it is to Gore.
Current thinking is that Gore has a lock on two of the four largest
states _ California and New York. Bush has a lock on Texas. That
leaves Florida and its critical 25 electoral votes. It takes 270
votes to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who was governor from 1979 to 1987, is extremely popular
with Florida Democrats. He also has been successful winning votes
from Republicans and independents. In 1998, he won reelection with
62 percent of the vote. In 1992, he won with 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Bob Graham would make the race a lot
more interesting,'' said Randy Enwright, a GOP political consultant
working with Bush. ``I still think we would win the state, but
Graham would make it a closer race.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that could hurt Graham is Democratic Party concern
that if a Gore-Graham ticket won, Republican Gov. Jeb Bush would be
able to appoint Graham's replacement in the Senate. Bush would be
certain to pick a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a factor,'' said Duffy. ``I don't think
Democrats have a realistic chance of winning control of the Senate,
but if they win two or three seats now, they could pick up two or
three more in 2002 and go over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duffy thinks winning the White House is more important to
Democrats than just holding on to Graham's seat. ``I think the next
few weeks are going to be very interesting.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy rainfalls exceeding 2 inches will douse parts of
the Northeast this weekend as an unusually strong low-pressure
system at 18,000 feet, which marks the center of a large pool of
cold air aloft, moves sluggishly southeast from the Great Lakes.
The focus of the heaviest rains will likely be in eastern
Pennsylvania, southeast New York and the high ground of southern
New England, where a strengthening flow of moist air from the
Atlantic is forced to rise over the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms, some with hail and damaging winds, will
erupt Saturday over parts of the Middle Atlantic states as very
warm and humid air rises into cold air aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, potent thunderstorms will flare across parts of the
northern Plains as a cold front vigorously lifts very warm and
moderately humid air.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: STORMY WEEKEND
</P>
<P>
   Low-level warmth and moisture, which meteorologists refer to as
``thermodynamics'', are typically high during the sultry days of
July. On the other hand, the amount of lift imparted to warm, moist
air by upper-level disturbances, which meteorologists refer to as
``dynamics'', is often limited in July because winds aloft are
weak. This weekend, however, dynamic lifting by an active upper-air
disturbance dropping south from Canada will be unseasonably strong,
likely setting the stage for some exceptionally wet and stormy
weather across parts of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. &QL;

 &HT;    Former Atlanta novelist Anne Rivers Siddons' `Nora, Nora'
recalls life in fictional Georgia town where similarities to her
childhood abound
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 16
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since Anne Rivers Siddons packed
up and moved to Charleston, S.C., but the novelist clearly still
has Georgia on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Siddons makes frequent trips back to Atlanta to visit friends,
and her new novel, ``Nora, Nora'' (HarperCollins, $25), is a
nostalgic coming-of-age tale set in Lytton, Ga., a fictional
version of her hometown of Fairburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hadn't realized how much you miss your context,''
Siddons says. ``In Atlanta, I knew where every road went and knew
where everybody was. It's taken me a while to learn that about
Charleston. I do miss that feeling of just seamlessly belonging to
a place. I'll never miss the traffic and what the city has turned
into lately. Still, when I think of Atlanta, I think of my time of
being young there, in the '60s and '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old author has written about those years before, in
``Downtown,'' ``Peachtree Road'' and other best-selling novels. And
it's the same era that is the backdrop for ``Nora, Nora.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1961, the novel is the story of 12-year-old Peyton
McKenzie, a frail, nervous, motherless girl who considers herself a
loser. But Peyton's life changes dramatically when her beautiful,
eccentric cousin Nora rolls into town in her Thunderbird coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Siddons acknowledges there is an autobiographical thread that
runs through the new novel. From her summer home in Maine, Siddons
talked about the parallels between Peyton's life and her own
small-town childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems like the 1960s are your favorite time? Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do keep going back to that time like a homing pigeon. It's
an interesting time, especially for those who were raised in small
towns in the South. It was a big leap from my hometown of Fairburn
to Atlanta, but I loved the journey. It was such an exciting time
of change. I feel sorry for kids now who don't have something they
can establish an allegiance with, like we did with the civil rights
movement or the Vietnam War. There's a hole in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How autobiographical is ``Nora, Nora''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I felt a little like Peyton when I was growing up in
Fairburn, Ga. I knew that I would have to leave my insular little
world and live in a bigger world. I was a little afraid. Everything
was so gentle then. You knew you couldn't stay there, and you don't
know what's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the inspiration for this book?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to go back and look at that time in my life _ the
seventh grade and the enormous sense that everything was about to
change. And I realized how vulnerable young women were at that time
and how easy it was to fall back into the life they knew. Unless
you had a Nora in your life, nobody in your town was going to teach
you about the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you have a Nora?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, and I wish I had. Nora is a creation of my deepest
wishes. I was an only child, and I always wanted an older sister.
Then I realized what I always wanted was a Nora, someone who would
help me not be afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How difficult was it to recapture the mood of 1961?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was surprisingly easy. I had to go back and see what the
songs of that year were. But the ter three books I still want to
write. I'd like to do a novel about suburban Atlanta if I can keep
from turning it into a caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you feel about e-books and publishing on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's fine if people want to do it that way. I do not
want to sit at a screen and read it. I don't think I want to write
a serialized book online, like Stephen King is doing. I think I
would feel extremely constrained.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    AME elects first woman bishop
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In November 1787, when Richard Allen stormed out
of the predominantly white St. George's Church in Philadelphia and
formed the African Free Society (later renamed the African
Methodist Episcopal Church), the thought of bringing a woman into
the hierarchy of his clan never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of selecting a female to the lofty position of
AME bishop could not escape the minds of the 1,800 delegates who
attended the order's closely scrutinized General Conference at the
Cincinnati Convention Center this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark, second-ballot vote, the Rev. Vashti Murphy
McKenzie, 53, of Baltimore, Md., was elected to the Episcopary,
becoming the first female in the 213-year history of the church to
assume that seat.
</P>
<P>
   Although the selection of McKenzie wasn't a total surprise, it
nevertheless rolled back two centuries of inertia and sent a clear
message to religious orders that continue to exclude women from
church leadership.
</P>
<P>
   From all reports, the Democratic and Republican presidential
conventions will be hard pressed to match the drama, intrigue and
unfeigned elation of the AME general conference in Cincinnati. The
meeting had all the trappings of a political convention. Frantic
delegates waved banners, passed out fliers and campaigned hard for
their candidates. Because AME bylaws require a simple majority vote
to elect a bishop, the first ballot failed to produce a clear
winner.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote was taken. Kathleen Henderson, a member of
Dayton's Wayman AME Church, was on the floor of the Convention
Center when the groundbreaking tally came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was phenomenal and exciting,'' she gushed. ``I'm so proud,
certainly of Bishop McKenzie, but I'm also proud of the electoral
body that brought her forward on her own merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body spoke very loudly and said, 'It's time.' It was a
fantastic feeling to be there and witness her acceptance speech. I
feel really, really proud.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, who delivered the keynote speech at Wayman's 160th
anniversary in 1995, has extensive Miami Valley ties. She earned
her doctor of ministry degree from Dayton's United Theological
Seminary and has been a trustee at Wilberforce University since
1998. Wilberforce director of university relations, Gwendolyn
Brown, remembers McKenzie as a ``wonderfully spirited and dynamic
individual with keen business instincts and a profound spiritual
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   As pastor of the Payne AME church in Baltimore, McKenzie has
tripled its membership in six years to more than 1,700 members
while remaining a champion of programs to cure urban ills. As
freshly minted AME bishop, she will have to relinquish her duties
as pastor of Payne as a prelude to her new post as head of the 18th
Episcopal District in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the ministry my goal was not to become an AME
bishop.'' McKenzie told Associated Press. ``My goal was to take
care of the needs of people, spiritual and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, I began to realize that God's intention for
my life was beyond the local congregation. Things were moving to a
ministry that is much broader.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's election comes on the heels of the recent vote by the
Southern Baptist Convention, which effectively banned women from
the ministry. And as the debate on the role of women in church
leadership drags on, McKenzie let it be known in her acceptance
speech that she is mindful of the struggle it toos, to transform
themselves from cooks or maids to entrepreneurs. In short, Madam
C.J. Walker spawned the entire African-American hair and beauty
industry as we know it. And she became very wealthy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Rose'' is a compelling, fictionalized account of
Walker's long and tedious journey from poverty-choked sharecropper
to philanthropic businesswoman. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove to
former slaves on a Louisiana plantation in 1867. In 1874, both her
parents died of yellow fever, leaving Sarah and her older sister to
fend for themselves as sharecroppers and later as washerwomen.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah gains and loses a husband (to racial violence), learns to
read and raises a bright and headstrong daughter before, at nearly
age 40, she develops the formula for ``Wonderful Hair Grower'' and
becomes the affluent and cultured Madam C.J. Walker (a name she
acquires through her second marriage). Novelist Tananarive Due
spends as much time on the hungry years as she does on the wonder
years that follow _ years in which Walker builds a factory, a
training school and a mansion.
</P>
<P>
   With the patience of a born storyteller, Due slowly allows
Walker's stirring story to unfold. She portrays Walker as an
intelligent, determined visionary who was destined to succeed. At
the same time, she doesn't soft-pedal Walker's flaws: Most notably,
she was a workaholic, before the condition had a name, and the
tough standards she held for herself and others eventually strained
her relationship with her daughter, talented socialite A'Lelia, and
ultimately killed her, as Due tells it. Yet, even while the
novelist gives us this well-balanced view of Walker, she never
veers from her optimistic narrative.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of triumphant, historical fiction is a departure for
Due, author of two previous novels, ``The Between'' and ``My Soul
to Keep,'' both of which featured elements of magic realism and
even leaned toward science fiction. (The only such element in this
novel is Walker's claim that her secret hair formula was revealed
to her in a dream.) Yet Due seems perfectly at home with the
material _ an impressive achievement given that she inherited it
from Alex Haley.
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1992, the acclaimed author of ``Roots'' was
working on a novel about Walker; his estate selected Due to
complete the book, using the thousands of pages of research Haley
had amassed. Due was an inspired choice: As a thirtysomething black
woman, she brings a contemporary sense to Walker's story that even
Haley would have been hard-pressed to provide. And, because the
book is fiction, she is able to explore Walker's interior life with
much more freedom than a biography would have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a slight discomfort: Readers are left wondering
how much of the story is true and how much Due has invented. The
seamless narrative makes it hard to tell _ which, of course, was
the author's goal. Still, reading this historical fiction might
make you crave a straightforward biography. Luckily, you won't have
to wait long. Early next year, Scribner will publish a biography of
Walker by her great-great-granddaughter, journalist A'Lelia
Bundles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Due's page-turner should go a long way toward helping
Madam C.J. Walker, the Oprah of her era, gain a following among
21st-century readers.

<P>
   Leavin' Trunk Blues. By Ace Atkins. St. Martin's. $22.95. 256
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The late John D. MacDonald began with blue and finished with
silver. When he died in 1986, he was just about at rainbow's end.
``The Lonely Silver Rain'' was the last in MacDonald's Travis McGee
series, 20 detective mysteries with a color in the title and a
laconic Florida boat bum at their center.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been ``Free Fall in Crimson,'' ``The Turquoise
Lament'' or ``Nightmare in Pink,'' but there was a sense in which
MacDonald was writing the same story from one novel to the next. He
was giving us the enigmatic McGee, with his lone-wolf suspicions
about love, his doubts about progress, his sidelong glances at a
past never fully revealed to us.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery novel depends on its contrivances of character and
setting, and more often than not is the better for it. A familiar
world doesn't have to be a believable world. It's enough that a
reader return, suspending reality and living in a world he knows
intimately.
</P>
<P>
   In only two novels, Ace Atkins has learned how to use the
devices so adeptly you hardly notice them. At the same time, he has
created a character, Nick Travers, we want to know better.
``Crossroad Blues'' involved the murder of blues guitarist Robert
Johnson in 1938. Crackling in incident, it was an impressive debut,
but it was clearly enough a first novel. ``Leavin' Trunk Blues'' is
a more textured, more accomplished piece of fiction. Travers is
back, and so is the music. The noir world of New Orleans' French
Quarter returns only as backdrop. Travers, the gone-to-seed blues
historian, is on Chicago's South Side on Christmas Eve. Seventy
miles away, in a prison cell, sits Ruby Walker, convicted of
killing a man named Billy Lyons in September 1959. She'd been one
of Chicago's great blues singers once, and Lyons was both her
producer and her lover.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Travers comes upon some letters and asks to
interview her. Walker agrees on condition that he investigate facts
she says will uncover the truth of Lyons' death. Up from New
Orleans drives Nick Travers, unaware there are people on the South
Side who want to keep that truth buried. One of them is the
fearsome Stagger Lee, his name an echo of black folklore going back
to the days of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Crossroad Blues,'' Atkins' love of the blues infuses his
story, and it now and then threatens to overload his narrative. But
he instinctively knows where his story needs to go next. In this
respect, he already is a more disciplined writer than MacDonald,
who would interrupt his story to let McGee muse on urban sprawl,
the anonymity of a credit-card culture or the loneliness of women
married to rich men. Travers is not yet so sharply defined as
McGee. But he has become a more complicated figure in this second
novel and so, too, has the milieu in which the story takes place:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Forty-third Street, aka Muddy Waters Avenue, Nick watched a
group of teenagers staring at their reflection in a cracked mirror
propped against an abandoned warehouse. Next door, a wino sat on a
bucket looking at his rotted shoes as a bunch of kids played
hopscotch by a liquor store. The kids smiled and giggled, oblivious
to the poverty around them.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Travers who must carry the story, and Atkins gives
readers enough without giving too much. There are details about
Travers' past that you don't know, but you discern his character by
his actions.
</P>
<P>
   That Atkins, at 29, should pick it up so quickly is a side
story. It wasn't many years ago that he was attending junior high
school in Marietta, and then Dunwoody High School (his mother,
Doris Atkins, still lives in Dunwoody). In his sophomore year, the
Atkinses moved to Auburn, Ala., where his late father, Billy Atkins
Sr., had been a football star on Auburn's 1957 national
championship team. The younger Atkins would later play for Auburn's
unbeaten 1993 team, an undersize defensive end whose fourth-quarter
sack of Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel made the cover of Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But he was an unusual kind of college football player. Lunkhead
coaches resented his refusal to gorge himself at the training table
so he could bulk up to 270 pounds. He told them he was quicker and
healthier at 213. And they noticed he was always reading or
scribbling stories in a spiral notebook, and smirked. The Poet,
they called him.
</P>
<P>
   The Poet wasn't at Auburn to find out how high he'd go in the
NFL's cattle-call. He took serious courses, earned a degree and for
the past several years has been a crime reporter for the Tampa
Tribune. He's written about cops, carnies and con men, and once
walked into a biker bar in Ohio to learn something of a killer
who'd been a regular.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist must have a nose for human motive, and novelists of a
certain kind must have an ear for the language of people with no
way out. Atkins has honed both to a high degree. When he was at
Auburn, he told someone he would rather meet John D. MacDonald than
Joe Montana. It was something else his coaches wouldn't have
understood.

MANDELA CLOSES AIDS CONFERENCE WITH CALL TO MOVE BEYOND
CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Closing the 13th International Aids
Conference Friday, Nelson Mandela urged scientists to move beyond
their concerns about South Africa's president and to focus on
combating the epidemic that is raging across the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech punctuated by repeated applause, Mandela said the
world could not afford to be distracted by the furor surrounding
President Thabo Mbeki, his successor, who has questioned whether
HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela did not clarify Mbeki's views on the subject, but told
his audience that Mbeki was committed to fighting the sickness in
South Africa, the country with the largest number of people
infected with the AIDS virus, 4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much unnecessary attention around this conference had been
directed toward a dispute that is unintentionally distracting from
the real life-and-death issues we are confronted with as a country,
a region, a continent and a world,'' said Mandela, who handed over
the reigns of power to Mbeki one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of the grave threat posed by HIV/AIDS, we have to
rise above our differences and combine our efforts to save our
people,'' he said. ``History will judge us harshly if we fail to do
so, and right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech marked the end of the first international AIDS
conference to be held in a developing country. About 34 million
people, most of them in Africa, are infected with HIV. And this
week, scientists debated the best ways to battle the scourge,
finding hope in studies that suggest circumcision reduces the risk
of infection and disappointment in a report that questions the
long-term benefit of a drug intended to protect newborns from the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   But the many scientific developments announced here were almost
overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Mbeki. He addressed the
conference only once, in the opening speech on Sunday, when he
singled out extreme poverty, rather than AIDS, as the biggest
killer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and conference halls at the convention
center here, the president dominated conversations nearly as much
as the talk about future vaccines. Last week, the scientific
magazine Nature published a declaration signed by 5,000 scientists
from around the world who described the link between HIV and AIDS
as ``clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week, in panel after panel, scientists and activists
criticized Mbeki, who stirred the debate by consulting with two
U.S. researchers who argue that poverty and malnutrition, not HIV,
cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the link between poverty and AIDS, which is well
established. And government officials here emphasize that Mbeki has
never said that HIV did not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers fear that Mbeki's heavy emphasis on poverty and
his talks with AIDS dissidents may fuel confusion among ordinary
people who may assume they can engage in risky sexual behavior
because the president has raised questions about HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, to put it bluntly,'' Roy Anderson, a
prominent AIDS researcher, said this week of Mbeki's speech. ``In
South Africa, it's really such an acute problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly lashed back. Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang dismissed the criticism and accused the media of
distorting Mbeki's message. She insisted that the president was
committed to fighting the disease by encouraging safe sex and by
sponsoring research on drug therapies and a possible vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he deny something he has not said?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mandela also defended Mbeki. He called him ``a man of
great intellect'' and emphasized that he ``continues to place this
issue on the top of the national and continental agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela acknowledged that the government, under his leadership
and Mbeki's, had fallen short in its efforts to fight the disease.
Scientists and AIDS activists have repeatedly accused South African
leaders of a lack of leadership in combating the epidemic. In 1993,
HIV infected 4 percent of South Africa's adult population. Now the
figure is 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will, with me, be the first to concede that much more
remains to be done,'' Mandela said. ``I do not doubt for one moment
that he will proceed to tackle this task with the resolve and
dedication he is known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela did differ with Mbeki on some points. For instance, he
emphasized his reluctance to engage in the scientific debate,
saying he lacked adequate knowledge to contribute seriously.
Several scientists and commentators have criticized Mbeki for
delving so deeply into an issue in which he lacks expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mbeki has questioned the safety of AIDS drugs, Mandela
stressed the urgency of using them to reduce the transmission of
the virus from mothers to newborns, saying such measures ``have
been proven to be essential.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mandela, who walked slowly and stiffly to the microphone,
leavened his speech with humor and populism, reminding his audience
not to forget the ordinary people who live with the disease. And
several delegates said they were cheered by his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if he had anticipated a feeling in the audience,
that this was becoming a hindrance to our making progress,'' said
Benon Biryahwaho, a virologist from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Remie Rwankote, an immunologist in Britain,
nodded in agreement, saying the speech left him with hope for South
Africa. ``We think they are ready to act,'' he said.

By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Even in the face of staggeringly grim
statistics and estimates that one-half of this country's young
people could eventually die of AIDS, the 13th International AIDS
Conference _ the first ever held in a developing nation _ ended
Friday on a euphoric note.
</P>
<P>
   A delegate from Switzerland predicted that this conference,
attended by more than 12,000 scientists, doctors, nurses and
activists, would go down in history ``as the one that turned the
tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the high points: Recruitment of volunteers for the first
human trial of an AIDS vaccine for Africa was announced. Many said
the meeting prompted an unprecedented response from governments and
pharmaceutical companies. (Merck &AMP; Co. Inc. announced a $50 million
collaboration with the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation in Botswana,
for example.) New data gave irrefutable evidence that a $4 course
of an anti-HIV drug could prevent thousands of new infections in
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will be able to stop the process that started here,''
said Stefano Vella, president of the 10,000-member International
AIDS Society, which organizes world conferences on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   All week, on the fringes of the scientific presentations, a
debate raged over the South African government's reaction to the
epidemic. South Africa has the highest number of HIV-infected
people in the world, and its leaders have been accused of
exhibiting ``irresponsibility that borders on criminality,'' as a
deputy president of the World Bank put it.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Mukasa Monico, a lawyer in Uganda who works with AIDS
support organizations, said, ``We know what works. AIDS is now a
crisis in governance.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a closing speech, former South African president Nelson
Mandela, a beloved figure described by the conference chairman as
``an icon of the century . . . the center of gravity of this
country,'' brushed all that aside as a distraction from ``the real
life-and-death issues.'' His grandfatherly admonition, in effect,
reduced the dispute to a squabble among overly bright children.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The ordinary people of the continent and the world _
particularly the poor who on our continent will again carry a
disproportionate burden of this scourge _ would, if anybody cared
to ask their opinions, wish that the dispute about . . . politics
or science be put on the back burner and that we proceed to address
the needs and concerns of those suffering and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela called the conference ``the one event where every word
uttered, every gesture made, had to be measured against the effect
it can and will have on the lives of millions of concrete, real
human beings all over this continent and planet.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous months, South African President Thabo Mbeki
dismissed the anti-HIV drug AZT as toxic. He has been harshly
criticized for refusing to implement a national program to
distribute anti-retrovirals to rape victims and pregnant women.
This spring, he invited dissident scientists who argue that HIV
does not cause AIDS to join an influential advisory panel,
prompting some researchers to call for a boycott of the $10 million
international AIDS conference.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate escalated, and demands for better access to
medication intensified, some drug companies decided to send fewer
representatives to the conference, or to not attend at all, out of
concerns for security. Delegates housed in distant locations were
able to move into vacant hotel rooms closer to the conference
center. Organizers worried they would not break even on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the meeting drew 4,000 people from Africa, 3,000
from the United States, 3,000 from Europe, with the remainder
coming from other countries. (The 2002 conference is taking place
in Spain.)
</P>
<P>
   In his opening address to the conference, Mbeki disappointed
many delegates by not pronouncing HIV the cause of AIDS and by
focusing instead on poverty's ravaging impact on health. In
response to criticism, South African government officials
repeatedly emphasized that Mbeki never said that HIV does not cause
AIDS. They pointed to numerous examples of the country's efforts to
fight the disease. For example, prior to Mandela's election in
1994, annual condom distribution was 5 million. Today, it is over
190 million.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang reminded guests at a
gala dinner that many of the country's current leaders had fought
to the death during apartheid for better quality of life. ``Why
would we be prepared to do that, and yet not be prepared to do
everything in our power to save the very lives of the people that
we led to freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Salim Karim, scientific chair of the conference, reconciled
Mbeki's emphasis on poverty with what is known about AIDS. Living
on a meager income is associated with many common diseases, Karim
said. Even before HIV, South Africa had one of the highest
tuberculosis rates. Each year, there are thousands of measles cases
and last year there was a malaria epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's migrant labor system, an artifact of apartheid
that forces men and women to leave home for long periods to work in
the cities, ``is one of the main reasons this country is
experiencing an explosive epidemic,'' he said. ``Poverty is part of
that profile.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, as elsewhere, elders rarely talk frankly about sex
with youngsters. But Mandela, who turns 82 on Tuesday, broke free
of tradition, calling for safe sex promotion, use of condoms and
early treatment of curable, sexually transmitted diseases. He said
voluntary HIV testing and counseling are ``essential in the fight
against AIDS.'' He drew applause for his plea for ``large-scale
actions'' to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hoosen Coovadia, a University of Natal HIV specialist who
chaired the Conference, told Mandela afterward, ``You cannot
imagine how your speech is music to our ears. It has answered so
many spoken and unspoken questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Malegapuru Makgoba, president of the South African Medical
Research Council, the country's largest research body, said the
conference had set a new standard: ``Maybe things will never be the
same. I feel proud to be associated with that.''

 &HT;    Comic artist bets on ethnic heroes for super success
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Brace yourself. You're about to meet the
world's first multi-racial, all-female, half-human half-alien
superhero team.
</P>
<P>
   Raven's the leader. She's black, has the mind of a strategist,
and has super-vision. Rampage, a Hispanic woman, has mechanically
augmented super-strength. Bombshell can explosively disintegrate _
and reassemble _ herself. (She's white.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Asian, Silhouette . . . well, we're not sure what she
can do yet.
</P>
<P>
   They're the first characters to debut in a new comic book called
``The Crusaders.'' The book is the first offering from Loud Comics,
a West Palm Beach-based comics company. It's operated out of
36-year-old publisher Tim Mitchell's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crusaders'' marks the realization of a dream Mitchell has
had for a few years now: To work in the comics business. Mitchell,
who gives private music lessons, has read comics since he was a
boy. He'd always done doodles and sketches, too. But in 1997, he
decided that wasn't enough and began submitting his portfolio to
large publishers like Marvel Comics.
</P>
<P>
   When the big boys wouldn't bite, Mitchell became discouraged.
But on a 1998 plane flight home from a Chicago comic convention,
something happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met a salesman on the plane,'' Mitchell says. ``He looked at
my stuff and said, `Why don't you just start your own company'. So
by the time I got back to Florida, I had that voice in my head. I
decided, `Let's do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So he did. In 1999, Mitchell created Loud Comics and the
characters in his ``Loud Universe,'' the imaginary Earth where
superheroes are reality. The guy has big dreams for ``The
Crusaders'' and the other comic titles he's planning. He wants his
characters to eventually become American icons like Spider-Man and
Superman.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to make decisions fueled by creativity and business
savvy. For instance, the decision to have a multi-racial cast in
``The Crusaders'' was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-white group isn't what's happening in America,''
Mitchell explains. ``If you live here in Florida you see people
from all walks of life. Hispanic, Middle Eastern, they're all here.
And if you're going to do superheroes _ who are hopefully going to
be read by people all over the planet _ then you need to have
something they can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart thinking, and ``Crusaders'' (which Mitchell pencils) is
just the beginning for the upstart company. In the fall, Mitchell
hopes to release ``Scream Theatre,'' a 100-page quarterly comic
that'll feature vampires, morticians and rock 'n' roll. (That rock
'n' roll part, Mitchell knows a lot about: In the '80s, he was a
guitarist for the local heavy metal band Crazy Agnes.)
</P>
<P>
   After ``Scream Theatre'' debuts, Loud Comics will release ``Man:
Zero,'' a man-turned-cosmic entity story. It should debut sometime
next year. And ``Crusaders 2'' is already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a hard journey for Mitchell and his wife, Rebecca, who
writes ``Crusaders.'' The financing for Loud Comics is coming from
the money Mitchell earns giving music lessons. The first issue of
``Crusaders'' is being sold exclusively on the World Wide Web,
while Mitchell looks for a mainstream distributor. And his
employees _ young unknowns in the comics industry, from around the
country _ aren't getting paid much.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone involved believes in the dream, Mitchell says.
That's what matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories will be strong enough that when you sit down to
read it, you'll say, `You know, there's a lot to this team','' he
says. ``I want people to become fans because they like what we do.
Spider-Man isn't a fad. He's here to stay. I hope our characters
become the same way.''

MULTIMEDIA EFFORT TAKES ON SEX TABOO IN S. AFRICA 

</HEADLINE>
 AIDS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The billboard next to the freeway
is startling, impossible to miss. It features a stark quote from a
14-year-old child:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sex. Will I die?``
</P>
<P>
   It's a pressing question in this country, where an estimated 4
million people are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say young South Africans are particularly at risk: In
the past year, the infection rate among adolescents age 15 to 20
increased by 65 percent. Yet straight talk about the subject is
rare and misinformation is rampant, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious, multimedia initiative called loveLife is
attempting to break through taboos and encourage frank discussion
about sex and gender relations. It features hip, in-your-face
advertisements (such as the billboard), radio programs, train cars
with slogans splashed on their sides and the country's first-ever
television talk show for young people about sex.
</P>
<P>
   In one TV episode, a 15-year-old boy put the problem eloquently:
``We cannot speak to our parents about love. They don't want us to
fall in love. So how can we talk to them about sex? If we can't
talk to them about sex, how do we talk to them about HIV and AIDS
and condoms?''
</P>
<P>
   LoveLife, sponsored by the U.S.-based Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, is the country's largest HIV prevention program for
adolescents. Its aim is to halve the incidence of HIV among 15- to
20-year-olds over the next three to five years. The Bill &AMP; Melinda
Gates Foundation announced a $7 million donation to the program
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, where
the train was stationed for four days, national director Shirley
Ngwenya has been swamped with phone calls, e-mails and requests for
youth centers and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faxes, I can't cope!'' she said. ``It's from grass roots
to corporate sector. It's a demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A new toll-free sexual health hot line receives between 70,000
and 123,000 calls a month, depending on where the phone number is
marketed, said loveLife media director Judi Nwokedi. LoveLife has
not yet advertised the number on radio, the most far-reaching
medium, because ``we don't believe we have the capacity to cope
with the calls,'' Nwokedi said. ``Which shows the need loveLife
tapped into. It was desperate.''

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Since the early 1980s, Chrysler has
cultivated a reputation for daring, innovative designs, beating
bigger rivals by creating the minivan market and by revitalizing
the full-size pickup truck market with the burly Dodge Ram. Just
this year, its new PT Cruiser, an eccentric combination of a 1930s
gangster car and a minivan, has been such a hot seller that dealers
across the country have months-long waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   So four years ago, when Chrysler formed a team to start
designing the next generation of minivans for introduction late
this summer, the pressure was fierce to come up with another big
step forward. After all, Chrysler invented the traditional minivan
in 1983, producing a vehicle that Ford Motor and General Motors had
studied for years but never had the courage to build. Chrysler has
dominated the minivan market ever since with breakthroughs like the
introduction of driver's-side sliding doors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But a few months before the minivan team was formed in February
1996, Chrysler executives were shocked by the public's hostile
reaction to Ford's radical restyling of its Taurus sedan and wagon.
Customers deserted the Taurus in droves, allowing the Honda Accord
and Toyota Camry to seize the lead in the midsize car market. So as
work began on the new minivans, Chrysler officials struggled to
understand what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The results of their deliberations are in, and the new minivans
will go on sale in late August. After much market research, which
found that many buyers liked their minivans pretty much the way
they were, Chrysler, now part of DaimlerChrysler AG, decided to
play it cautious. It made many small changes in its minivans _ the
Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town &AMP; Country _
offering, among other things, more powerful engines and an
optional, powered rear liftgate that goes up and down at the push
of a button. But it did not alter the fundamental design.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's experience with the Taurus ``set the fear in,'' said
David C. McKinnon, Chrysler's director of vehicle exterior design.
``You don't want to depart too much from your script if you have a
successful product.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations capture headlines when they make big changes in
products with household names. Sometimes those changes prove
disastrous, as when Coca-Cola introduced a new Coke. But far more
common are the modest changes that companies make periodically,
even in best-selling products, to keep them from seeming out of
date.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler executives say their decisions reflected a careful
balancing of risks. The managers worried about the dangers of not
going far enough, which could result in losing less-loyal customers
to rival minivans like the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Ford
Windstar and Pontiac Montana. They fretted about the popularity of
sport utility vehicles, which now outsell minivans by more than
2-1, and made some adjustments to give the minivans a slightly more
``aggressive'' appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, they punted. They stuck with a basic design that
has led the market since 1983 and was last restyled in the
mid-1990s. Yet its market share has eroded to 42 percent, and other
automakers now make models that look similar, score better on
government crash tests and offer conveniences like third rows of
seats that fold into the floor of the cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically came to the conclusion that the formula was the
thing to preserve,'' said Gordon L. Rinschler, the engineer and
DaimlerChrysler vice president who oversaw the minivan redesign
project.
</P>
<P>
   Rival automakers, which have long struggled to catch Chrysler in
the minivan market, contend that Chrysler has decided to milk the
profits from selling to repeat buyers, instead of spending the
money to attract new ones. ``We're raising the bar, whereas
Chrysler decided to invest its money elsewhere,'' said Jim
Townsend, the marketing manager for the recently updated Ford
Windstar, the nation's second-best selling minivan after the Dodge
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler executives reject that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   But marketing experts say DaimlerChrysler's decision to make
incremental changes is fairly typical of big companies these days,
as so many are loath to experiment with proven success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when companies come up with an innovative idea, they
tend to choose new names and create separate brands, despite the
formidable advertising expenses involved. With an attitude of ``if
it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' companies limit their real
money-spinners to cosmetic changes.
</P>
<P>
   A percentage point of market share is now worth more in many
industries than it was 10 or 20 years ago, because the markets for
so many consumer goods have become so fragmented as the country has
become more culturally diverse, said C.B. Bhattacharya, an
associate professor of marketing at Boston University. Global
competition from many different brands has intensified, too. ``If
you want to protect your share, then that calls for caution,''
Bhattacharya said.
</P>
<P>
   At DaimlerChrysler, wariness of big changes in its minivans is
particularly noteworthy, because the company, though the minivan
leader, is the third-largest player overall in the American auto
market, after GM and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, said Jag Sheth, a marketing professor at Emory
University in Atlanta, companies that are not No. 1 or No. 2 in
their markets tend to be the most innovative, because they have
less to lose. In fact, Chrysler's overall record is one of the best
illustrations of that axiom, Sheth said.
</P>
<P>
   But these are prosperous times, and automakers, like companies
in many consumer industries, tend to be most cautious when sales
are strong. As the current economic expansion gets older, ``there
is a natural conservatism,'' said James R. Gregory, the chief
executive of Corporate Branding, a brand strategy company in
Stamford, Conn. ``People want to hold on to the gains.'' It takes a
recession or heavy financial losses to drive many companies to take
risks with successful products.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both the ground-breaking Taurus sedans and the minivan that
Chrysler introduced in late 1995 were designed during the 1991
recession. Chastened by public reaction to that Taurus, Ford
redesigned it for the 2000 model year to make it one of the
blandest, most nondescript midsize cars _ its plain, rectangular
windows replacing the ovals that made the previous version so
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chrysler has more to lose if it miscalculates. Financial
analysts calculate that minivans contribute as much as one-third of
the profits of the Chrysler group, even though they account for
less than one-fifth of the vehicles it sells. And minivans are
particularly important to the company now, as high gasoline prices
could threaten its other big source of profits, Jeep and Dodge
Durango sport utility vehicles. While Chrysler expects gasoline
prices to fall later this summer, the relatively fuel-efficient
minivans could gain in sales at the expense of sport utilities if
prices stay high, said James P. Holden, Chrysler's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler acquired Chrysler in 1998, after the design of the new
minivans, but the merger produced one windfall for Chrysler:
Daimler's Mercedes division had been planning to introduce a luxury
minivan closely modeled on the Town &AMP; Country, but canceled the
project after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lavishly financed assaults over the years by practically
every other large automaker, Chrysler remains king in minivans,
with its 42 percent market share. Though that is less than half its
peak of 90.5 percent in 1988, Chrysler's dominance in the category
still surpasses that of any rival in any other major segment of the
American auto market.
</P>
<P>
   That success has been based on customers like Conrad and Dede
Weil, who have bought a new Chrysler minivan every two or three
years since 1983 and plan to buy another Town &AMP; Country as soon as
the latest design goes on sale next month. ``I put my order in for
the next one a year or two ago, before I even knew what it would
look like,'' said Weil, a real estate developer in Houston who
trusted Chrysler not to make radical changes.
</P>
<P>
   Until the new minivans go on sale, the best place to see one is
in the windowless, tightly guarded design dome at Chrysler's
headquarters here. Its circular floor, covered in dark gray
carpeting, is wide enough to hold a dozen automobiles for
executives' review. Its white, hemispherical ceiling has soft,
diffuse lighting that minimizes glare.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a new, white, long-wheelbase Town &AMP;
Country was the only vehicle in the room. McKinnon walked around
it, pointing out subtle changes from the previous model. He
occasionally crouched, holding out his hands to triangulate, like
an artist before a large painting.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the front of the vehicle, he gestured toward the
hood, an inch higher than on previous models, and the headlights,
twice as big and 80 percent brighter. ``It gives it a flush,
aggressive look,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the driver's side, he pointed to the lower edge of the
rear side windows, which now tilt upward at a slight angle, instead
of being nearly flat. ``It gives it a little more aggressive
tilt,'' he said. The wheel wells are also flared out slightly, as
on many sport utilities. And the engines on the new minivans have
180 to 230 horsepower, up from 140 to 180.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether Chrysler was trying to imitate the
aggressive appearance of sport utilities, McKinnon grew defensive.
``It was nothing intentional,'' he said, quickly deciding that
``dynamic'' might be a better word than ``aggressive'' to describe
the new features.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is trying to make some of its minivans,
particularly the Pontiac Montana, look more like sport utilities,
and the reasons are clear. Minivan sales have doubled since 1990,
but sport utility vehicle sales have nearly quadrupled. Pontiac
enjoyed immediate success in 1997 by marketing a Montana version of
its Trans Sport minivan with television ads showing cowboys riding
alongside in scenes similar to those in sport utility ads. Soon,
Pontiac eliminated the Trans Sport name and now sells all its
minivans as Montanas, trying to elude the ``soccer mom'' image of
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   On the bottom foot or so of the sides of the Montana, Pontiac
offers taupe- or charcoal-colored plastic cladding _ a feature
commonly used on $40,000 sport utilities to make them seem
utilitarian, even if they are seldom driven off-road. But while
Chrysler minivans have long had scuff-resistant plastic cladding,
too, it will stay the same color as the rest of the vehicle, making
it virtually invisible to anyone not looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Chrysler's market researchers concluded that
minivans and sport utilities were really two separate markets.
Holden said the soccer-mom image had been inescapably associated
with the minivan ever since the first advertising campaign in 1983,
which presented the vehicle as an alternative to the station wagon
for families with children. ``We pitched it like that, fairy dust
and kids, in the first ads touting it as a `magic wagon,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While buyers of sport utility vehicles are mainly concerned with
a vehicle's image, minivan buyers do not even put the exterior
styling in the top 10 reasons for their purchase, said David
Bostwick, Chrysler's director of market research. By an
overwhelming margin, he said, minivan buyers focus instead on how
functional and flexible the vehicle's interior will be for hauling
people and their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, circling the Town &AMP; Country in the design dome,
bridled when told of Bostwick's comment. The market researchers do
not ask the right questions to determine the importance of exterior
styling, he said, contending that minivan buyers' overall image of
their vehicles is shaped by first impressions _ formed before they
ever step inside.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around the back of the Town &AMP; Country, he cheerfully
demonstrated the vehicle's most distinctive new feature: a powered
rear liftgate. It opens when he pushes the button on a remote
control key fob, beeping as it rises to warn anyone nearby. Then
McKinnon stands warily below the liftgate and pushes the button
again; the liftgate begins to close automatically but stops
instantly when it touches the top of his head and rises again. ``It
worked,'' he says, jokingly pretending to be relieved.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But inside the rear liftgate is one of the most important
features that Chrysler left little changed: the third row of seats.
The 110-pound row is still designed to be rolled out the back of
the vehicle when not needed and stored in the owner's garage. An
option this year is for the seat to come in two rollable 55-pound
pieces. But it does not fold down flat into a compartment in the
vehicle, like the fold-away third row in the Honda Odyssey, which
ranks a distant third in sales but is gaining on Chrysler faster
than any other brand.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon wrestles with the Town &AMP; Country's third row in an
unsuccessful effort to remove it; such features commonly do not
work in early prototypes. (The seats are designed to roll out,
although the task usually requires two people, as in Chrysler's
current minivans.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prototype's difficulty, Chrysler's minivans are the
only such vehicles produced by Detroit automakers to be recommended
by Consumer Reports magazine, which harshly judges the reliability
of most American-made vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas G. Elliott, the executive vice president for auto
operations in Honda's North American unit, said Odyssey buyers gave
higher marks to the fold-away seat than any other feature. GM's
Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Montana will
offer fold-away seats beginning this fall. And Townsend said Ford
was working to develop a fold-away seat for the Windstar as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph A. Sarotte, the general manager of Chrysler's minivan
operations, said the company had rejected fold-away seats after
finding that the space for folding them down could function as a
hollow drum, amplifying road noise and making it difficult for
passengers to hear one another. The new Chrysler minivans are much
quieter inside than competitors' models because they have
traditional rear seats, Sarotte said.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors question this compromise between noise and
convenience. ``I was floored with the '01 Chrysler, that they
didn't touch those seats,'' said Fred J. Schaafsma, a top GM
vehicle development executive who oversaw minivans until early this
summer. ``That was a horrible trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the design dome, McKinnon moved to the passenger side of
the Town &AMP; Country and pointed to the front overhang, the distance
from the wheels to the front of the bumper. The larger headlights
make this overhang look short, he said, but it is actually an inch
longer now.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of a vehicle's front overhang length to its weight is
the main consideration in determining a vehicle's performance in
the federal government's crash tests, which involve hurling a
vehicle at 35 mph into a concrete wall. Lightweight vehicles with
very long hoods tend to do best in the tests, while heavy vehicles
with short hoods often allow severe damage to the dummies inside.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler officials concede that even with the extra inch, the
fairly short overhang on their minivans will likely mean that they
receive four stars for frontal crash safety in the government
tests, compared with the top rating of five earned by the Windstar,
Sienna and Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   But Chrysler could not increase the front overhang without
lengthening the vehicle, which would have made it harder to park,
or moving the front tires back in the vehicle, which likely would
have reduced the interior room. Either step would have involved an
expensive redesign of the vehicle's underbody, which remains little
changed from the previous generation. Either would also have
required the replacement of considerable factory equipment, which
would have caused a costly delay before the first production of the
new models.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler chose a modest increase in the front overhang. ``To
improve that rating, you have to put more body in front of the
wheels,'' Rinschler said. ``You make the vehicle longer, heavier
and, to my eyes, less attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinschler and other executives contend that government crash
tests are an imperfect measure of how vehicles actually perform in
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chrysler's current minivans, which also have four-star
ratings, have slightly below-average death rates for their drivers
compared with other minivans, and minivans as a group have a lower
death rate for their drivers than any other type of vehicle,
according to insurance industry data. But when the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, an insurance industry trade group,
did its own crash test of the current minivans, it gave them an
overall rating of ``marginal'' and found that they permitted ``the
likelihood of significant injury to both legs,'' a problem for
vehicles with short front overhangs.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has heavily advertised the Windstar's five-star rating.
Bostwick questioned whether the difference between four and five
stars would influence customers; regulators acknowledge that the
difference is sometimes small. A four-star rating indicates an 11
percent to 20 percent chance of a life-threatening injury in a
crash at 35 mph with a similar vehicle or a fixed object, while a
five-star rating means a chance of 10 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an overwhelming issue _ they're all safe vehicles,''
Bostwick said. ``Between the four and the five, it's something to
talk about, but it's not going to change someone's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the design dome, McKinnon added up the changes and declared
that Chrysler had done what it set out to do: to freshen but not
overhaul a vehicle that continues to sell very well. But throughout
the process, he said, the company's designers remembered one lesson
learned over the years from rivals: ``Competitors would try
something to be different, and when they went too far, the
customers would walk on them.''

citizens cast ballots, the first time in more than 70 years that
less than half of voters went to the polls. Yet despite voter
apathy, Americans say they are more satisfied with their choice of
presidential candidates this year and they are less critical of the

the tire store where my Cousin Bubba works, waiting on him to get
off for lunch and listening to a couple of fellows talking about
haying. You might not think that hay means much to you, personally,
and maybe it doesn't. Maybe you're somebody who doesn't care much,
personally, about a good hamburger. Hay just happens to be the main
ingredient, lower down the food chain, for hamburgers, not to
mention thick, juicy steaks. So, if you're going to have meat on
the table, somewhere you have to have beef on the hoof and hay on
the ground. (Joe Murray, Cox News Service). MOVED.

 &HT;    Finding a safe place for babies
 &HT;    By Gaiutra Bahadur
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With a little-known law passed last year,
lawmakers placed Texas at the forefront of a national movement to
allow mothers to abandon their babies in ``safe havens'' such as
hospitals and fire stations without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Now state officials want to step up the public's knowledge of
the law and let desperate mothers know they have alternatives to
leaving their children in Dumpsters or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since Texas passed the so-called Baby Moses law, 11 states have
followed in its footsteps. Another 24 are interested. And
television crews from as far away as Germany and Australia have
come calling.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble is, since the law took effect last September,
no babies have been left with emergency medical personnel at
hospitals or fire departments, the protected spheres created by the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ says Rep. Geanie Morrison, R-Victoria, sponsor of
the legislation _ is that no money was appropriated in the budget
for a media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Land Commissioner David Dewhurst, who has provided
hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own pocket to create and
air a public service announcement to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believe the best place for a baby is with the mother,''
Dewhurst said at the unveiling of the TV spot Thursday at Austin
Fire Department Headquarters. ``But if a young, scared mother can't
do the best thing for a baby, for heaven's sake, do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ad opens with a shot of a trash bin, the vista for
a teen-age girl who says in a quivering voice: ``I was desperate. I
mean, I knew I couldn't keep it. I didn't have anywhere to go. . .
. I didn't want to do it. It was all I could think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, a female narrator offers the grim statistics: 800 babies
are abandoned every year in Texas, 50 are left to die in Dumpsters.
She explains the safe haven law. one life is saved, it would be an
investment in which we can all take pride,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, Dewhurst has also provided some of the
greenbacks to elevate the Baby Moses Project, an informal crusader
for the law outside Texas run by a Morrison aide, into a nonprofit
foundation to educate pregnant women about the alternatives to
infant abandonment. He is the honorary chairman. Morrison is
president.
</P>
<P>
   But one critic of the law adopted in Texas, a California-based
nonprofit called Project Cuddle whose members have tread the same
talk-show circuit as supporters of the Baby Moses Project, said
that publicity is not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's government,'' said Debbe Magnusen, the founder and
director of Project Cuddle. ``The girls we work with are scared of
government. They're afraid of officials. . . . They deny a lot of
stuff. They haven't told their families. They haven't told their
best friends. Why would they go to a facility with a camera?''
</P>
<P>
   Promotions of the Texas law have included billboards in Houston
and appearances by the law's supporters on ``The Montel Williams
Show,'' ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' CNN's ``Crossfire'' and NBC's
``Dateline'' over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Magnusen said that the defensive mindset of pregnant teen-agers,
rather than their ignorance of the law, explains why no one has
taken advantage of the Baby Moses protections.
</P>
<P>
   There are two known cases of mothers who almost did.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a baby girl was left swaddled in a pink towel on
the floor next to a toilet at a Houston hospital. And in May, a
baby boy was abandoned at a covered bus stop on the edge of a Plano
hospital's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as close as she felt she could go,'' Magnusen said.
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed to a loophole in the law.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas County and District Attorneys
Association, the law doesn't prevent district attorneys from
pursuing abandonment cases. It gives a mother ``an affirmative
defense'' _ which means that if she can prove she gave her baby to
an emergency services provider, she will not be found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every case turns on its own facts,'' said the association's
general counsel, Rob Kepple. ``You don't have prosecutors running
around and promising they won't prosecute. (But) the very terms of
the law make it unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the other states that have passed laws, most have gone a
little further than Texas, according to the National Conference of
State Legislators.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey appropriated $500,000 to promote its law.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's law broaches the issue of mothers who change their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's and South Carolina's versions address fathers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   And Florida goes as far as discussing genetic testing to
establish paternity.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said that, by helping other states craft their laws,
the Baby Moses Project has become aware of ways to refine and
improve the Texas law and that all of them are under consideration.

&HT;     DEMOCRATS MAKE ISSUE OF SQUALID VILLAGES IN BUSH'S BACK YARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 16)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are making impoverished shantytowns in
South Texas an issue in the presidential race, challenging Gov.
George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' mantle and accusing
him of neglecting issues that affect Hispanics and the poor in his
own state.
</P>
<P>
   The squalor of the border shantytowns that dot the U.S. side of
the Rio Grande is vividly shown in a videotape produced by
Democrats to underscore their criticisms of Bush's record on
education, health care and minority issues in Texas. These
``colonias,'' the Spanish name for villages, are illegal
subdivisions that often lack running water, sewage systems and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Bush's negligence and inaction, schoolchildren in
the colonias live in perpetual poverty,'' said Rep. Loretta Sanchez
of California, a co-chair of the Democratic National Committee
(DNC).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that the DNC is serving as a surrogate on
the issue for Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and the national Democrats have an active campaign to
trash the state of Texas,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign
spokesman in Austin. ``In doing so, they not only insult Democratic
and Republican leaders in our state, but also the citizens of our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the criticism is related to Democratic
efforts to protect their base and blunt Bush's push for votes among
Hispanics and minorities, who do not traditionally support
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is ``attempting to spin out a record'' of helping the
poor, the Gore campaign and the Democrats are trying to saddle the
Texas governor with all the blame for the conditions in the
colonias, said Garth Jowett, University of Houston Communications
Department director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception is better than reality,'' Jowett said of the
tactics being used by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   It's a timeworn practice in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Vice President George Bush _ the Texas governor's
father _ used Boston Harbor pollution and the prison furlough of
convicted killer Willie Horton to paint Michael Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential hopeful, as an
ineffective leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly tarnished his image as governor,'' said William
G. Mayer, a political scientist at Northeastern University in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said the campaign strategy was to raise questions about
Dukakis' effectiveness ``and blunt any challenges he might raise
about the environmental record of the Reagan-Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horton issue and others were raised, Mayer said, ``to very
specifically focus on Dukakis' attempt to portray himself as a
moderate and to suggest that he was a liberal who had adopted these
traditional liberal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has launched an aggressive effort to portray himself as a
moderate and to reach out to minorities. He has delivered speeches
to the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza and the League of
United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).
</P>
<P>
   The governor's message has been to welcome blacks and Hispanics
into a ``big-tent'' Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's venture into Hispanic territory has received a warm
reception.
</P>
<P>
   He received applause last month when he told the LULAC national
convention that education initiatives in Texas were breaking down
the racial bigotry of low expectations and helping minority
students receive a better public school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysis says we are making great progress. Our state has
set high standards,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His critics assert that his message is poll-driven.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Battleground 2000 poll conducted for Voter.com
found that while Bush had the support of a majority of whites,
blacks overwhelmingly support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held a double-digit lead over Bush among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Celinda Lake, a Democrat, predicted Gore would
``steadily gain'' support from Hispanics as the election nears. But
even Democrats concede Bush has made surprising inroads in that
demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said Bush's support from Hispanics
is the highest a GOP presidential candidate has polled since Ronald
Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Bush solidifying his base on the right, the
governor is using the weeks before the Republican National
Convention to target new voters who have traditionally remained in
the Democratic column. His message of compassionate conservatism
speaks of improving education, health care and economic
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the colonias show that reality doesn't match the
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that during his six years in the Governor's
Mansion, Bush has never visited a colonia.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan did not deny the claim, but said the governor has
visited ``barrios'' and poor communities in the state, unlike some
of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has spent a great deal of time in the border
region, effectively addressing border-related issues,'' Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington last month, state Sen. Mario
Gallegos of Houston blasted Bush for vetoing a bill to streamline
procedures for state agencies and help improve conditions in the
colonias, which house roughly 400,000 Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded that he signed a measure designed to remove
barriers that impeded state and local efforts to improve conditions
in the colonias, including a lifting of regulatory language to
expedite individual water and sewer connections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush signed a bill to provide $5.6 million in
low-interest loans to help colonia residents improve their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot speak out of both ends of your mouth,'' Gallegos
said. ``The truth needs to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC videotape shows residents living in Third World
conditions, dilapidated shacks and unpaved streets. The five-minute
tape shows ramshackle homes made of plywood and tin, an outhouse
and refuse strewn about unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
   It details the lack of electricity, running water and sewage
systems in a colonia outside the city of San Juan in the lower Rio
Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the tape have been made available to public
television. It was broadcast nationally on CNN's ``Inside
Politics.''

   A DNC news release quotes a 1998 study by former Texas
Comptroller John Sharp that shows the 43-county Texas border area
as the poorest region in the country, and another report that ranks
Texas 49th among states for children without health insurance, 1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also ranked 49th for children living in poverty, the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about compassion and turn your back on the
colonias,'' said Jenny Backus, a DNC spokeswoman. ``He's saying
he's a different kind of Republican who will work to reduce
poverty. His record doesn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Sullivan: ``This attack is another symptom of what's
wrong with Washington and Al Gore's Washington-style politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the Bush campaign is
trying to sidestep a legitimate debate that affects the rural
reaches of South Texas, as well as its urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush labels everything as negative campaigning if someone has
a different opinion,'' Gonzalez said. ``Once we get past that
smokescreen, then we have the right to question whether the emperor
has no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all Texans and we are proud of our state. But we are
realists, and we realize we fall short for the poorest people of
our state.''

GERMAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Bowing to the competitive pressures
sweeping across Europe, Germany's left-of-center parliament passed
a radical tax program Friday that will slash rates and should also
unleash a wave of restructuring in ``Germany Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a remarkable and unexpected victory for Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who began his
career as a long-haired student protester but whose tax plan made
him a hero of the corporate elite.
</P>
<P>
   In a role-reversal worthy of Lewis Carroll, Schroeder received
extensive lobbying support from German corporations, as well as
from U.S. businesses here, and overwhelmed the usually pro-business
party, the Christian Democratic Union. It fought the bill for
political reasons, and criticized it as too limited.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the law will reduce crushing tax rates for individuals
and corporations by a total of 50 billion marks, or $24 billion a
year. The top tax rates for individuals will drop, to 42 percent,
from 51 percent, and the overall corporate burden is expected to
decline to 40 percent, from 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking change, however, is a provision that will let
corporations sell subsidiaries or shares in other companies without
paying any tax on their profits. That change is expected to
revolutionize the structure of German business, because it clears
the way for the big banks and insurance companies to sell over $100
billion in shares of industrial companies like DaimlerChrysler and
Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old structure of ``Germany Inc.,'' those crossholdings
created a web of mutual support that helped finance Germany's
spectacular economic recovery after World War II. But now, with
companies dependent on satisfying the performance demands set by
investors on Wall Street or in London, banks and manufacturers
argue that the tangled ownership has become an obstacle to
restructuring and a drag on profits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet selling the stakes was almost impossible under current law,
because selling companies would be charged a 50 percent tax on tens
of billions of dollars of profit from shares that they might have
held for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and corporate executives say the combined effect of
the changes will be to transform Germany, which is Europe's biggest
economy but one that has been growing slowly. Some of the changes
will take effect next year, and Elga Bartsch, economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, estimated that the law would increase German
growth then to 3.1 percent, from 2.6 percent. Norbert Walter, chief
economist for Deutsche Bank, predicts that growth will exceed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important signal to investors, because here you
have a government of Social Democrats and Greens that has passed a
very business-oriented tax reform,'' Walter said Friday. The
pro-business political trend is apparent across Europe, he added,
even where left-of-center parties control the biggest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is the catalyst,'' Walter said, referring to the
single currency that has now been adopted by 12 countries. ``It is
the catalytic effect of a truly internal market that has now pushed
the laggards toward the more advanced countries in terms of
modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder came into office two years ago dependent politically
on the left-wing leader of his party, Oskar Lafontaine. But since
the two men had a falling out a year ago, Schroeder has steered his
party in a more pro-business direction. As recently as Wednesday,
most experts were convinced that Schroeder would be blocked in the
upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, by the Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder steamrolled over Christian Democrats on the right
and disgruntled left-wing traditionalists in his own party, showing
a self-assurance and readiness for conflict that were missing when
he first came to power in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats argued that the tax plan failed to
provide enough relief to small and medium-sized companies, but
their primary goal seemed to be to stymie Schroeder, whose Social
Democrats blocked a Christian Democrat tax plan three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder lashed back by promising over $1 billion in sweeteners
to small companies as well as to states where political leaders
were wavering.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded the Christian Democratic leader of Berlin to defect
to his side, by promising 75 million marks for more police officers
and 25 million marks to renovate the city's Museum Island. And he
got leaders from the impoverished eastern state Mecklenburg-West
Pomerania to go along, by cutting a deal with state's neocommunist
Party of Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   That party, successor to the old East German Communist Party, is
a minority partner of the state's governing coalition and normally
no friend of corporate Germany. But Schroeder received its support
after he promised to support construction of a highly subsidized
power plant in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents protested fruitlessly that Schroeder was using
government money to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not experienced this sort of abuse of a constitutional
branch of government in 30 years,'' thundered Hans Jochen Vogel,
the Christian Democratic governor of Thuringia. But Angela Merkel,
chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, seemed cowed by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to the process, Schroeder was clearly the
winner,'' she said glumly at a news conference Friday.
``Maintaining unity proved to be much thornier and more difficult
than many people had thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, grinning broadly after the vote, brushed aside the
criticism as ``hypocrisy'' and said the plan would be good for
business as well as for individuals by leaving them more money in
their pockets. ``This is truly a good day for Germany,'' Schroeder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors generally agreed. The DAX index of blue-chip German
stocks jumped 2 percent after the vote and financial institutions
ended considerably higher. Shares of Allianz AG, the insurance
conglomerate that is perhaps at the center of German
cross-holdings, jumped 7 percent to 395.65 euros. Shares of
Dresdner Bank jumped 5.6 percent and Deutsche Bank rose 3.36
percent.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But economists also said that the law's effects could reach well
beyond Germany. Foreign investors, including many corporate buyout
funds from the United States, are scouring Germany for companies to
buy, spruce up and sell for a profit years later.
</P>
<P>
   Merger-and-acquisition activity, already torrid, is expected to
soar as the tax provision on selling corporate holdings takes
effect in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, which has been an adviser in many of
Germany's biggest mergers, is hiring hundreds of new executives and
leasing eleven new floors in one of Frankfurt's biggest
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies were unusually active in lobbying for passage of
the bill. Representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Germany, based in Frankfurt, visited officials from several German
states that were wavering in their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the signal we get from Germany,''
said Norbert Quinkert, executive vice president of the Chamber and
chairman of Motorola Deutschland. ``It wasn't important whether the
top tax rate was 42 percent or 43 percent. The issue was whether a
tax reform could be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartsch, of Morgan Stanley, argued that the German tax package
would put pressure on countries like France and Italy to cut their
taxes. ``This is a very big country with very high corporate tax
rates, which has allowed neighboring countries to hide behind a
shield,'' said Bartsch.

MANDELA CLOSES AIDS CONFERENCE WITH CALL TO MOVE BEYOND
CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to corrects slug; no other changes)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Closing the 13th International Aids
Conference Friday, Nelson Mandela urged scientists to move beyond
their concerns about South Africa's president and to focus on
combating the epidemic that is raging across the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech punctuated by repeated applause, Mandela said the
world could not afford to be distracted by the furor surrounding
President Thabo Mbeki, his successor, who has questioned whether
HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela did not clarify Mbeki's views on the subject, but told
his audience that Mbeki was committed to fighting the sickness in
South Africa, the country with the largest number of people
infected with the AIDS virus, 4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much unnecessary attention around this conference had been
directed toward a dispute that is unintentionally distracting from
the real life-and-death issues we are confronted with as a country,
a region, a continent and a world,'' said Mandela, who handed over
the reigns of power to Mbeki one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of the grave threat posed by HIV/AIDS, we have to
rise above our differences and combine our efforts to save our
people,'' he said. ``History will judge us harshly if we fail to do
so, and right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech marked the end of the first international AIDS
conference to be held in a developing country. About 34 million
people, most of them in Africa, are infected with HIV. And this
week, scientists debated the best ways to battle the scourge,
finding hope in studies that suggest circumcision reduces the risk
of infection and disappointment in a report that questions the
long-term benefit of a drug intended to protect newborns from the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   But the many scientific developments announced here were almost
overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Mbeki. He addressed the
conference only once, in the opening speech on Sunday, when he
singled out extreme poverty, rather than AIDS, as the biggest
killer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and conference halls at the convention
center here, the president dominated conversations nearly as much
as the talk about future vaccines. Last week, the scientific
magazine Nature published a declaration signed by 5,000 scientists
from around the world who described the link between HIV and AIDS
as ``clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week, in panel after panel, scientists and activists
criticized Mbeki, who stirred the debate by consulting with two
U.S. researchers who argue that poverty and malnutrition, not HIV,
cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the link between poverty and AIDS, which is well
established. And government officials here emphasize that Mbeki has
never said that HIV did not cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers fear that Mbeki's heavy emphasis on poverty and
his talks with AIDS dissidents may fuel confusion among ordinary
people who may assume they can engage in risky sexual behavior
because the president has raised questions about HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed, to put it bluntly,'' Roy Anderson, a
prominent AIDS researcher, said this week of Mbeki's speech. ``In
South Africa, it's really such an acute problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly lashed back. Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang dismissed the criticism and accused the media of
distorting Mbeki's message. She insisted that the president was
committed to fighting the disease by encouraging safe sex and by
sponsoring research on drug therapies and a possible vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he deny something he has not said?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mandela also defended Mbeki. He called him ``a man of
great intellect'' and emphasized that he ``continues to place this
issue on the top of the national and continental agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela acknowledged that the government, under his leadership
and Mbeki's, had fallen short in its efforts to fight the disease.
Scientists and AIDS activists have repeatedly accused South African
leaders of a lack of leadership in combating the epidemic. In 1993,
HIV infected 4 percent of South Africa's adult population. Now the
figure is 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will, with me, be the first to concede that much more
remains to be done,'' Mandela said. ``I do not doubt for one moment
that he will proceed to tackle this task with the resolve and
dedication he is known for.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela did differ with Mbeki on some points. For instance, he
emphasized his reluctance to engage in the scientific debate,
saying he lacked adequate knowledge to contribute seriously.
Several scientists and commentators have criticized Mbeki for
delving so deeply into an issue in which he lacks expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mbeki has questioned the safety of AIDS drugs, Mandela
stressed the urgency of using them to reduce the transmission of
the virus from mothers to newborns, saying such measures ``have
been proven to be essential.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mandela, who walked slowly and stiffly to the microphone,
leavened his speech with humor and populism, reminding his audience
not to forget the ordinary people who live with the disease. And
several delegates said they were cheered by his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if he had anticipated a feeling in the audience,
that this was becoming a hindrance to our making progress,'' said
Benon Biryahwaho, a virologist from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Remie Rwankote, an immunologist in Britain,
nodded in agreement, saying the speech left him with hope for South
Africa. ``We think they are ready to act,'' he said.

&HT;     DEMOCRATS MAKE ISSUE OF SQUALID VILLAGES IN BUSH'S BACK YARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 16)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are making impoverished shantytowns in
South Texas an issue in the presidential race, challenging Gov.
George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' mantle and accusing
him of neglecting issues that affect Hispanics and the poor in his
own state.
</P>
<P>
   The squalor of the border shantytowns that dot the U.S. side of
the Rio Grande is vividly shown in a videotape produced by
Democrats to underscore their criticisms of Bush's record on
education, health care and minority issues in Texas. These
``colonias,'' the Spanish name for villages, are illegal
subdivisions that often lack running water, sewage systems and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Bush's negligence and inaction, schoolchildren in
the colonias live in perpetual poverty,'' said Rep. Loretta Sanchez
of California, a co-chair of the Democratic National Committee
(DNC).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that the DNC is serving as a surrogate on
the issue for Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and the national Democrats have an active campaign to
trash the state of Texas,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign
spokesman in Austin. ``In doing so, they not only insult Democratic
and Republican leaders in our state, but also the citizens of our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the criticism is related to Democratic
efforts to protect their base and blunt Bush's push for votes among
Hispanics and minorities, who do not traditionally support
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is ``attempting to spin out a record'' of helping the
poor, the Gore campaign and the Democrats are trying to saddle the
Texas governor with all the blame for the conditions in the
colonias, said Garth Jowett, University of Houston Communications
Department director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception is better than reality,'' Jowett said of the
tactics being used by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   It's a timeworn practice in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Vice President George Bush _ the Texas governor's
father _ used Boston Harbor pollution and the prison furlough of
convicted killer Willie Horton to paint Michael Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential hopeful, as an
ineffective leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly tarnished his image as governor,'' said William
G. Mayer, a political scientist at Northeastern University in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said the campaign strategy was to raise questions about
Dukakis' effectiveness ``and blunt any challenges he might raise
about the environmental record of the Reagan-Bush administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horton issue and others were raised, Mayer said, ``to very
specifically focus on Dukakis' attempt to portray himself as a
moderate and to suggest that he was a liberal who had adopted these
traditional liberal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has launched an aggressive effort to portray himself as a
moderate and to reach out to minorities. He has delivered speeches
to the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza and the League of
United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).
</P>
<P>
   The governor's message has been to welcome blacks and Hispanics
into a ``big-tent'' Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's venture into Hispanic territory has received a warm
reception.
</P>
<P>
   He received applause last month when he told the LULAC national
convention that education initiatives in Texas were breaking down
the racial bigotry of low expectations and helping minority
students receive a better public school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analysis says we are making great progress. Our state has
set high standards,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His critics assert that his message is poll-driven.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Battleground 2000 poll conducted for Voter.com
found that while Bush had the support of a majority of whites,
blacks overwhelmingly support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also held a double-digit lead over Bush among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Celinda Lake, a Democrat, predicted Gore would
``steadily gain'' support from Hispanics as the election nears. But
even Democrats concede Bush has made surprising inroads in that
demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said Bush's support from Hispanics
is the highest a GOP presidential candidate has polled since Ronald
Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Bush solidifying his base on the right, the
governor is using the weeks before the Republican National
Convention to target new voters who have traditionally remained in
the Democratic column. His message of compassionate conservatism
speaks of improving education, health care and economic
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the colonias show that reality doesn't match the
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that during his six years in the Governor's
Mansion, Bush has never visited a colonia.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan did not deny the claim, but said the governor has
visited ``barrios'' and poor communities in the state, unlike some
of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has spent a great deal of time in the border
region, effectively addressing border-related issues,'' Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington last month, state Sen. Mario
Gallegos of Houston blasted Bush for vetoing a bill to streamline
procedures for state agencies and help improve conditions in the
colonias, which house roughly 400,000 Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded that he signed a measure designed to remove
barriers that impeded state and local efforts to improve conditions
in the colonias, including a lifting of regulatory language to
expedite individual water and sewer connections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush signed a bill to provide $5.6 million in
low-interest loans to help colonia residents improve their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot speak out of both ends of your mouth,'' Gallegos
said. ``The truth needs to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC videotape shows residents living in Third World
conditions, dilapidated shacks and unpaved streets. The five-minute
tape shows ramshackle homes made of plywood and tin, an outhouse
and refuse strewn about unpaved roads.
</P>
<P>
   It details the lack of electricity, running water and sewage
systems in a colonia outside the city of San Juan in the lower Rio
Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the tape have been made available to public
television. It was broadcast nationally on CNN's ``Inside
Politics.''

   A DNC news release quotes a 1998 study by former Texas
Comptroller John Sharp that shows the 43-county Texas border area
as the poorest region in the country, and another report that ranks
Texas 49th among states for children without health insurance, 1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also ranked 49th for children living in poverty, the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about compassion and turn your back on the
colonias,'' said Jenny Backus, a DNC spokeswoman. ``He's saying
he's a different kind of Republican who will work to reduce
poverty. His record doesn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Sullivan: ``This attack is another symptom of what's
wrong with Washington and Al Gore's Washington-style politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the Bush campaign is
trying to sidestep a legitimate debate that affects the rural
reaches of South Texas, as well as its urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush labels everything as negative campaigning if someone has
a different opinion,'' Gonzalez said. ``Once we get past that
smokescreen, then we have the right to question whether the emperor
has no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all Texans and we are proud of our state. But we are
realists, and we realize we fall short for the poorest people of
our state.''

&HT;     ANOTHER NEW TWIST IN MEXICAN POLITICS: JOB-SEEKERS MUST APPLY

   MEXICO CITY _ Help Wanted: Men and women to form new Mexican
government. Requirements: Love of Mexico, sense of social
responsibility, honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Days after he became president-elect of Mexico, Vicente Fox
dispatched headhunters to search for candidates who will shape the
new Cabinet before he takes office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect has shocked many traditional Mexicans with
his business-oriented method to government. But he has also
delighted others who would otherwise not have a shot to serve their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's approach is not the way the business of government has
traditionally been conducted under the 71-year rule of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which was
soundly defeated in the July 2 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Previous PRI governments consisted mostly of appointed friends
or relatives to those occupying the nation's highest posts,
sometimes without regard to qualification.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who ran under the banner of the pro-business,
conservative National Action Party, is not the run-of-the-mill
politician. The rancher who governed Guanajuato state was also
president of Coca-Cola in Mexico, and he is a whiz at successful
marketing in a country that slurps the soft drink like water.
</P>
<P>
   A believer of ``symbols,'' he marketed himself during the
campaign, wearing his cowboy boots, a huge belt buckle emblazoned
with ``Fox'' in silver, a blue shirt for his party's colors and a
trademark wave to supporters _ ``V'' for Vicente.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, a reserved
economist and veteran public servant, Fox had a swaggering image
that stood out with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this country needs is a rancher with guts, not an
intellectual,'' said office worker Martin Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzwords Fox uses to describe his future government are
``quality'' and ``clients.'' Under the Fox dogma, clients are
Mexican citizens and his government will be a quality product.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Fox issued a lofty, five-point standard, published in
newspapers, that must be met by applicants to work in his
administration. They must have: ``Love of Mexico, high sense of
responsibility, proven honesty, recognized capabilities and be able
to obtain results.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he is looking for men and women from all backgrounds
and differing political affiliations. When he governed Guanajuato
state, the top financial post went to a longtime PRI member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have commitments with no one, I don't appoint members of my
family. I don't bring teams I worked with on other projects,'' Fox
said this week in a late-night talk show on the TV Azteca network.
``The decisions I am going to make in the next two months will mark
the destiny of my six-year term.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would have his new government in place within two
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, headhunters are combing Mexico and are even
searching for Mexicans living in the United States to fill vital
jobs. Fox himself will conduct interviews and do the hiring of the
tops Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be assured that this Cabinet has two things:
experience, maturity, and, on the other hand, be like these yuppies
revolutionizing the world and making frog leaps to the process of
development,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dressed in basic black, her shoulder-length hair pulled back,
Lucy Villamar, 35, might fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations consultant, who has directed projects at
several museums, found out the name of one of the headhunters and
boldly gave him a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were surprised, but I was confident. I know there will be
a change because Fox said he would give opportunities to all
Mexicans,'' said Villamar, who wants to work with the Ministry of
Culture or a related post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique opportunity. I never would have had this chance
with the PRI because they put their friends in,'' added Villamar,
who said she voted for Fox. ``He said he would take into account
talent. Fox believes in women and the young. I see an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   While Villamar sees an opening, others are grumbling. This week,
the media had a field day, carping on Fox's headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governing a nation is not the same as selling Coca-Cola,''
Reforma newspaper columnist Rafael Segovia wrote on Friday.
``Putting an ad in a newspaper to obtain ministerial candidates
tells us a lot about Fox's concept in the art of governing. Like it
or not, it is the activity of an elite.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, 58, has already broken the Mexican presidential mold in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he the first opposition leader since the PRI was
founded in 1929, he will also be the nation's first divorced
president and the father of four adopted children. And he has an
Irish surname and a mother who was born in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thursday meeting with international news agencies, Fox
revealed his plans to appoint seven close advisers _ ``czars who
will demand results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be the czar of corruption, poverty, Indians, the
economy, education and social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly won't spend much time in the office. I'll leave
the work to them,'' if he has a good team, Fox said, adding he
wants to travel throughout Mexico finding out what people want and
how government can help.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would meet once a week with his Cabinet to plan the
next week's work.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions Mexico, a poor nation bordering a powerful United
States, as Spain was after the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in
1975: a flagging economy surrounded by European giants.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of August, plans to travel to Washington to meet with
President Clinton. Among Fox's long-term goals is to make the
tightly guarded U.S.-Mexico border as open as the one between the
U.S. and Canada.

AMID INTIMIDATION, ABORTIONS DWINDLE IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A campaign of violence and intimidation
against doctors who perform abortions has succeeded in shutting
down Canadian abortion clinics and frightening physicians so
effectively that the procedure is becoming extremely difficult to
obtain in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Police in British Columbia this week warned doctors providing
abortions to go on ``high alert'' after Dr. Garson Romalis, a
63-year-old gynecologist, was stabbed outside his Vancouver clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which police say was almost certainly the act of an
antiabortion extremist, marked the second attempt on Romalis's life
_ in 1994, he was ambushed and seriously wounded by the notorious
``abortion sniper,'' a rifleman from Vermont whom the FBI and Royal
Canadian Mounted Police are seeking in connection with five
shootings on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, threats were made against the life of Dr. Ellen
Wiebe, the physician leading Canadian tests of the French abortion
pill RU-486. ``All of us abortion providers in North America must
live with fear,'' Wiebe said.
</P>
<P>
   Even high-profile abortion advocates concede that fear among
doctors has become so pervasive that the procedure is becoming
almost unobtainable in Canada outside major urban centers in
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors in smaller places have succumbed to the pressure,''
said Dr. Henry Morgantaler, a Toronto gynecologist who is Canada's
best-known abortion rights activist. ``They don't want to become
the target of some crazy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws restricting abortion were overthrown by the Canadian
Supreme Court in 1988, mainly as the result of challenges brought
by Morgantaler.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issue rarely triggers the sort of raw public
emotion in Canada that it does in the United States, this country
is loathed by abortion foes because it places no legal constraints
on when a pregnancy may be terminated _ in theory, a woman can get
an abortion up to the moment of birth. Canadian courts have ruled
that a fetus at any stage of development has no rights.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, US antiabortion groups are increasingly
engaging in direct antiabortion crusades north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The protests and threats have been aimed largely at Canadian
physicians and medical students. As one result, abortion advocates
say, the numbers of doctors willing to terminate preganancies has
declined dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is going down, fewer and fewer young doctors are
willing to provide abortion services, and fear is a big part of the
reason,'' said Cyndy Recker, spokeswoman for the Ottawa-based
Canadian Abortion Rights Action League. ``Antiabortion groups,
including very extremist elements from the US, are contacting
students in Canadian medical schools, saying, `If you do abortions,
you are going to be in danger.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the most withering effect on Canadian physicians has been
the series of highly-publicized sniper attacks on abortion doctors
_ beginning with the shooting of Romalis six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis, then 57, was waiting for bread to pop from the toaster
in the kitchen of his suburban Vancouver home when two high-powered
7.62mm rifle slugs smashed through the window. One tore into his
thigh, shattering the bone and severing an artery. Even with a
makeshift tourniquet fashioned from his bathrobe belt, he nearly
bled to death on the linoleum floor.
</P>
<P>
   Four more rifle attacks in Canada and the United States,
including the 1998 assassination of an upstate New York doctor who
performed abortions, Barnett Slepian, are believed by the FBI and
Canadian police to be the work of James Charles Kopp, a 45-year-old
abortion foe whose last known address was in northern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing of Romalis on Tuesday is thought to be directly
linked to his abortion practice but not to the earlier shooting.
The physician remained listed in good condition Friday in a
Vancouver hospital under heavy police guard. His attacker,
described as a white man in his 20s, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion specialists say that most doctors still providing
abortion in Canada are older practitioners, like Romalis, nearing
retirement age _ and only a handful of younger doctors are taking
their place.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in some parts of Canada have become so reluctant to
provide the procedure _ or even make referrals _ that abortion is
becoming almost unobtainable except to women willing to travel
hundreds of miles to big cities or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Edward Island forbids provincial hospitals from providing
abortion, and access to the procedure is extremely limited in Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The number of
private clinics specializing in abortions has fallen to 30 across
Canada, almost all concentrated in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver,
and two or three other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fear among gynecologists is so high that many ask
colleagues and professional associations not to give out their
names even as professional referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a strange way, it's come back to the days when abortion was
a black market job, done in back rooms on the hush-hush'' said a
Quebec doctor, asking that her name not be used. ``If you have a
pregnant teenager or some other woman who feels she needs an
abortion, you kind of call around, saying, `Pssst, do you know
anyone?' ''

BURNS' 10-PART `JAZZ' GOES WELL BEYOND THE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Ken Burns is back.
</P>
<P>
   The one-man history channel brings his 10-part,
18-and-a-half-hour film ``Jazz'' to PBS in January, completing a
trilogy of American life that started with ``The Civil War'' and
continued with ``Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As only Burns can do in his erudite populist style that defies
contradiction, he declared: ``Jazz is ... a glimpse into the inner
workings of the democratic ideal and the redemptive future
possibilities of this extraordinary but by no means perfect
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it's also toe-tappingly enjoyable music. But will
America sit still for 18-plus hours of ``Jazz?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are enough people out there that will be moved
and, I think, quite satisfied by what we've done and probably be
hungry for a lot more,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Because jazz was invented by African Americans, the documentary
holds a mirror to America's race relations throughout the 20th
century. So Burns hopes that, while the series encourages Americans
to discover or rediscover an art form, it also encourages some
serious reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complicated dynamic,'' he said, ``and one of the
things we are most proud of in this series is that it has not
chosen to accept the simplest, most superficial aspects of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Novick, Burns' co-producer, added: ``I think there will be,
in a way, a kind of redemption in allowing Americans to have a
dialogue about such an important subject that we so often don't
want to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the power of music.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were none.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Wiest will join the 11th season of ``Law &AMP; Order'' this
fall as the new district attorney, replacing Steven Hill, the last
remaining member of the show's original cast.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, producer Dick Wolf said: ``Having a female
actor of this caliber is unprecedented on series television. Dianne
has ... established herself as one of the finest actors of her
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiest, 52, has received two best supporting actress Oscars, for
``Bullets Over Broadway'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' an Emmy
as guest actress in ``Road to Avonlea'' and numerous other awards.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, 78, has played the crusty Adam Schiff since the first
season of ``Law &AMP; Order'' in 1990. His character reportedly will
depart after losing a bid for re-election as district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Hill's gemlike performances ``will be forever etched
in the minds of television viewers.'' A Seattle native, Hill was
the original Mr. Briggs on the first season of ``Mission:
Impossible'' in 1966.

AFTER COURT'S RULING, RAILROAD MERGER WILL PROBABLY NOT HAPPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. and Canadian railroads that were planning to combine
resources to create a rail system spanning North America lost a
court appeal Friday and will probably end up scuttling their
proposed $6 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Washington upheld a temporary ban on railroad
consolidations that was imposed in March by the Surface
Transportation Board of the United States. The board had frozen
action on all mergers after the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.
and the Canadian National Railway Co. announced plans to put
together a vast freight network that would crisscross the United
States and Canada and offer service into Mexico, too. Their merger
would have been the largest in railroad history.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads argued that the board lacked the authority to
impose such a ban and could only approve or reject merger
applications. But the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in a 2-1 decision released Friday morning, ruled that the
board had not exceeded its statutory authority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively upheld the ban that began on March 17 _
the day the board originally imposed the moratorium _ and runs
until June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement released Friday, the two railroads
expressed disappointment over the court's decision but did not
signal their next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither BNSF nor CN will speculate about its options,'' the
statement said. ``The managements of CN and BNSF will discuss the
ruling's implications for their proposed business combination, and
each will consult its respective board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies already have quarterly board meetings scheduled
for this month. The BNSF board is to meet on July 20, and the CN
board on July 24. Spokesmen for both railroads refused to discuss
whether the future of the proposed merger or any further legal
action, including a request for a rehearing or a filing with the
Supreme Court, would be discussed at those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are almost certain that the deal will be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said James M.
Higgins, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. He said that
the Burlington Northern board in particular was impatient and
unwilling to be held up for more than a year, during which anything
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments shortly after the ban was imposed and the
railroads had filed their appeal, Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of
Burlington Northern, expressed doubts that the deal would go
forward if the moratorium was not overturned. In answer to a
question at a luncheon in Washington on March 24, Krebs said that
the economic climate in the industry would change so much during
the postponement that the proposed merger would probably no longer
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   At that same luncheon, Krebs also expressed concerns about the
Surface Transportation Board's announced plans to consider new
rules and regulations governing mergers that would be different
from those under which the venture had been planned by the two
railroads. And he said that the uncertainty generated by such a
long delay would hurt investors and further depress the rail lines'
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The board itself acknowledged that financial markets would react
negatively to a moratorium, but it found that danger would be
outweighed by the potential consequences of moving forward
``without appropriate rules in place at the beginning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the plans were disclosed in December, railroad stock
prices have gyrated wildly in reaction to predictions about what
federal regulators in Washington would do. Overall, Burlington
Northern shares have fallen more than 5 percent this year, while
Canadian National declined a bit over 1 percent. Both were up
slightly Friday as investors responded positively to the court's
action because they believed that some of the uncertainty that has
dogged the rail lines since the merger was proposed had been
lifted. Shares of Burlington Northern rose 68.75 cents, to
$26.9375, while Canadian National also jumped 68.75, to $30.75.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the plans of the two large carriers to
create a coast-to-coast, cross-border rail network have been both
praised and condemned. The new system would include 50,000 miles of
track and combined annual revenue of $12.5 billion. Analysts liked
the fact that despite their huge dimensions, the two systems
overlapped in few places. Railroad executives promised that few
jobs or miles of parallel track would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the vision of a transcontinental railroad came just as
shippers and manufacturers that use the rails were adjusting to a
previous round of mergers that had greatly disrupted service and
left a large number of rail clients unhappy. Many feared that the
Burlington-Canadian National combination would bring on even more
mergers and leave North America with just two very large national
railroads, which would decrease competition and lower the
responsiveness of the railroads to client needs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in Washington believe that more consolidation
is likely in the rail industry. They say they imposed the
moratorium to review regulations and make sure the industry
develops in an orderly way.

PUTIN BRINGS PRO-MILITARY MESSAGE TO ARMS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIZHNY TAGIL, Russia _ When the going gets tough, Vladimir Putin
gets martial.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's president is already renowned for flying a fighter jet
to visit troops fighting rebels in Chechnya and performing judo on
national television to boost his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise Friday that Putin, struggling through
a welter of political crises that have clouded his young
presidency, was out at a firing range, letting off some steam by
unleashing a round from a 122mm howitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Ural Arms 2000, an exhibit of Russian military
hardware that Moscow hopes will help stimulate growth in the
country's massive arms industry and boost the economy. But the
event was also a chance for Putin to repeat one of his favorite
messages: All is well in the land when all is well with the
military.
</P>
<P>
   After firing the howitzer (and receiving the used casing as a
souvenir) Putin watched a series of displays of modern Russian
armor and missiles. The big hit was a T-90s main battle tank _
known here as ``the flying tank'' _ negotiate an obstacle course
like a rally car. At speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, the tank
climbed over walls, swam through a river, and popped a wheely off a
jump, landing with a thud a few yards away and firing its cannon.
Bullseye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all I liked everything,'' a beaming Putin enthused
after congratulating the tank crew and revealing that he has long
been a 122mm howitzer buff. ``They shoot accurately, they move
quickly, they make tanks jump like bicycles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian military hardware is the best in the world,'' crowed a
Russian television commentator, adding that none of the tanks had
been specially prepared for the show. ``Today, every shot was a
bullseye.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, in real life the targets are tougher to hit, and misses
common. Putin, waging battles to rein in oligarchic business
leaders and curb the powers of Russia's regional governors,
received an unpleasant reminder of that Friday from a conflict in
which his generals have often declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   With a defiant interview on Russian television, rebel commander
Shamil Basayev unscored that after months of fighting in Chechnya,
the Russian military has been unable to crush several thousand
separatist guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, an embarassingly public spat between Russia's two
top military commanders over the fate of Russia's nuclear forces
came to a head. Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev called `'psychotic''
a plan pushed by the chief of the general staff, General Anatoly
Kvashnin, to strip down Russia's strategic arsenal. Sergeyev,
travelling with the president, threatened to quit if the scheme was
implemented, but he backed off after Putin intervened, saying it
was merely a discussion of options.
</P>
<P>
   The war in rebellious Chechnya has revealed the poor state of
Russia's conventional military, and a recent army-funded study made
the same finding. While an estimated $4 billion worth of weapons on
display Friday will be sold abroad to virtually anyone who can pay
the price, the Russian Defense Ministry rarely has the money to
order the latest technology for its own troops, said Alexander
Kobin, deputy head of the state arms sales agency.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Eduard Rossel, one of the outspoken opponents of
Putin's plan to limit regional leaders' powers, said this week that
arms manufacturers could sell more if the Kremlin let them deal
with buyers directly, like American defense factories do, rather
than through a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's defense industry has little experience in
marketing, sales, and financing. In the Soviet era, that was all
taken care of by the state, which neglected consumer goods but
lavished funding on developing weapons, including building up a
huge defense industry in this region. Some local arms makers
clearly long for those days, but it is not about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   When the director of one of Nizhny Tagil's largest factories,
which produces armor for tanks, suggested that the government put
more money in the metal industry and less into ``the production of
Tampax,'' Putin brushed the remark off with a smile and a
wisecrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you produce cannot replace those products you are
referring to,'' Putin said. ``And the people need them daily.''
</P>
<P>
   People need a lot of things in Nizhny Tagil _ an upgrade of the
roads last repaired by German prisoners after World War II might be
nice, as would regular running water.
</P>
<P>
   But the news was not all bad at the exhibition. Russian and
foreign dignitaries got their first look at the Iskander-E tactical
rocket launcher, said by Russian analysts to have the highest
accuracy and longest range in its class.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Gushchin, the director of KBM, the firm that makes
Iskander-E, said he expects to increase exports from $20 million to
$100 million this year. The company also makes Arena, a tank
protection system that uses radar to identify and knock out
incoming anti-tank projectiles (like the tank-killing hand-held
grenade launchers Chechen rebels prefer, which KBM also makes).
</P>
<P>
   Turkey recently required that companies wishing to sell it tanks
install Arena. That prompted General Dynamics, maker of the US M-1
Abrams main battle tank, to rush to Moscow for talks with KBM.
</P>
<P>
   The T-90 tanks also seem popular _ India recently placed a
multimillion-dollar order for a shipment _ and people were
expecting Putin to don fatigues and take a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the president turned down the invitation. War games are well
and good, but he has a country to run.

ARMSTRONG REPEATS HIS PROWESS IN TOUR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DRAGUIGNAN, France _ The Tour de France is just more than half
over, and already the scene at the end of each stage has become
repetitious.
</P>
<P>
   The pack of cyclists rides into town, Lance Armstrong hops up
onto the podium to put a fresh yellow jersey over the one he's
already wearing, and gets a bouquet of flowers, a small stuffed
lion, and kisses on the cheeks from two women as he is again
declared overall leader of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scene again after the 13th stage Friday, as no
other rider could put a dent in Armstrong's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Six French riders finished in the top 10. It no doubt would have
been all the more reason to celebrate Bastille Day if a countryman
had taken home the stage's top prize. But Spaniard Jose Vicente
Garcia-Acosta ruined the party when he broke away from the pack
with fewer than 30 miles to go. Frenchmen Nicolas Jalabert and
Pascal Herve joined him, but Garcia-Acosta shook off their
challenges. He crossed the finish line in 4 hours 3 minutes 2
seconds, which was 25 seconds ahead of Jalabert and 10 minutes
ahead of the main pack.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia-Acosta is in 29th place overall, so his win had
little effect on Armstrong, who finished 27th but has a 4:55 lead
over German Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that it was a very pretty course, but we didn't have
much time to look,'' Garcia-Acosta said after his win.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't mind crashing the French holiday. ``Well, it's the
end of the festival in Pamplona, so it's season for celebration
there, too,'' said the 27-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The roads on the 115-mile course weren't nearly as mountainous
as the roads from the day before or the ones will be Saturday _ a
155-mile climb from Draguignan to Briancon _ but Armstrong said he
was surprised at the twisting and turning the cyclists had to
navigate as they made their way from Avignon to Draguignan in the
south of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty surprised at the hardnesss of the course,''
Armstrong said through spokesman Luc Vershueren. ``There were a lot
of very small roads, and I thought I'd get more of a rest between
the two mountain stages.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's small roads or giant mountains, Armstrong has
shown he doesn't discrimiate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, who was riding next to his US Postal Service
teammate almost the entire mountainous stage Thursday, likened it
to being a rabbit in a track race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to set a hard pace to wear the other riders out,
and I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said that by riding just in front of Armstrong's wheel
and allowing him to draft, Armstrong expends about 25 percent less
energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you get him to the most (finishes) as fresh as possible,
then you've done your job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished second in the 12th stage, behind Marco
Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though all signs point to Armstrong wearing the yellow
jersey into Paris next Sunday, US Postal Service team director Mark
Gorski warns against getting too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be focused and feel like you're not way
ahead, because when you start getting complacent, flat tires,
crashes, things can happen. That's part of cycling, and you can't
discount those things too much.''

LEWIS MAY NEED WALKING SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The man who once took step-aside money rather than
force a court-ordered fight with Mike Tyson now wants his employer,
HBO, to do the stepping aside at a huge financial cost so he can
finally have that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, Lennox Lewis wants Tyson to force his employer,
Showtime, to do the same for the third time for Lewis's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Failing either of those things, Lewis told the London Daily Mail
Friday, he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Well, order the cake.
</P>
<P>
   HBO and Showtime are no more going to allow their heavyweights
to meet so the other can reap an expected $100 million pay-per-view
windfall than Bill Parcells is going to come back to New England to
save the Patriots from Bobby Grier.
</P>
<P>
   As Showtime executive Jay Larkin recently put it, ``Pork chops
will grow on the trees in Tel Aviv before we let Tyson go across
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that is they don't believe he'll come back in one
piece. And so there will be no Lennox Lewis-Tyson fight this year.
Or next year. Or any year.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fight because Tyson owes Showtime millions.
Until it gets all of it back, he's going nowhere but on their
channel against safe opponents. HBO is not going to give away the
biggest heavyweight title fight since Evander Holyfield-Tyson I
because it doesn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's threat to retire after his scheduled November title
fight against No. 1 challenger David Tua (if his next bout isn't
against Tyson) is an idle one for the simplest of reasons: He gets
paid more than he's worth to the cable network every time he fights
as it is already. He is not the engine pulling HBO's TV train. That
is Oscar De La Hoya, Naseem Hamed, Felix Trinidad, Shane Mosley,
and Fernando Vargas. On that train, the heavyweight champion is the
financial (and ratings) caboose.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night against Frans Botha, for example, Lewis (36-1)
returns to his hometown of London to fight for the first time in
six years. He will be 35 in September and has said he will not
fight here again. Combined with the fact he is the first British
undisputed heavyweight champion in more than 100 years, he should
be a draw of some magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   But not only has Lewis been unable to fill a 12,000-seat arena
(scaled back from 18,000), he wasn't able to attract much of a
crowd to a free outdoor weigh-in Thursday in Covent Gardens on what
passes for a summer day in this refrigerator of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, when Tyson first appeared in London, madness
ensued everywhere he went. Well past his prime and by now a pariah
in his own country, Tyson drove Englishmen mad. They followed him
everywhere, stormed his hotel, and generally made a nuisance of
themselves whenever he appeared in public. Then they bought more
than 21,000 tickets to his fiasco against Julius Francis in one day
knowing what was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, on the other hand, stands half naked on a weight scale
for free in one of London's biggest parks and fewer than 1,000
people show up. Worse, more than half were heard to say as they
passed, ``Why are those two men standing up there on the piazza in
their knickers?''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly the fight with Botha (42-2-1) is far from compelling
considering that he has been knocked stiff in the only two
significant fights of his life _ a fifth-round KO by Tyson and a
12th-round stoppage against then-champion Michael Moorer. Still,
Lewis's appearance at home needed to inspire a lot more interest
for his retirement threat to hold any weight with HBO.
</P>
<P>
   As for Showtime, what does it care? It would much rather feed
Tyson batting-practice opponents like Francis and Lou Savarese and
watch him act like a maniac to attract attention and viewers than
put him at risk. One more drubbing like the two Holyfield put on
him and the one Buster Douglas gave him and there'll be no more
selling the Godzilla of Brooklyn for $49.95. He'll be like clothes
on the streets of Brooklyn: discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis can rightfully say, ``Tyson is the last big fight of my
era. But if they're going to prevent us from getting it on, there's
no point me carrying on.'' But he also knows he's making more than
$5 million for this bout and probably $7 million for a showdown
with Tua. It is easy money he can continue to pick up until he
retires in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield defeats John Ruiz Aug. 12 to claim the WBA title,
he could probably get $10 million or more for a third fight _
boring as it would be _ because it would again be to unify the
belts and all that nonsense. What's far more likely is that it will
be the Holyfield-Ruiz winner who fights Tyson for the $20
million-$30 million Lewis figures to get for such a match.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Not because the public doesn't want to see a Lewis-Tyson
fight, but because the networks don't need it. Holyfield-Lewis
served a purpose for both networks, even though Showtime had to let
the fights go to HBO. Showtime executives believed Holyfield had a
strong chance of winning. If he did, he would return to Showtime to
continue his contract as the undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
   Since it also already had Tyson, one can only imagine what a
third fight would have done for business in this day of sicko TV
shows. The same holds true today.
</P>
<P>
   HBO was betting Lewis would win and enhance his reputation, but
also knowing it could get out of a contract that has not served it
particularly well because of Lewis's lack of popularity if he lost.
</P>
<P>
   This time the stakes are different. Showtime has nothing to gain
and a big investment to lose if Tyson fights Lewis on HBO and is
destroyed, especially when there's a good chance it can get him a
last title shot with the Holyfield-Ruiz winner and hype it for a
pay-per-view date worth considerable to them.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, who handles Tyson as best one can, knows this as
well. That is why he and Tyson keep saying he's not ready for Lewis
even though Finkel knows Mike Tyson, at 34, is a shadow of what he
once was and fading daily, both mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   So if Lewis truly believes it when he said, ``I'm close to the
point where it's Tyson or nothing. I'm ready to walk away,'' let me
give him a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a comfortable pair of walking shoes first.

   CYRUS-MEHRI-PROFILE (Undated) _ For Cyrus Mehri, challenging the
status quo is second nature. His Iranian mother was punished as a
university student for criticizing the shah. He cut his political
teeth with Ralph Nader, organizing communities to rise up around
issues like telephone rates, and even his birthday, July 14,

So when he filed a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Co.,

   FOOTNOTES-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Where Have All the Footnotes
Gone?'' the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay. At
that point, footnotes lucky enough to survive at all had moved to
the backs of books and turned into less scrutinized end notes. Now,
the Web has not only revived the footnote, it has spawned a

   GERGIEV-BALLET (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Every year, around the

shabby hotels fill up with tourists and at the venerable Maryinsky
(formerly Kirov) Theater, the seats at the ``Stars of the White
Nights'' festival are taken up by rich patrons from all over the

   BOLSHOI-BALLET (New York) _ Power and passion: The Bolshoi
Ballet's dancing has been synonymous with these qualities, making
it a company unlike any other. Virtually sold out for its
appearances at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 this week, as was its
recent five-city U.S. tour, the fabled company from Moscow returns
to New York for the first time in 10 years, and with its potent
mystique intact. By Anna Kisselgoff. (With photo)

<P>
   COMMIE-COMEDY-FILM (Undated) _ The phrase ``Communist musical
comedy'' may sound like an oxymoron, but even the officially
achieved utopia of no-longer-extant East Germany required a few
measures of utopian song-and-dance. ``Hot Summer,'' the teen-age
musical that was the DDR's second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is
not quite socialism a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact
nonetheless. By J. Hoberman.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUBERT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Christopher Gibbs begins his brief
new book on Schubert (``The Life of Schubert,'' Cambridge
University Press) by avoiding any claim to the ``true'' man and
composer. He will, in his words, ``recount what can be reliably
documented and examine some of the persistent images.'' By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ Now for the bad news: Good
news is on vacation. Permanently. In the news media, anyway. That
goes double for news photography: The news photographs you remember
are likely to compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder
of Lee Harvey Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the
streets of Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body
through the streets of Somalia. A show called ``The Pulitzer Prize
Photographs: Capture the Moment,'' at the Newseum/NY through Sept.

   PARIS-FASHIONS (Paris) _ Only 1,000, maybe 1,500 women are rich

entertainment value extending far beyond the thin women who sit
shank to shank along the gold-toned front row. By Cathy Horyn.

<P>
   RUSSIA-RAVE (St. Petersburg) _ On the first weekend of July, as
many as 10,000 Russian youth laid siege to an abandoned and
crumbling Czarist structure some 30 miles off the coast of St.

during the season of northern Russia's White Nights, when the sun

Republican-backed legislation to repeal the federal estate tax over
the next decade, an act that could give both parties rallying
issues at their national conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the GOP-led Senate's final passage of the
proposed repeal, Clinton issued a blistering denunciation of what
he called a ``budget-busting bill that provides a huge tax cut for
the most-well-off Americans at the expense of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators defended the legislation now headed to the
president's desk, calling the estate tax inherently unfair because
it allows the federal government essentially to tax people after
they die. The GOP-dominated House passed the measure last month,
279-136, with 65 Democrats breaking party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax affects about 2 percent of U.S. taxpayers. Almost
half of the revenue is paid from a small number of estates worth $5
million and up. Only a tiny fraction of farms and small businesses
pay the tax because of exemptions _ $675,000 this year for
individuals and $1.3 million for farms and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential
nominee, also weighed in against the tax and challenged his likely
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, to tell Clinton to
sign the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Gore campaign ridiculed the governor's support
for the GOP measure as ``another example of Bush deciding to stand
up only when it benefits the few and well-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's 59-39 vote in favor of the bill fell short of the
67 affirmative votes that would be needed to override a
presidential veto. Nine Democrats broke party ranks in voting for
the repeal, while four Republicans split from the GOP in opposing
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   With the party's nominating conventions looming, the partisan
fighting over taxes will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday is expected to pass legislation, already
approved by the House, that would repeal tax code provisions that
cause dual-income married couples to pay higher income taxes than
they would if they were single. Clinton has said he would veto that
Republican-backed measure as well because it is not tied to his
proposal to provide $250 billion in federal prescription drug
coverage for seniors during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the two GOP-backed measures to the Democratic president
before the Republican convention could make the proposed tax breaks
major issues at the July 31-Aug. 3 event in Philadelphia. At the
meeting, Republicans are expected to formally nominate Bush to be
their party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, will hold their national convention Aug.
14-17 in Los Angeles, where they are expected to pick Gore as their
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pending conventions, Democratic and Republican
senators stayed clear of directly invoking the presidential
showdown into their often heated debate on the proposed estate-tax
repeal. However, the coming November election was clearly on the
minds of several lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Democrats) want to write a law rather than create a
political issue,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, countered that the GOP's objection to
the estate tax was based on principle, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think death ought to be a taxable event,'' Gramm
said. ``We believe that when you build up a family farm or a family
business it ought to be yours for keeps'' and not subject to tax
after death, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's Texas colleague, Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, also
voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debate on the estate tax repeal also provided a
potential preview of the party conventions. Democrats accused the
GOP of being consumed with protecting the wealthy, and Republicans
countered that Democrats are too fond of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we doing moving forward on repealing the tax . . .
instead of using some of this money to make sure that families in
our country can afford good child care for their children,'' said
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``Why aren't we talking about a
commitment to education?''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Wellstone, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., said the tax
applies largely to the few Americans with estates worth $5 million
or more but generates revenue needed to help pay for education and
other programs that help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority's priorities are not those of working-class
people,'' Feingold said of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were just as vitriolic in attacking the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to control people even after they're dead,'' said
Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., adding that the estate tax is
``anti-American, anti-family, unfair, unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Grams, rebutting the accusation that Republicans seek to help
the wealthy, said the estate tax also applies to middle-class
farmers and small-business owners with equipment and other assets
worth $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death taxes hurt hard-working Americans the most,'' he said.
``We're not talking about tax relief for the wealthy. They're going
to take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., assailed the ``insatiable appetite
in Washington, D.C., to get hold of everybody's assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would get rid of the federal estate tax, which
includes gift and generation-skipping transfer taxes, by 2010 and
use $105 billion from the projected budget surplus to make up the
difference. Generation-skipping taxes are those paid when
grandchildren inherit from their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Before passing the GOP-backed legislation, the Senate rejected
53-46 a Democratic substitute that would have raised the exemptions
without repealing the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also rebuffed on a 59-40 vote a proposal by Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., to suspend for 150 days the
18.3-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax in an effort to bring
down the high price at the pump. Opponents said the tax suspension
would reduce revenue needed for highway improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the estate tax accounted for $20 billion of the $1.6
trillion in revenue paid to the federal government, according to
The Center for the Study of Taxation, which opposes the tax.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Santorum Trounces Klink In the Money War &QL;   &UR; By Laura J.
Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (July 14) - Not
much has changed from the general primary season. Democratic Rep.
Ron Klink's war chest looks like a piggy bank compared to his
Republican rival Sen. Rick Santorum's bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   This is deja-vous for Klink. The Democrat from Murrysville
successfully faced down Democrats state Sen. Allyson Schwartz and
former state Labor Secretary Tom Foley in the April primary. While
Klink earned the right face off with Santorum, Klink's fundraising
booty came in a distant third behind the other two top Democratic
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance reports submitted to the Federal Election
Commission cover the second quarter period - March 31 through June
30. The Santorum 2000 campaign reported it raised $1.44 million
retaining $4.34 million in the bank. During the same period
$779,500 trickled into the Klink for U.S. Senate campaign coffers,
leaving it with $564,500 in cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The question is will Klink, a fourth-term House-member, pull off
a repeat performance unseating Santorum and ascending to the Senate
in the November General Election. Six years ago Santorum was a
rookie, squeezing into his seat with 49 percent of the vote. Klink
was reelected to his house seat in 1998, garnering 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Klink's election track record, his campaign manager Mary
Murphy Kiernan would rather look at Klink funding situation as
pockets half full - not half empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on track to have the money we will need to
communicate our message to the voters of Pennsylvania,'' Kiernan
said in a statement. ``Neither poll nor fundraising numbers in July
offer any historical guidance to the outcome of this election. We
will win this race in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Klink more than trebbled his cash on hand in the past three
months from the $119,162 he had at the start of this quarter's
reporting period. Klink's campaign received a total of $1.15
million in contribution since January 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still the incumbent's campaign spokesman Rob Traynham enjoys
having the larger of the two war chests, calling it a sign Santorum
will keep his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers reflect the broad base of support that Sen.
Santorum has developed within every county in Pennsylvania,''
Traynham said in a statement. ``They (Pennsylvanians) are willing
to voice their confidence in him by submitting a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum's campaign did not reveal how much he had raised since
the beginning of the year. His campaign's press release did say
9,766 separate contributions were received in the three-month
period. At the same time the candidate spent $817,000.
</P>
<P>
   Klink's campaign received 1,009 separate contributions in the
second period. He spent just over a third of that spent by his
opponent - $339,626.

ELECTRON BEAMS FROM THE SUN TO GENERATE WEEKEND AURORAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weather in space will be stormy this weekend. That could be
bad news if you run a satellite or an electric power grid, but it's
good news for anyone interested in seeing one of the most
spectacular events that can ever grace the skies: a really
energetic display of aurora, or northern lights.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually powerful blast of particles ejected from the sun
over the last two days was heading straight for Earth, leading
forecasters to predict a strong likelihood of bright auroral
displays Saturday night. The sun is currently right in the middle
of the period of maximum activity in its 11-year cycle, a period
when such outbursts are relatively common.
</P>
<P>
   But the blast this week, a combination of an intense solar flare
and a phenomenon called a coronal mass ejection, or CME, is one of
the strongest recorded so far during this ``solar max'' period. The
resulting solar magnetic storm is the most powerful seen since the
last solar maximum in 1989, according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The storm could cause ``strong'' to ``severe'' magnetic storm
conditions above the Earth and could present problems for
satellites and electric power transmission lines, as well as radio
communications and electronic navigation systems, according to
warnings issued by NOAA.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers warn that even though this weekend's onslaught
of particles from the sun is intense, any auroras that develop will
be masked by the bright moon, which will be full Sunday. Ordinary
northern lights might be completely washed out by the moon's light,
but an unusually bright display could shine through the moonlight.
And only those away from cities and their sky glow will have any
real chance of seeing the display
</P>
<P>
   In northern locations such as Alaska and northern Canada,
auroras are visible almost every night during the solar maximum.
Only the most intense displays extend southward into the
continental United States. This weekend, though, NOAA is predicting
auroral displays that could be visible over ``much of the US.''
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1989, one unusually bright display was seen as far
south as Florida and Arizona, which is extremely rare. At that
time, fire departments in Florida were swamped with calls from
people who thought the reddish glow on the horizon, something they
had never seen before, must have been caused by brush fires.

 &HT;    Bush adviser refutes 'glass ceiling' concept
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A top policy adviser to Gov. George W. Bush
resists the concept of a ``glass ceiling'' that limits women's
career advancement, and equates day care to leaving children ``in
the care of rented strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Willett, who recently went to London to share Bush's ideas
with British conservative leaders, also said in an internal 1998
memo that efforts to improve working conditions for women are
nothing more than ``more government.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, spokeswoman for the Governor's Office, sought to
distance Bush from the memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one person privately expressing his personal opinion
to a colleague,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Willett formerly served as Bush's director of
research and special projects in the Governor's Office. Willett is
now a domestic policy and special projects adviser for the Bush
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He offered his thoughts about working women's issues in a memo
aimed at torpedoing a gubernatorial proclamation honoring the Texas
Federation of Business and Professional Women. The proclamation
declaring ``Business Women's Week'' in Texas, was issued, but only
after it was rewritten to reflect Willett's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A request for a draft of the proclamation was sent to the
governor's general counsel for review.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed similar proclamations for the group in 1997 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the wording of the 1998 proclamation were first
raised by Vance McMahan, Bush's director of policy. Willett
responded to McMahan with a memo saying ``I share the discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I resist the proclamation's talk of `glass ceilings,' pay
equity (an allegation that some studies debunk), the need to place
kids in the care of rented strangers, sexual
discrimination/harassment and the need generally for better
`working conditions' for women (read: more government),'' Willett
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to list his political objections to the Federation of
Business and Professional Women, which has a long history of
backing Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McMahan responded to Willett's concerns by handwriting a none to
Shirley Green, Bush's director of correspondence, that said ``Do we
have to do this proc?''
</P>
<P>
   The final version of the proclamation included a statement that
said, ``Many working women still face resistance in attaining
certain managerial positions, and some still earn less than what
men are paid for the same job.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Federal of Business and Professional Women,
in Philadelphia for their national convention, were not available
for comment on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Edwards said the governor ``absolutely
recognizes and greatly appreciates the vital contributions of women
in the work force.'' ``Many of his most key advisers are women, and
he believes women should be afforded unlimited opportunities in the
workplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards added that Bush ``is very supportive of efforts to
expand and enhance opportunities for working parents to place their
children in quality child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Willett is a leading advocate of Bush's effort to use government
money and assistance to help faith-based organizations provide
social services, including drug treatment. Bush campaign spokesman
Scott McClellan said Willett was unavailable for comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Willett accompanied Bush adviser Marvin Olasky to
London for a meeting with William Hague, leader of the British
conservative party. The trip was paid for by a British public
policy foundation.

DIGITAL VIDEO CAN COST MORE THAN FILM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Miguel Arteta first put himself on the map in Hollywood
with ``Star Maps,'' a stylish little film about a Latino teen who
hawks guides to celebrity homes. Now he's back with the smartly
creepy ``Chuck &AMP; Buck,'' and this time, he ditched the richly toned
film of ``Star Maps'' for digital video.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't do it to save money, the reason many independent
and documentary filmmakers go digital these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually shot `Star Maps' for less money,'' Arteta said.
``In 'Star Maps,' we literally used the short ends of (unused) film
from people. We begged, borrowed and stealed to make that film.''
</P>
<P>
   Arteta's choice of digital video (he used the stalwart Sony DCR
VX-1000 camera) ``was definitely an artistic decision. I saw
(Thomas Vinterberg's 1998 DV film) 'The Celebration' and hadn't
seen where the technology was until then. The new (digital video)
transfers to film have this new finish to them, a silkiness, that
feels very intimate and immediate. I thought, 'This is fantastic.'
''
</P>
<P>
   That immediacy fed directly into the overall feel of ``Chuck &AMP;
Buck,'' which plays with our notions of, and screenwriting
conventions about, obsessive relationships. Because the video feels
more ``real,'' more like life than a Hollywood fantasy, it feeds
into our growing dread as the movie progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Using DV also contributed to the film's acting performances,
Arteta said, because he could use smaller crews, longer shoot times
and two cameras at once. That said, technology isn't the only thing
that makes a film work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like technology is very important to
filmmaking, but it gets too much of an emphasis,'' Arteta said.
``What I go to a theater for is to get to an emotional place. It's
all about how fresh the characters are, how fresh the performances
are. Ultimately, does the audience care that 'Clerks' was shot in
16mm (film), '(The) Blair Witch (Project)' in DV or 'Taxi Driver'
in Super 35mm (film)? If you can access the emotional space, it
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ---Devil of a good time &QL; 
The wait is finally over for fans of Diablo, the beautifully
wrought role- playing adventure from Irvine-based Blizzard
Entertainment that was such a hit several years ago. The game's
long-awaited sequel, Diablo II, finally hit store shelves about two
weeks ago, but didn't stay on them for long: More than 127,000
copies of the game were sold the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor is understandable. It's a terrific game, at least to
my feeble first efforts to slog through, pushing the original's
great graphics and involving gameplay forward in lots of ways. Put
simply, this game looks great and plays great.
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard has replaced the original five-player types with five
others and has adds lots of little tweaks that make things like
going inside buildings easier and more intuitive. And of course,
there's Battle.net, Blizzard's excellent online gaming service,
where you can play other humans.
</P>
<P>
   My only knocks so far aren't really knocks, even. One is that
getting hooked on this game is devilishly easy. Two is that, once
hooked, it guarantees my right index finger shall be worn to a nub.
That's because you keep the left-click button depressed much of the
time as you intuitively guide your character through the game's
caves, castles and killer moors. I'll be suffering from some sort
of carpal tippal syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   And again, for you digital moviemakers, the game's opening
cinematic sequence is worth noting for its remarkably lifelike
computer-generated ``performers.'' It is in such games that we are
seeing some of the most interesting advances in graphics, advances
that aren't far, if at all, from big-screen quality.
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard also has good news for Macintosh users, who won't have
to wait much longer to get the good stuff. Diablo II for the Mac
has ``gone gold,'' which means it soon should be flying off store
shelves as well. &QL;

  Films of 2000 suffer from a desire to please everybody 
(For use after July 16, 2000, by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we are, just past the midpoint of a new century's first
year, and I've already seen half the makings of my top-10 movie
list.
</P>
<P>
   There's been ``The Decalogue,`` Krzysztof Kieslowksi's towering,
10-part examination of the human condition; ``Rear Window,'' Alfred
Hitchcock's impeccably astute, entertaining and (in this time of
``Big Brother'') ultra-relevant take on that fundamental cinematic
act, voyeurism; Robert Altman's panoramic study of the American
character and its obsession with celebrity, ``Nashville''; Luis
Bunuel's smartly surrealistic dissection of middle-class hypocrisy,
``The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''; and ``Blood Simple,''
Joel and Ethan Coen's kicky, kinetic revitalization of film noir
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I can't actually put any of those titles on a 2000
top-10 list, since they're all a decade or more old. But that
doesn't change the fact that they are, far and away, the most
ambitious and accomplished movies that I've seen all year.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying, is this any way to start a new
century?
</P>
<P>
   While it's an industry tradition to release anything with a
semblance of artistic merit only in the last four months of a given
year, usually by this time, a dozen or so films of outstanding
craftsmanship, formal invention, intelligence or entertainment
value have made their way into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at this juncture in 1999, we'd seen ``The Matrix,''
``Analyze This,'' ``Election,'' ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels,'' ``Run Lola Run,'' ``The Dream Life of Angels,'' ``Lovers
on the Bridge'' and ``My Son the Fanatic.'' Even ``American Pie''
and ``The Blair Witch Project,'' despite any lapses they may have
been guilty of in taste or stylistic agreeability, achieved all of
the deceptively difficult goals that their makers had aimed for.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before we got a gander at ``The Sixth Sense,'' and
all the REALLY good stuff that started coming out in September.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000, on the other hand, has been noteworthy not just
for a higher level of mediocrity than usual, but for far too many
movies with substantial positive qualities that have been
undermined by egregious faults of equal degree.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best releases of 2000, so far, possessed flaws that
nagged away at what might have been purely pleasurable experiences.
``Erin Brockovich'' is marvelously entertaining, but for that very
reason, who could believe a second of this ``true life story''
actually happened in the rousing, crowd-pleasing manner depicted?
The critically acclaimed ``Wonder Boys'' was certainly long on
shaggy charm and by no means short of brains, but its concerns
were, to pun and not to pun, academic to the point of preciousness.
The year's best-reviewed European import, ``Beau Travail,'' is
inarguably beautiful and uncompromising, but loses its way in an
artistic severity that grows as arid as its striking desert
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the general run of popular movies this year: People hate
'em! Not all people, obviously, but 2000 has been marked by a
phenomenon unlike any I've seen in more than a decade at this job:
The response, by both critics and casual moviegoers, to just about
everything has been extremely polarized.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone who thought ``Mission: Impossible 2'' was a
great-looking, kinetic thrill ride, you can find somebody who
considered it a noisy, incoherent mess. ``Gladiator'' was either a
pointless orgy of gratuitous bloodshed or a meaningful critique of
gratuitous bloodshed, depending not on any intrinsic philosophical
virtues but on how it struck you. ``Dinosaur's'' computer graphics
were breathtakingly lifelike and its story was deadeningly rote.
``The Perfect Storm's'' storm was the white-knuckle experience of
the summer, but the film's terrifyingly inept character work was
almost as frightening. ``Scary Movie'' is just plain hilarious,
except to the many viewers who didn't laugh once ...
</P>
<P>
   And on and on it goes. Except for the movies that everyone who
isn't a TV film reviewer agrees were dreadful (and they are legion:
``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ``Battlefield Earth,'' ``Titan A.E.,''
``Rocky and Bullwinkle'') and the one picture, ``Chicken Run,''
that impresses most who see it (though clay chickens can only
achieve so much greatness), any movie you attend this year is more
likely than not to trigger a fight with your date.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing new about this. People have
disagreed about movies since, if not time immemorial, at least the
start of the last century. But rarely have the disagreements been
so extreme and plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many films been so frustratingly compromised? The
usual suspects of overreaching talent, overarching egos and
starting movies with unfinished scripts all clearly contribute to
the situation. But I'd guess the main culprit is, ironically, the
pronounced desire of filmmakers and those who pay them to appeal to
as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Every time out. No matter how seriously that
lowest-common-denominator approach betrays what any particular film
is really about.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the sea saga ``U-571'' starts out as a conceptual,
war-of-nerves thriller based on complicated deceptions but, since
that might tax the perceived mentality of action fans, halfway
through it morphs into a series of unbelievable submarine stunts.
Similarly, ``Shaft,'' ``The Patriot'' and ``X-Men,'' all movies
with ambitions beyond hitting simple action beats, play like
they're nervous about doing anything that would distract too much
from those beats. They touch on serious issues but don't dig into
them, wary that that might spoil the fun _ in movies whose
derivative stunt and effects sequences don't generate a whole lot
of fun anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation has been taking place on a smaller scale in
the independent and foreign sectors. A handful of titles (``The
Virgin Suicides,'' ``Croupier,'' ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'') have exhibited
truly unique visions that were neither dependent on anachronistic
Shakespeare (the updated ``Hamlet'' and ``Love's Labours Lost''),
focused on trends that are already tired (``American Psycho,'' all
of those rave movies) or guilty of the same emotional and political
simplifications Hollywood trades in, only ``smarter''
(``Kikujiro,'' ``Sunshine,'' ``Shower'').
</P>
<P>
   In the bigger picture, as with those pseudo-thoughtful small
films, smartness isn't necessarily the answer. If it were, the lazy
tasteless gag-filled ``Scary Movie'' would not be a bigger success
than the imaginative tasteless gag-filled ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene.''
If, as so many hopeless critics hope, the public just wants smarter
movies, then ``Big Momma's House'' would not be the surprise hit of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   What may be the answer is to make films that aren't afraid to be
completely what they are rather than consumer-researched
compendiums of clashing elements for different demographics. Sure,
some folks might be alienated by, say, a Revolutionary War movie
that thoroughly examines the costs and complexities of our
country's birth, or by dinosaurs who act like, well, the animals
that they so convincingly appear to be. But while some may then
choose not to attend (gasp!) a movie they won't like anyway, those
who are attracted will likely enjoy the film more, and recommend it
more enthusiastically to like-minded friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's how ``American Beauty'' became an unexpected blockbuster
last year. And of course, more often than not, a movie that remains
true to the kind of work it was intended to be, not some mutation
that works against itself in careless pursuit of the wrong
audience, is the best way for a film to turn out great. Hitchcock,
Kieslowski, Altman, Bunuel and the Coens all could tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm not real confident that I'll see that attitude being
manifested anytime soon, I still look forward optimistically to the
second half of the landmark year 2000. And why shouldn't I? After
all, the release schedule lists ``The Exorcist,'' ``A Hard Day's
Night,'' ``This Is Spinal Tap'' and Akira Kurosawa's ``Ran.'' They
all sound like they might be pretty good. &QL;

BRATTON MULLING TRY FOR N.Y.C. MAYOR'S OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William J. Bratton, the former top cop here, is
considering a return to public life, this time as the mayor of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seriously looking at it,'' he said in a phone interview
Friday. ``Over the last several months, I've had meetings with a
lot of people to get their opinions on my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Democrat and now a registered independent, Bratton also
confirmed a report _ which first appeared in Friday's New York Post
_ that he might run for the office as a Republican, to avoid what
is bound to be a crowded Democratic primary. The mayoral election
will be held in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody born outside of New York has ever been elected mayor
here. However, Edward I. Koch, the city's most overtly New
Yorker-ish mayor in recent times, does not see that as an obstacle
for Bratton. ``He has a record here,'' Koch said. ``I consider him
a son of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Koch, who was one of the people Bratton sought out for
advice, added that he did not give him much encouragement: ``I told
him that I thought he'd be best-served by accepting _ as I'm sure
he will be offered _ the position of police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was first-rate at that job,'' Koch continued, ``but then he
left public service. The other four likely candidates have never
done anything but public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant, who has not met with
Bratton, agreed: ``He's thinking Giuliani came into this as US
attorney, so he can come into it as former police commissioner. The
difference is, there was a lot of crime back then. There isn't
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sheinkopf added, ``He's got as good a shot as any of the
other four. He'd do well in the outer boroughs and he'd cut into
the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton made a splash when he moved here from Boston in 1990 _
as crime in the subways was nearly wiped out when he was Mayor
David N. Dinkins's transit police chief, and crime in the streets
was slashed when he was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's first-term
police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani pushed him out of the job in 1996 in a clash of egos
over who deserved more credit for the crime reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton briefly thought about running against Giuliani in the
following year's election, but gave up the idea, realizing that his
boss-turned-nemesis _ then at the peak of his popularity _ was
unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different set of equations now,'' Bratton
said.
</P>
<P>
   First, due to term-limit laws, Giuliani cannot run again.
</P>
<P>
   Second, no clear front-runner has emerged among the four
Democrats who plan to run _ and there are no Republicans in the
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bratton thinks he can make headway amid the anxiety over
crime spurts and racial tensions marking the final months of the
Giuliani era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are growing concerns about crime, with Giuliani leaving
and his close association with that issue,'' Bratton said. ``That's
an area where I have a strong reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent spate of police shootings and shakedowns in
black neighborhoods, he added, ``crime, race, and police brutality
are all related now.'' He would make a campaign issue of boosting
Boston-style ``community policing'' _ an idea that Bratton began to
push in his final days as commissioner but which Giuliani rejected.
</P>
<P>
   As for other subjects, Bratton allowed, ``Nobody knows where I
stand on a lot of issues,'' but he sees this as an advantage: ``I
have flexibility. I can use a campaign to help shape an image,
establish positions on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, 52, is currently a consultant on law-enforcement
issues. He travels around the world. He is working on a TV pilot,
based on his own career. ``It's a cross between `West Wing' and
`Law and Order,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he added, ``I'm having a pretty good life right now,
and the money is great.'' But, ``The public sector, making change _
I like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The declared candidates include City Council speaker Peter
Vallone, Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green, and
Bronx borough President Fernando Ferrer.

   PEARL RIVER, La. -- All David Kulivan wanted to do was kill his
first wild turkey.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, 1999, at age 21 and on spring break from Louisiana
State University, he managed to call one from its roost.
</P>
<P>
   But the turkey landed behind him and skittered away before he
could shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a fool out of me,'' Kulivan said.
</P>
<P>
   So early the next morning he returned to the Pearl River
Wildlife Management Area, a bayou-threaded woodlands 45 minutes
northeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in camouflage, cradling a 12-gauge shotgun, he waited
for another chance to show a gobbler who's boss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says, two large, vivid woodpeckers flew into view
and landed on a water oak about 25 yards from him.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes they flew to another oak, only 10 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan was familiar with all the common woodpeckers, including
the big one, the pileated.
</P>
<P>
   But these were the biggest woodpeckers he'd ever seen. They had
more white in the wings than he remembered from pileateds. One had
a red crest, the other a black crest. Each had a creamy white beak.
</P>
<P>
   At LSU, Kulivan had briefly studied the ivory-billed woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   He learned that most ornithologists considered it extinct, but
some believed it might be hiding out in remote forests of Cuba and
the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   When the birds hit the first tree, Kulivan wondered if he might
be seeing ivory-bills.
</P>
<P>
   When they landed on the second, he quit wondering. ``There was
no doubt in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes the woodpeckers flew away.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan strode after them. He heard them do a toy-trumpetlike
call for a while, but never got another look.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan drove to the New Orleans suburb where his parents live.
He felt both privileged and burdened.
</P>
<P>
   He'd had a camera in his bag but had failed to get a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   And he'd seen the birds on April 1 -- April Fool's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting, because I saw something that a lot of other
people think is extinct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other emotion, I guess, was maybe a little trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Like, `What's going to happen when I say it?' I knew I had to
say it.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it was the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   But I wondered, `Are people going to assassinate my
character?'''
</P>
<P>
   The following Monday spring break was over and he was back at
LSU, attending Vernon Wright's course on the natural history of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   After the lecture, he went up to the professor, whose
encyclopedic knowledge of the state's flora and fauna had deeply
impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to you, quickly,'' Kulivan said.
</P>
<P>
   They did talk, and Kulivan told him everything, and the life of
the young man who only meant to kill a wild turkey hasn't been
quite the same since.
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the ivory-billed woodpecker existed throughout
the
</P>
<P>
   mountain forests of Cuba and swamp forests of the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   At 20 inches long, it was -- or is -- the second-largest
woodpecker in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early naturalists remarked on the ivory-bill's majestic beauty
and
</P>
<P>
   frantic energy.
</P>
<P>
   Country people, impressed by its 3-inch beak and ability
</P>
<P>
   to shred long strips of bark, dubbed the bird ``Log Cock'' and
``Lord God.''
</P>
<P>
   Less adaptable than the smaller, similar-looking pileated
woodpecker, the ivory-bill depended on recently dead trees in
mature forest for nesting sites and wood-boring beetle larvae, its
main food.
</P>
<P>
   As the virgin stands fell, the bird's range narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-19th century, ornithologists were remarking on the
ivory-bill's decline.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, some believed it extinct.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1932, a few ivory-bills were found in east Louisiana, in
Tensas River bottomland woods owned by the Singer Sewing Machine
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later ornithologists from Cornell University, in
Ithaca, N.Y., went to the Singer Tract and made a recording of
ivory-bills calling.
</P>
<P>
   From 1937 to 1939, James Tanner, part of the Cornell team, did
an intensive study of six ivory-bills he found in the Singer Tract.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner also visited other swamps in hopes of finding additional
remnant populations.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner found none, but based on reliable reports he estimated
there were 22 ivory-bills in the United States in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protests, logging of the bird's habitat continued,
including at the Singer Tract.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the early 1950s in the United States, and the 1980s in
Cuba, have there been widely accepted ivory-bill sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Most ornithologists have given up hope of seeing one alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to believe, of course, but I'd say two-thirds of
them think it's impossible,'' said Van Remsen, curator of birds at
LSU's Museum of Natural Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the other third would say `highly unlikely.''' Remsen
puts himself in the optimistic ``no opinion'' category.
</P>
<P>
   He does so partly because of his encounter with David Kulivan,
turkey hunter.
</P>
<P>
   X X X Vernon Wright, the LSU wildlife biology professor,
listened to Kulivan's story.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had him type up a description of the sighting, then sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was proceeding like Scotland Yard, but he was inclined to
believe his student.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan had a reputation for both scholarship and good character
within the LSU School of Forestry, Wildlife &AMP; Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the hot-dog type,'' Wright said of Kulivan, a
practicing Catholic and political conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Wright sent Kulivan's statement to Remsen at the Museum of
Natural Science.
</P>
<P>
   Remsen gathered LSU's best bird people -- professors and
graduate students -- and summoned Kulivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grilled him pretty hard,'' Remsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to call it an inquisition, but I deal with a
couple of ivory-billed woodpecker reports every year, and I've
never been interested in any before, because they were obviously
pileated or even red-headed woodpeckers.
</P>
<P>
   But his description was amazingly good.'' Most impressive to
Remsen, Kulivan mentioned details about the bird that weren't in
field guides, such as its call, way of shredding bark, and loud but
echolike ``double tap'' when pounding a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan freely conceded the April 1 date and his failure to get
a to him that Kulivan's account had the weirdness of truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remsen was convinced and stated it was the most credible
sighting reported to LSU in 20 years,'' said Steve Shively, a
zoologist with the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Department.
</P>
<P>
   X X X The state of Louisiana quietly put a moratorium on timber
harvesting at the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area, a
35,000-acre fishing and hunting tract.
</P>
<P>
   And, with Kulivan leading the way, about 15 ornithologists and
birders spent a late April Saturday walking the area.
</P>
<P>
   They hiked to the spot where Kulivan had his sighting, then
played the recording of ivory-bills that the Cornell team had made
in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   No response.
</P>
<P>
   They broke into groups and spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought the habitat was good enough to support
ivory-bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought they heard a double tap.
</P>
<P>
   Others figured that was the sound of tires on a nearby
interstate overpass.
</P>
<P>
   One searcher was Laurence Binford, a well-known, LSU-trained
ornithologist who believes he heard an ivory-bill calling near the
Tensas River in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 40 years later, he was among those who heard a
double tap, a sound he has heard many times in Mexico while
studying the pale-billed woodpecker, which is in the same genus as
the ivory-bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people claimed it was road noise, which I didn't believe,
because I heard that noise hundreds of times during the morning,''
Binford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This didn't sound anything like that.'' But neither he nor
anyone else saw ivory-bills.
</P>
<P>
   There would be more group searches in the next weeks, but the
optimal period had passed, due to foliage (which helps birds hide),
bugs, snakes, heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed to make a push the following winter, and to keep
the sighting quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Kulivan went back to LSU, finished his exams, then drove to
northern Virginia where he would spend the summer working at the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   X X X Serious birdwatchers call themselves ``birders.'' Birders
aren't content to enjoy whatever flies past the breakfast nook.
</P>
<P>
   Birders go looking for birds, and keep a ``Life List'' of
species they've seen.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) When explaining how much they would
like to see an ivory-billed woodpecker, birders don't have to grope
for a metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor is right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people I could die after I see the ivory-bill,''
said Guy Luneau, a chemical engineer and hard-charging birder from
Kilgore, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the holy grail.'' (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) Ivory-bill
fever broke out among birders in late January of this year when The
Clarion-Ledger, the daily newspaper in Jackson, Miss., published
the first story about Kulivan's sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Now back at LSU pursuing a master's degree in wildlife, Kulivan
began to hear from scores of birders and ornithologists who wanted
a blow-by-blow account.
</P>
<P>
   Birders created Web sites for discussion about the ivory-bill's
status.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana Ornithological Society began advertising ``I Want
to Believe'' T-shirts with drawings of a male and female
ivory-bill.
</P>
<P>
   The main development was the arrival in southeast Louisiana of
dozens of birders, from all over the country, determined to find
Kulivan's birds.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Luneau and his brother, David, came from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Scott came from Maryland and Jim Williams from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Russell arrived from New Jersey, taking vacation from his
job as a wildlife biologist for the U.S.

<P>
   Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) Out in Sacramento, Calif., John
Trochet heard about Kulivan's sighting.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, sensing his excitement, gave him a vacation to
Louisiana as a birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a week in the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area,
devoting hours to rigorous searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wonderful time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't see ivory-bills.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) The birders saw promisingly large
woodpecker holes, and trees with shredded bark.
</P>
<P>
   Some people had intriguing glimpses of flying birds, and Mary
Scott is pretty sure she saw an unusually large woodpecker with
lots of white in the wings, though she didn't manage to take a Most
of those who looked are being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard or saw anything during my four days in February
that in any way, shape or form would I say was an ivory-bill,'' Guy
Luneau said.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that he and the other birders had searched only
a fraction of the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to return next January, when deer hunting season has
ended and the leaves have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) When he could, David Kulivan went
with the birders.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed with their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Some wore camouflage, the way a turkey hunter would do.
</P>
<P>
   Others covered themselves with bug spray and lugged into the
woods binoculars, spotting scopes, cameras and boom boxes, on which
to play the Cornell recording of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   One group carried a cell phone to maintain long-distance contact
with an animal communicator, a sort of woodpecker whisperer who
gave advice on search techniques.
</P>
<P>
   This did not impress Kulivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a psychic is going to help us find the birds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) X X X Van Remsen warned Kulivan that
some people would lump him in with those who say they've seen
Bigfoot or Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been quite that bad, but there are skeptics willing to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the deal is but I know what the deal isn't,
and it isn't two live ivory-bills,'' said Wes Biggs, a top Florida
birder who tried and failed to find ivory-bills reported in South
Carolina in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs thinks it's been too long since the last unchallenged
sighting for there to be any real hope.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that birdwatching's popularity has grown in recent
years, along with the desperation of top birders to see new
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a bird of that size, with that loud of a
voice, could be any place in North America where it's not going to
be found,'' Biggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, nothing would please me more than to be proved
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I'd give up every bird on my Life List if I could add the
ivory-bill.'' Bob Russell, one of the searchers for Kulivan's
birds, thinks Biggs will be proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are lots of birders, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't been aggressive enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much wimps compared to the naturalists of the
19th century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to go to the swamp for a month without going home.
</P>
<P>
   We hardly ever get into the parts of the swamp where the birds
might be.'' Russell and other believers also point to the frequent
number of ivory-bill reports through the years, some of them from
knowledgeable sources.
</P>
<P>
   John V.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, author of articles and books about birds, says he saw an
ivory-billed woodpecker in the Big Thicket area of east Texas in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   James Tanner, the Cornell-trained expert, came to check it out,
didn't see the bird, didn't like the habitat, and left dismissing
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, now 80 and living in Princess Anne, Md., remains bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who doesn't have a doctor's degree or graduated from
Cornell or something, they think this guy's just seen a pileated
woodpecker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics counter that none of the recent reports of ivory-bills
-- including Dennis' -- has been documented by photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has any been verified by birders who came along afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody comes up with anything concrete,'' said Paul Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, a biologist and birding legend (he has a longer Life List
than almost any other member of the American Birding Association),
joined Tanner in checking out Dennis' report.
</P>
<P>
   He said they concluded, after thorough investigation, that
Dennis almost certainly got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Sykes has chased other hot ivory-bill
reports, none of which panned out.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he went to the Pearl River Wildlife Management
Area.
</P>
<P>
   He liked the habitat, and he thinks a turkey hunter like Kulivan
would be a good bet to see any surviving ivory-bills.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't see or hear anything that gave him much hope the
birds exist there.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story seems impeccable,'' Sykes said of Kulivan, ``but
I've been through this before.'' There are agnostics in the debate,
and they include Steve Shively, the zoologist with the Louisiana
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent many hours looking for Kulivan's birds, and many
more listening to the back and forth about whether ivory-bills are
still around.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his gut feeling on the matter, Shively thought for a
second, then laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling,'' he said, ``is I don't know.'' X X X Maybe
someday delayed stress syndrome will take hold, and David Kulivan
will awake screaming from nightmares in which ivory-billed
woodpeckers double tap on his head.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he insists he's feeling pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   He appreciates those ornithologists and birders who support him.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't blame the doubters.
</P>
<P>
   He's glad there was rigorous searching this winter and spring,
and looks forward to more next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of finding the bird, I'm pleased with what we've
accomplished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it just seems so difficult to ever find it out there.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of birds, thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   But if we can concentrate on certain kinds of habitat, in
certain areas we think they might be visiting, we can increase our
odds.'' (FOURTH OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) One measure of Kulivan's
poise is that he sometimes returns alone to the Pearl River
Wildlife Management Area.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, 2000, a day short of the anniversary of his
sighting, he saw two wild turkeys there.
</P>
<P>
   He shot one, his first ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud.'' t

MINISTER QUESTIONS BUSH'S COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ In a dramatic demonstration that campaign
events can only be scripted so far, Texas Governor George W. Bush
found his claim to be a compassionate conservative called into
question Friday by a Presbyterian minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had come to the Elizabethport Presbyterian Center in this
low-income, largely African American community to talk about the
benefits of faith-based after-school programs, summer camps and
other good works.
</P>
<P>
   Noting his desire to ``close the gap of hope in America,'' Bush
proposed boosting the amount of money the federal government gives
states to pay for after-school programs. And he said religious
groups should have full access to that money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't count on the Reverend Joseph H. Garlic, who was
sitting nearby, to abruptly change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not live with myself if I did not ask about Gary
Graham,'' said Garlic, referring to the 135th person to be put to
death in Texas during Bush's tenure in office. Graham was convicted
of murdering an Arizona man during a robbery in Houston 19 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talked this morning about love and giving people an
opportunity and I think that the doubt that surrounded the case of
Gary Graham gave you an opportunity to show some compassion and
love in a way that had not been shown before,'' Garlic lectured,
with Bush listening closely.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, a Democrat who said he is undecided in the presidential
race, told the governor that he missed a chance to show just what
he meant when he calls himself a new Republican. And he urged Bush
to rethink his confidence in the criminal justice system's ability
to ensure that no innocents are executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly when it relates to black people, the justice
system has not always been fair in this country, you have to admit
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush allowed that there is room for improvement in the system,
but he firmly defended the Graham execution and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty because I think it saves lives
when it's administered fairly and justly and surely,'' said Bush.
Vice President Gore also favors capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to uphold the laws of my state, that's what I was
sworn in to do, and I upheld the law,'' said Bush. ``In this case
or in other cases it's not an easy decision to make as I'm sure you
can understand. This is not political decision for me, Reverend.
This is a decision of principle. This is a decision of utmost
importance. It's a decision I take seriously. . . . If it costs me
votes, so be it. That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, however, was not appeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an answer. That is not a good enough answer for
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange occurred on a day that Democrats were also trying
to sow doubts about Bush's claim to compassion by trumpeting news
that the Texas Department of Human Services failed to use $33
million in federal funds available to the state to provide meals
for low-income children last year. The unspent funds were detailed
in a report by the Food Research and Action Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost depressing to continue to see the plight of the
poor children get worse in Texas when we really can and should do
something about it,'' said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat
from Dallas. ``He talks about being compassionate. He's
compassionate to conservatives. It's nothing to do with being
compassionate to the needy.''
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and appearances around the country, Bush urges
audiences ``to rally the armies of compassion.'' He says he is a
different kind of Republican. And he has spoken to non-Republican,
black and Latino audiences to prove it. On Monday, he addressed the
national convention of the NAACP, the nation's largest civil rights
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By going there, I hope people will say, `This guy may be a
little different cut from the past,' '' Bush said, noting that not
too many presidential candidates have visited this hardscrabble New
Jersey neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to say the same thing across the country,''
said Bush. ``I have to say what's in my heart -- that I've got deep
care for the youngsters of this country.''

 &HT;    BellSouth-SBC venture to be based in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth and SBC Communications have unveiled the
first details of their planned wireless venture: The chief
executive comes from one partner and the headquarters will be in
the home city of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Carter, who now heads SBC's wireless unit, will be chief
executive of the new company, which will start life this fall as
the nation's second-largest wireless company and will be based in
Atlanta. A specific location for the headquarters has not yet been
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have said since announcing the alliance this
spring that SBC _ as the largest partner _ will own the majority
stake, but the two will share management 50-50. The four-member
board of directors will include two men from each company.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Feidler, who now heads BellSouth's wireless phone unit,
will be chief operating officer of the new company, and Rick
Lindner, now senior vice president and chief operating officer for
SBC Wireless, will be chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Chairman Duane Ackerman has made a public commitment
to put as many employees as possible near mass transit routes
within Atlanta city limits. However, neither Feidler nor Carter
would predict that the new headquarters would meet that criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't speculate on that,'' Carter said. ``Suffice it
to say that we are looking at all the options.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent telecom projects, including Alltel and GTE
Wireless _ now Verizon _ have been sited in Alpharetta, Ga. A
consolidation of WorldCom employees may also be headed there.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has about 2,300 employees working for its wireless
unit, which is headquartered across from BellSouth Corp.
headquarters. It is too early to say how many would move, and how
many jobs would shift from the base of SBC's wireless unit in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   At least one will: Carter, who lives in the Dallas suburb of
Plano, will move to Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Job reductions to save money in combining two units are
possible, but are unlikely to be dramatic, Feidler said. ``Wireless
is such a rapidly growing business the pact is generally going to
be very, very modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for creating a company that will immediately have
more than 17.4 million customers and reach areas in 34 states where
175 million people live. Included in that turf will be 42 of the
nation's top 50 markets. Only Verizon, which combined the wireless
units of GTE, AirTouch and Bell Atlantic, will be bigger. By
comparison, AT&AMP;T and affiliates have 12.9 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But several key markets _ most especially New York City _ will
not be covered by SBC-BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Until those gaps are filled, the new company will lack the reach
of national providers AT&AMP;T, Sprint and Nextel. But the new company
will either bid for licenses or buy smaller companies. Both SBC and
BellSouth have also thus far managed to do well in wireless with
only regional presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really feeling very good about our ability to
compete,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements seemed to offer hefty evidence that neither
BellSouth nor SBC is going to bid for Sprint, whose merger with
WorldCom was officially scotched this week. Some speculation had
BellSouth buying Sprint after selling its wireless unit to SBC.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC-BellSouth venture could conceivably suffer from using
two different technologies. One, called CDMA, is used in most of
the properties. But BellSouth in the Carolinas and SBC in Nevada
and California also use a technology called GSM.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a traveler using a phone made for one technology
cannot ``roam'' onto the other kind of network. But SBC and
BellSouth have been pushing manufacturers to make phones that can
easily move between both, and those phones should be available next
year, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the CDMA technology has been behind GSM in
carrying data transmissions in addition to voice. The newer phones
will let the new companies catch up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports had the companies committed to placing
headquarters in a neutral city and selecting a top executive from
outside both companies. That was apparently a misunderstanding. The
companies hired a search firm to seek executives, and also
considered headquarters elsewhere. But in the end it was home-grown
management and an Atlanta home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough to find a city better than Atlanta or Dallas
to put a company like this,'' Feidler said.

 &HT;    Soldiers meet `baby' they saved in WWII
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOTHAN, Ala. _ Ben Byrd searched for enemy soldiers in the small
stucco house of an Old World German village. He found a crying
baby.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1945, on a cold February afternoon in Baldringen _ 12
miles from Trier, Germany's oldest city, where ruins of the Roman
Empire remain. The end of World War II still was months away.
Byrd's battalion was helping secure the town.
</P>
<P>
   Private first class Byrd and buddies Harry Biggs and Rene
Binette drew their rifles and entered the house in the middle of
town. Near the kitchen, a 7-month-old cried. The baby was
well-wrapped in a blanket, placed with a bottle of milk in a wicker
carriage.
</P>
<P>
   They pushed the buggy outside and headed to the church two
blocks away, where civilians had taken shelter. There was a stir as
they approached. The baby's mother shoved through the crowd. She
cried. She thanked Byrd, Biggs and Binette in German and took the
child.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers never got a name, never knew whether they had saved
a boy or a girl. They returned to the house and spent the night.
The battalion marched away the next morning. Before they left,
enemy artillery shook the house.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, shrapnel from a German shell struck Byrd in the
right shoulder. He recovered in Bristol, England, before returning
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old left the army later that year and registered for
pre-med classes at Auburn University. Byrd became a general
surgeon, working in Louisville and Richmond before settling into
practice near his hometown of Ozark, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, he wondered about the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd thought about him a thousand times,'' said Byrd, 74.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight over barbecue and beer, the soldiers _ and the refound
baby _ will celebrate their reunion 55 years later at a party with
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Using old war notes, a German native in Dothan as translator,
encouragement from his wife and daughter and letters to
Baldringen's burgermeister, Byrd found the baby again: 55-year-old
Josef Koltes, a retired locksmith who still lives in the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three _ my saviors,'' Koltes said in Byrd's living room
with the help of a translator.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Koltes and his wife, Elke, arrived at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport. It's their first visit to the
United States. Byrd, his wife, Sue, and German native Ilse Cantey
waited at the gate with a handmade sign that welcomed Koltes in
German: Willkommen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have known them even without the sign,'' Koltes said.
</P>
<P>
   They talked nonstop on the four-hour drive to Dothan. On Sunday,
they'll drive to a beach rental in Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures and maps were scattered across Byrd's long dining
table. Three German-English dictionaries bought from
Books-A-Million were shared eagerly. In the living room, Sue Byrd
served Koltes a bottle of Samuel Adams beer. With insistant
Southern hospitality, she later poured him a glass of Miller High
Life from a shimmering gold can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nein, nein,'' Koltes politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him not to argue with his mother,'' Sue Byrd said to
Cantey, the translator.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a German railroad worker, Koltes is the youngest of
five children. During the war, his father was a soldier, captured
by the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this story of my rescue many times when I was growing
up,'' Koltes said. ``But after my parents died, we didn't talk
about it much. When you're really, really busy, you don't think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother died in 1985, his father in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me that my life depended on those soldiers,''
Koltes said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Byrd, Biggs and Binette, Koltes wondered what had happened
after the Americans left.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did not know where to start, how to find them,'' Koltes
said. ``The soldiers knew it happened in Baldringen, but I didn't
have any idea where the soldiers were.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, after Byrd tracked him down, people in the
village have taken to calling Koltes the ``Wunderbaby of
Baldringen.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd recounted his war story in a letter to Baldringen Mayor
Willi Emser. Cantey translated. Emser asked around and found
Susanne Thinnes, an 87-year-old village resident. Now the eldest
person in town, she told Emser she was at the church the day
Koltes' mother took the carriage from Byrd and Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   Information flowed through e-mails, letters and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never did I expect a letter from America, and now I send my
letter to you,'' Thinnes wrote to Byrd on June 2, her neat
penmanship producing blue cursive strokes of German words. ``I can
remember a lot from that time. It was the 27th of February when the
American soldiers came to Baldringen. The inhabitants waited
tensely for what was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, all the people had to get out of their houses and meet
in front of the church. So did Frau Koltes and her family. She was
not allowed to go back into the house to get her child, and had to
go with her heavy heart to the assembly point. I remember very well
that she was very upset because she had to leave the baby back all
by itself. . . . The little Josef Koltes survived all his events
and grew into a man. Four times he became a father, and now he is a
grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Byrd invited Koltes to Dothan for an improbable
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be Herr Koltes,'' Byrd said, ``but he's the baby to
me.''

   RACE-HOUSTON (Houston) _ In Houston, the fourth-largest city in
the U.S., blacks, Anglos and Hispanics each make up roughly a third
of the population. So the election in 1998 of Lee P. Brown as the
city's first black mayor was more than a celebration of victory for
blacks. It was also a testament to how racial and ethnic groups in
Houston had put aside their suspicions and rivalries and come
together largely out of self-interest to achieve power. By Mireya
Navarro.

   RACE-COPS-DRUGS (New York) _ On Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m.,
there wasn't a single narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem.
Everyone was being held inside on standby in case of a race riot.
The Amadou Diallo verdict was about to come down. The whites _
officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and Detectives Lee Macklowe and
John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo officers would be found not
guilty. The blacks _ detectives like Johnny Gonzalez and the
undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they should be found guilty on
at least some counts. No case in recent years has hit the police
closer to home. The 1998 killing of a black man by four panicky
white policemen touched every narcotics officer _ black and white _
to the core. By Michael Winerip.

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop blossomed into the center
of youth culture, Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it
a way to flee their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more
provocative one. He regarded hip-hop as a bold modern hope to ease
some of the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young
black man, had never met Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. By N.R.
Kleinfield.

   RACE-SPORTS (Baton Rouge, La.) _ In July 1996, Southern
University, a powerhouse among black colleges, desperately needed a
quarterback, and a white player, Marcus Jacoby, badly needed a
place to play quarterback. Southern's head coach, Pete Richardson,
recruited Jacoby. The decision made headlines. So began an odyssey
of triumph and defeat on and off the football field. By Ira Berkow.

   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ Carl Chancellor and Bob Dyer were
part of a team of reporters for The Akron Beacon Journal that had
explored the racial attitudes of this city. Their series earned the
paper the Pulitzer Prize. The Beacon Journal also tried to lead by
example, and shortly after the series ended, it introduced a lineup
of columnists reflecting ``the perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put
it. They included a black woman and a white woman as well as
Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is white. The paper, it
seemed, had become a proud model of racial enlightenment. Which
made it all the more startling when just a year later, the
jubilation began to fade. By Dana Canedy.

that by putting a Chinese immigrant's son and two descendants of
slaves atop the governing pyramid of the state, Washington state
has transcended race. But if the old racial order has eroded, a
more complex one has replaced it, and now the system rewards
nonwhites who know how to make the largely white electorate see in
them what the voters see in themselves. By Timothy Egan.

the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. By Kevin Sack.

apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by a far

   RACE-WEB-ENTREPRENEUR (Atlanta) _ Timothy Fitzgerald Stevenson
Cobb Jr. and his partner, Jeff Levy, had built an Internet research
company in Atlanta and by May 1999 each man's net worth had swelled
by about $25 million. It conferred an uncommon distinction on Cobb:
He became one of the country's few black Internet millionaires. The
racial backdrop to Cobb's accomplishments went largely unmentioned

second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs, one of the only places in this
muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than

old plantation, eight simple cabins stood in a field of clover.
Generations of whitewash were peeling in ugly patches from the
mud-brick walls. All but one front porch had rotted away, and there
were gaping holes where doors and windows used to be. Obscured by
rows of live oaks, the cabins had been forgotten by many and
ignored by most. There was almost nothing left _ except the stories
of the slaves who once lived in them. Will re-enactments of slave
life at a former plantation, now a national park, help to heal
racial wounds _ or open them? By Ginger Thompson.

happens everywhere, but what is striking is that it happens even
here, where the school district is extraordinarily mixed. But as if
pulled by internal magnets, black and white children begin to
separate at sixth grade. These are children who walked to school
together, learned to read together, slept over at each other's
houses. But race becomes as much a fault line in their world as in
the world their parents hoped to move beyond. By Tamar Lewin.

STUDY FINDS CHEMOTHERAPY IMPAIRS WOMEN'S THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some breast cancer patients score lower on mental tests during
and after chemotherapy, apparently confirming that the problem of
fuzzy thinking that patients call ``chemo-brain'' is real, a new
Canadian study has found.
</P>
<P>
   The level of impairment suggested by the study means that
doctors and patients should take it into account when making
treatment decisions, said the researchers from Princess Margaret
Hospital in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are seeing real effects here,'' said Dr. Ian F.
Tannock, an oncologist at Princess Margaret, Canada's largest
cancer center.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added emphatically, ``I worry that this will be
misinterpreted by groups of women with breast cancer as a reason
for not taking chemotherapy. That is the last thing we would want,
he said. Such a decision is ``always one of balancing risks and
benefits,'' Tannock said.
</P>
<P>
   Other oncologists agreed, and said that the problem of
post-treatment mental impairment should only be a consideration for
women who were considering chemotherapy to slightly improve an
already-good prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   Tannock and his colleagues found that, compared to normal
healthy volunteers, the women who were receiving chemo or had
undergone it a year or more previously did significantly worse on
cognitive tests, particularly those involving verbal performance
and memory.
</P>
<P>
   The effects were more pronounced in women undergoing chemo at
the time than in those who were a year or more out from the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issue of the Journal of
Clinical Oncology, involved 107 women: 31 breast cancer patients
currently getting chemo, 40 patients who had completed chemo
therapy an average of two years previously, and 36 healthy women
who served as controls. The chemo patients were receiving standard
doses of the drugs rather than the high-dose chemotherapy that has
already been linked to impaired thinking and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Each person was asked to perform tasks requiring memory,
concentration, planning verbal and motor skills. They also took
tests of their mood to exclude the possibility that the patients
were depressed, which could reduce their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their test scores, the women were rated as normal
or borderline, mildly, moderately or severely impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that 12 of the 31 current chemo patients had
severe impairment and 3 had moderate impairment. Of the 40
previous-chemo patients, 9 showed severe impairment and 11 had
moderate. Of the 36 healthy control volunteers, four rated severely
impaired and the remainder were either normal or showed mild
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is one of only a few that have looked at the
problem. Tannock said his interested was piqued several years ago
when a patient told him, ``In our support group, we're all talking
about how this chemo stuff addles our brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Tannock said he has launched a much larger study of the problem
and hopes to pin down exactly which part of the treatment is to
blame. Patients typically are given a combination of chemo drugs
and may also be taking hormone treatments and drugs designed to
reduce nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Winer, a breast cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute in Boston, said that some of his patients complain
of poorer memory, but added that he's not yet convinced by any of
the studies that chemotherapy is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are occasional patients who say it's really bothersome
to them, but you wonder whether it is related to the chemo or to
something going on in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Winer said, ``there have been enough reports of
this that I think we need to look at this issue more. It's not
something we can ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   At North Shore Cancer Center in Peabody, Mass., Dr. Joel
Schwartz said that neither he nor his colleagues recalled breast
cancer patients complaining of mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Winer, he said he believed the issue should be studied
``because it's something we need to tell our patients about before
chemotherapy'' if it is found to be a significant risk.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way, Schwartz said, the debate is a sign of progress
in the fight against breast cancer. He noted that 20 years ago the
issue was ``whether we could cure the disease. Now that we are
beginning to cure patients, we have the luxury of saying, what are
we doing to their quality of life?''

 &HT;    Coke moves bias suit to federal court
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola took its first step Friday to defend itself
in a $1.5 billion discrimination suit by notifying plaintiffs'
attorneys Willie Gary and Johnnie Cochran that it moved the case
from state court to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The removal to federal court places the recently filed suit by
four black women in the same venue as a class-action bias suit that
has been playing out for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claims made in this lawsuit are primarily federal claims
and, therefore, should be heard and ruled on in federal court,''
said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch. ``This removal is a very
routine and common procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary's law firm said it will oppose the change. ``We will
file the appropriate legal documentation in federal court to
attempt to have the case remanded back to state court,'' said
Tricia C. K. Hoffler, an attorney in Gary's office.
</P>
<P>
   No hearing or judicial ruling was required before Coke removed
the case to federal court, Hoffler explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a judicial ruling will be necessary to determine whether
removal of the case was proper, once we file our pleadings,'' she
said. ``The issues presented in this case are ripe for state court,
and the state claims predominate the federal claims. Either way,
whether in state or federal court, we will seek justice on behalf
of our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case stays in federal court, it could be handled by U.S.
District Judge Richard Story, who has been presiding over the
class-action suit. Earlier this week, Story placed restrictions on
Gary's Florida law firm, prohibiting it from soliciting or entering
into any fee agreements stemming from the class-action case until
terms of a final settlement are announced in late October.
Individual class members can ``opt out'' of the settlement, which
is being negotiated by another group of plaintiffs' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Gary and Cochran filed the state suit on behalf of
the four former employees, who allege a total of nine claims
against the company. The claims include creating a hostile and
discriminatory work environment, engaging in intentional infliction
of emotional harm, and negligent supervision, hiring and retention.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on June 14 _ the same day Coke and the other
group of plaintiffs' attorneys announced an agreement in principle
to settle the class-action federal suit on behalf of 2,000
African-American employees. That suit alleged that the company
discriminated against current and former workers in pay, promotions
and performance evaluations. Coca-Cola denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's highest-ranking black executive questioned the
timing of the second suit when it was filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to view it as anything but blatant and disruptive
legal maneuvering, seeking to forestall the progress made in the
other lawsuit,'' Carl Ware, the company's executive vice president
for global public affairs, said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffler dismissed Ware's statement as ``false and
self-serving.''

PRIZE-WINNING CHINESE FILM ATTACKED BY CENSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When Jiang Wen's powerful wartime film, ``Devils on
the Doorstep,'' won the Grand Prize in Cannes _ second only to the
festival's Palme d'Or _ in May, the word was that he faced trouble
with China's film censors.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, that seems an understatement. His film
languishes unscreened, officially condemned for political reasons
that seem drastically out of kilter with China's increasingly
buoyant and sophisticated society.
</P>
<P>
   He has also fought with his investors over their demands, on
commercial grounds, to shorten the two-hour 40-minute movie.
</P>
<P>
   And now Jiang, one of China's most acclaimed actors as well as a
second-time director _ he starred in Zhang Yimou's classic ``Red
Sorghum'' in 1987 and the recent hit television series ``Beijingers
in New York'' _ sounds utterly despondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too much like a Hitchcock thriller,'' Jiang, 37, said
in an interview. ``There's terror all around me, but I can't see
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Jiang said, he has never been officially notified of
the long list of demands made by the notoriously conservative Film
Bureau. The bureau vets all scripts of films made in China and then
must approve the finished product for release, often nit-picking
scripts and nixing topics that can be broached in newspapers,
magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said that the film's producers, Asia Union Film and
Entertainment Co. of Hong Kong and China Film Co-Production Co., a
required government-run partner that ushers foreign companies
through the bureaucratic maze, had been instructed not to show him
the Film Bureau's document.
</P>
<P>
   More ominous, Jiang and his friends have heard repeated rumors
that the Film Bureau plans to bar him from making or acting in
films for many years. He said he has tried to meet with the
authorities to discuss the matter, but has been repeatedly
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the bureau's Film Censorship Committee, Zhou
Jiandong, said Friday: ``The film hasn't been banned; it just
hasn't passed the inspection process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This film has lots of problems,'' Zhou said in a telephone
interview. ``It was shown at a film festival abroad without prior
approval, which is a clear violation. This film is at odds with a
number of regulations concerning film content and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rumors that Jiang might be barred from making
new films, the official would only say: ``We're still dealing with
the matter. I can't say how they will resolve these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Devils on the Doorstep,'' which features Jiang as an actor as
well as director, tells the story of a wounded Japanese soldier
held prisoner by Chinese villagers in the last winter of World War
II, as the Japanese invasion is crumbling. In a story replete with
ironies and cultural misunderstandings, most of the villagers treat
the man well for a time, before they decide to trade him back to
the Japanese for grain.
</P>
<P>
   The rapacious Japanese occupation of China is a deeply sensitive
historical topic here, a source of persistent personal bitterness
and of frosty exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese
governments. This has led to contradictory attacks on Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the film was completed, government censors, not
known for their appreciation of irony, began demanding that he
change the title, apparently worried that characterizing the
Japanese as ``devils'' might cause a furor. His producers urged him
to find a new title, too, worried about alienating potential
Japanese viewers as well as about Beijing's approval. But Jiang
would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the points raised by the censors in their review
of the finished movie involve its failure to paint every character
in politically correct colors. Copies of the April 21 appraisal
have been faxed around Beijing and it has even appeared on the
Internet. It reads almost like a parody of censorship from the
heyday of Mao's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese military anthem is played many times throughout
the film,'' the multipage letter says. ``This signifies the
strength of the Japanese military and severely hurts the feelings
of the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are called `chink pigs' by the Japanese many times
throughout the film,'' it says. ``This severely damages the image
of China.''
</P>
<P>
   More generally, this ``Official Opinion from the Film Censorship
Committee of the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television'' complains that too many Chinese in the film behave in
a friendly manner toward the Japanese, ``creating the impression
that Chinese civilians neither hated nor resisted the Japanese
invaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is berated for changing previously approved scenes and for
failing to make previously demanded changes in the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shot of a naked female,'' the letter says. ``In
general, the style of the film is too vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's producers are invited to resubmit the film after
complying with a long list of demands for cuts and changes, and so
far the matter remains at an impasse. But given the sweeping
condemnation, it is hard to see how Jiang could make the film
acceptable, even if he tried.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I feel pulled in all directions and my will has been
completely exhausted,'' Jiang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a filmmaker,'' he said. ``I wanted to show how people
react under extreme danger, how Chinese and Japanese responded and
how, in the middle of a war, people can lose all humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never expected it would become so tangled up and
politicized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's plight is hardly unique. Since the mid-1990s, the Film
Bureau has if anything tightened its grip on filmmaking, causing
anguish and humiliating choices for many directors, sending some
abroad and influencing others to stick with innocuous topics.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds of convention, prudery and ideological correctness
imposed on domestically made movies seem all the more outdated
considering some of the Hollywood films that are approved for
showing _ and which are clobbering domestic films at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the up to 10 foreign films allowed in each year are the
likes of ``Gladiator'' and ``Titanic,'' adventures and romances.
But one of this spring's biggest hits in China was ``The General's
Daughter,'' which features a woman's corpse, naked and
spread-eagled on the grass, and discussions of kinky sex that would
never be allowed in a Chinese film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right to portray Americans as decadent,'' explained
one movie fan here with a laugh.

HEADHUNTERS TURN A FEW ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By REED ABELSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have been bidding up more than dot-coms into the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a labor market squeezed tightly by the demands of a robust
economy and the Internet, stocks of executive search firms have
been spectacular performers of late. The stock of Korn/Ferry
International has more than doubled since the company went public
in February of last year, while Heidrick &AMP; Struggles International,
which made its debut two months later, has nearly quadrupled. TMP
Worldwide, which went public in 1996, has since increased more than
fivefold, more than doubling in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition for talent is incredible,'' said Mitchell
Rubin, a portfolio manager for Baron Capital, which owns these
stocks. He credits the strong economy and a fundamental shift
toward information-based businesses. ``Right now is nirvana,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By combining traditional search businesses with the promise of
the Internet through online recruiting ventures, these companies
appear to be making good on the promise of ``bricks into clicks,''
said Mary Lisanti, the chief investment officer for equities at
Pilgrim Advisors, which owns both Korn/Ferry and Heidrick.
</P>
<P>
   But while these firms are benefiting tremendously from boom
times, and their close but not too-close proximity to the
technology sector, some analysts and investors worry about the
impact when the economy slows down. These companies have been in an
``upward spiral,'' said Kenneth Broad, a portfolio manager for
Franklin Templeton Investments, who has passed on these stocks.
``If and when they trip, there's a downward spiral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The climb has surpassed expectations and shows no sign of ending
anytime soon. Revenue of the 25 largest firms nearly doubled since
1996, to about $1.3 billion at the end of 1999, according to
Hunt-Scanlon Advisors, a Stamford, Conn., firm that tracks the
recruiting industry. Hunt-Scanlon predicts that industry revenue
will grow at least 15 to 20 percent in 2000 and that online
recruiting will become an $8 billion industry by 2005, up from only
$250 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the world's largest
executive recruiter, said it expected to report in early August a
gain of more than 40 percent in quarterly revenue _ as well as
higher-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The search business, already expanding overseas, could see
explosive global growth as the Internet catches on. Recruiting in
Latin America, Europe and Asia ``is going to be the next big
phenomenon,'' said Brian P. Lee, chief marketing strategist at
Hunt-Scanlon. As if to underscore the point, last week Vicente Fox
Quesada, the Mexican president-elect, hired Korn/Ferry to help him
fill key government positions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have already been impressed with the online efforts of
some companies. Heidrick offers LeadersOnline.com, which combines
traditional search techniques with online tools; Korn/Ferry's
Futurestep.com is aimed at middle managers.
</P>
<P>
   TMP Worldwide's claim to fame online is its popular Monster.com
job board, for anyone seeking a job. The company has teamed with
America Online to offer help-wanted ads and provides an inexpensive
way to recruit, said Ann Miletti, an associate portfolio manager at
Strong Capital, which owns TMP shares. ``As a firm, we use the
Monster board, too,'' Miletti said. The site says it has 15.2
million unique visits a month.
</P>
<P>
   While some investors feel that the search companies' stocks are
not yet priced to an extreme, the market has certainly been kind.
Heidrick now trades at $68.46875, nearly 46 times its estimated
earnings per share for this year. Korn/Ferry closed at $34, for a
comparable multiple of 31. TMP, which represents more of a bet on
its ability to remain the dominant Web site, trades at $77.0625, or
a comparable multiple of 87.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced that search firms make for good
public companies. Competitors like Spencer Stuart and Russell
Reynolds Associates have chosen to remain private _ at least for
now. ``The market is very fickle,'' said Joseph Griesedieck, the
chief executive of Spencer Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   While the current business environment puts a high value on
these companies' services, investors have not always been so
generous. If the search business slows, they could be quick to
punish the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, search firms have had trouble navigating public waters
when times were not so good. Korn/Ferry, for example, was a public
company briefly in the early 1970s before choosing to go private
again. LAI Worldwide, formerly Lamalie Associates, which was the
only public search firm for a time, was a dismal stock market
performer that was bought last year by TMP.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also make huge demands of public companies. ``As a
public firm, there is a tremendous amount of pressure to grow your
revenues,'' said Lee. By contrast, the private firms ``can be a lot
more selective in the assignments they take on,'' he said. Russell
Reynolds and Spencer Stuart, for example, boast higher revenues per
consultant than the public companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue for the search industry is the general prohibition
against raiding one client company to find an executive for
another. That makes it difficult to become too large a player,
because too many places are off-limits, Broad said. ``It's a
natural catch-22 for growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if the Internet frenzy or the overall economy
comes to a screeching halt? While few people predict a major
slowdown anytime soon, these companies would be affected if fewer
people were hopping from job to job. The level of vulnerability,
however, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are cyclical stocks in the sense that the labor market is
tight,'' said Miletti of Strong Capital. But she and the other
proponents of these stocks argue that these companies would prove
fairly resilient in any downturn, especially given their online
activities. ``The costs are so much less, it's compelling,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Broad of Franklin Templeton is not sure. Some companies,
like Korn/Ferry and Heidrick, are sometimes paid in stock warrants
by start-up clients. While that has benefited them as many stocks
have soared, a downturn could act ``like a magnifying glass on the
stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which might make for a pretty hard landing.

INVESTING WITH: ROBERT FRIEDMAN OF MUTUAL EUROPEAN FUND

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years in the wilderness, value investing is staging a
comeback, and Robert Friedman, who runs the $926.7 million Mutual
European fund, is basking in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good days for value investors,'' Friedman said from
his office in Short Hills, N.J. ``Europeans are running good
companies with solid, often global businesses at a time when boards
of directors are willing to restructure companies that need it. The
confluence makes this better than any other time in European
business history.''
</P>
<P>
   His investors are having good days, too. The fund returned 21.6
percent a year, on average, for the three years through June 30,
compared with 14.9 percent for all Europe stock funds, according to
Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, 41, takes a bottom-up approach to picking stocks,
seeking good but out-of-favor companies that are selling at cheap
prices. Ideally, he wants to buy shares at less than 60 percent of
what he thinks they are worth today.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for evidence of a catalyst that will push up a stock
price toward a company's intrinsic worth, like aggressive new
management or good prospects for merger, consolidation or a major
revamping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is in its infancy in the reorganization of companies,''
Friedman said. ``Capital markets are opening up, and governments
are more willing to let companies restructure. Even Western
European countries with strong histories of socialism now recognize
the need for corporate access to capital markets and the importance
of company shares being properly valued.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fund has no geographic mandates, most of the companies
it holds are in Western Europe. About a quarter of the portfolio is
in British stocks, 20 percent in Scandinavia and 15 percent in
France; there are smaller concentrations elsewhere. The fund is
always at least 80 percent hedged against currency fluctuations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By Friedman's reckoning, large-capitalization stocks are
becoming overvalued in Europe, though less so than in the United
States. So he is now focusing on companies with market caps of $400
million to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In evaluating a company's finances, Friedman is less concerned
about revenue growth than profitability. ``If a company has good
margin improvement on stagnant sales growth,'' he said,
``management is doing serious cost-cutting or restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman brings an American-style activist approach, a hallmark
of the Mutual Series funds, to the fund's relationship with
companies in the portfolio. ``Shareholder activism will be very
important in European markets going forward, because of the growing
awareness on the part of institutional investors that management
works for shareholders,'' he said, adding that Continental Europe
was lagging behind Britain in adapting to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He sells stocks when discounts begin to shrink. When shares
reach 60 to 90 percent of what he believes they are worth, ``it's
time to take money off the table,'' he said. And when they reach
their full value, ``we are largely gone.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friedman sees bargains among European financial and engineering
companies.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, he says, is Irish Life and Permanent, an insurer
with a small presence in the United States. ``Ireland has been the
tiger economy of Western Europe because of low tax rates,
business-friendly government, economic growth in the upper single
digits and inflation of less than 3 percent,'' he said, adding that
demand for insurance is growing. For this company, he said, the
catalyst is a potential rebound of the country's financial services
sector, which was hurt earlier this year by rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman bought Irish Life, which trades in London, at prices
between 4.70 pounds and 5.70 pounds and figures its true worth at
about 10 pounds; it closed on Friday at 5.36 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Powell Duffryn, a British conglomerate with
specialty engineering and port services businesses. Friedman said
it ought to be worth more than 7 pounds a share; it now trades at
4.68 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He took a small initial position at 6 pounds in early 1999, but
rising interest rates depressed port revenue early this year, and
the stock price slumped, letting Friedman scoop up more shares at
prices of 3.50 pounds to 4 pounds. He forecasts earnings growth of
12 to 15 percent a year, he said, because ``management has really
restructured the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman also likes Internatio-Muller N.V., a Dutch engineering
company specializing in plant design and construction that has
agreed to merge with a local rival, Stork N.V., and sell off much
of its business. Friedman opposes the timing of the merger; he
wants Internatio-Muller to divest its assets first, pay a dividend
to shareholders with the proceeds and then complete the merger.
Dutch law provides little recourse to block the merger, he said, so
he is trying to win over company management to his approach
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, he said, the fund will profit. ``There's
too much hidden value not to make money here,'' he said, ``but not
as much as if they postpone the merger until after the sale.'' He
got in at about 20 euros a share in May, and puts the company's
intrinsic worth at 18 to 25 euros before the sale and at 30 euros
after. It closed on Friday at 18.4 euros.

AFTER COURT'S RULING, RAILROAD MERGER WILL PROBABLY NOT HAPPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. and Canadian railroads that were planning to combine
resources to create a rail system spanning North America lost a
court appeal Friday and will probably end up scuttling their
proposed $6 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Washington upheld a temporary ban on railroad
consolidations that was imposed in March by the Surface
Transportation Board of the United States. The board had frozen
action on all mergers after the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.
and the Canadian National Railway Co. announced plans to put
together a vast freight network that would crisscross the United
States and Canada and offer service into Mexico, too. Their merger
would have been the largest in railroad history.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads argued that the board lacked the authority to
impose such a ban and could only approve or reject merger
applications. But the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in a 2-1 decision released Friday morning, ruled that the
board had not exceeded its statutory authority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively upheld the ban that began on March 17 _
the day the board originally imposed the moratorium _ and runs
until June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement released Friday, the two railroads
expressed disappointment over the court's decision but did not
signal their next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither BNSF nor CN will speculate about its options,'' the
statement said. ``The managements of CN and BNSF will discuss the
ruling's implications for their proposed business combination, and
each will consult its respective board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies already have quarterly board meetings scheduled
for this month. The BNSF board is to meet on July 20, and the CN
board on July 24. Spokesmen for both railroads refused to discuss
whether the future of the proposed merger or any further legal
action, including a request for a rehearing or a filing with the
Supreme Court, would be discussed at those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are almost certain that the deal will be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said James M.
Higgins, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. He said that
the Burlington Northern board in particular was impatient and
unwilling to be held up for more than a year, during which anything
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments shortly after the ban was imposed and the
railroads had filed their appeal, Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of
Burlington Northern, expressed doubts that the deal would go
forward if the moratorium was not overturned. In answer to a
question at a luncheon in Washington on March 24, Krebs said that
the economic climate in the industry would change so much during
the postponement that the proposed merger would probably no longer
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   At that same luncheon, Krebs also expressed concerns about the
Surface Transportation Board's announced plans to consider new
rules and regulations governing mergers that would be different
from those under which the venture had been planned by the two
railroads. And he said that the uncertainty generated by such a
long delay would hurt investors and further depress the rail lines'
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The board itself acknowledged that financial markets would react
negatively to a moratorium, but it found that danger would be
outweighed by the potential consequences of moving forward
``without appropriate rules in place at the beginning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the plans were disclosed in December, railroad stock
prices have gyrated wildly in reaction to predictions about what
federal regulators in Washington would do. Overall, Burlington
Northern shares have fallen more than 5 percent this year, while
Canadian National declined a bit over 1 percent. Both were up
slightly Friday as investors responded positively to the court's
action because they believed that some of the uncertainty that has
dogged the rail lines since the merger was proposed had been
lifted. Shares of Burlington Northern rose 68.75 cents, to
$26.9375, while Canadian National also jumped 68.75, to $30.75.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the plans of the two large carriers to
create a coast-to-coast, cross-border rail network have been both
praised and condemned. The new system would include 50,000 miles of
track and combined annual revenue of $12.5 billion. Analysts liked
the fact that despite their huge dimensions, the two systems
overlapped in few places. Railroad executives promised that few
jobs or miles of parallel track would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the vision of a transcontinental railroad came just as
shippers and manufacturers that use the rails were adjusting to a
previous round of mergers that had greatly disrupted service and
left a large number of rail clients unhappy. Many feared that the
Burlington-Canadian National combination would bring on even more
mergers and leave North America with just two very large national
railroads, which would decrease competition and lower the
responsiveness of the railroads to client needs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators in Washington believe that more consolidation
is likely in the rail industry. They say they imposed the
moratorium to review regulations and make sure the industry
develops in an orderly way.

A CELL-PHONE COMPANY AT OLD-ECONOMY PRICES

<P>
   What should investors make of Audiovox, the mobile telephone
handset provider that has been called the poor man's Qualcomm?
Though Audiovox, based in Hauppauge, N.Y., has been reporting
stellar sales growth and has surpassed earnings expectations for
three quarters, the stock, having soared through March, is now down
32 percent this year, compared with a 10.7 percent climb in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's Communications Equipment index.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons include strong competition, falling profit margins
and the company's dependence on a single customer for the bulk of
its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked next to Qualcomm, a much-better-known maker of cellular
telephones (as well as chip sets) that became a Wall Street
darling, Audiovox remains inexpensive, now trading at $31.375,
about 17 times its estimated 2001 earnings of $1.89 a share.
Qualcomm, meanwhile, is trading at 46 times 2001 estimates of $1.37
a share, even after falling by about two-thirds this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the two control similar pieces of the $48.4 billion North
American market for handsets. In 1999, Audiovox had 10 percent,
while Qualcomm had 11.2 percent, according to Dataquest, a market
tracker.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some investors saw Audiovox as a bargain. ``It was
a cheap way to play Qualcomm,'' said Jayne Stevlingson, a portfolio
manager for the Oppenheimer Discovery fund. But she is now having
doubts, and has sold 50,000 of her 300,000 Audiovox shares.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Alpers, a senior portfolio manager at Navellier Fund
Management, has also pulled back, citing the stock's difficulty in
breaking past the high $20s. ``Fundamentally, everything looks
good, so it's kind of a mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, Audiovox stock struggled to break $10, as the
company was still best known for its decidedly unsexy car audio
equipment. Car electronics now makes up only 20 percent of the
business, with handsets accounting for the rest. By March 7 of this
year, less than a month after it sold 3.1 million shares at $45
each in a secondary offering, the stock had reached a record of
$72.50. Then, amid the selloff in technology stocks, Audiovox fell
further and faster than most.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strongest defender is John J. Shalam, 67, the
entrepreneur who turned his $15,000 investment 35 years ago into a
company that reported $1.16 billion in sales last year, an 89
percent increase over 1998. ``We don't think the ride was justified
to $72 because that's not realistic,'' Shalam, the chief executive,
said recently, just after trying to shore up his support at a
meeting for analysts and investors in Manhattan. ``But we believe
that it deserves to trade at $40 to $50.''
</P>
<P>
   The five analysts who follow the stock, including four whose
firms were involved in the secondary offering, recently raised
their earnings expectations for Audiovox. All but one have strong
buys on the stock. ``Compared with its competitors who are trading
at 47 times 2001 earnings, this company is clearly undervalued,''
said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist for Spencer Clarke,
an investment boutique in Manhattan that did not help underwrite
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts' consensus is that Audiovox will earn $1.64 a share
for the current fiscal year, which ends on Nov. 30, and $1.89 a
share in 2001. But last month, the analysts lowered their 52-week
price targets to $40 to $50 a share from as high as $70.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, among others, says he remains concerned about the
company's falling margins. In 1998, Audiovox had gross margins, or
profits before interest and taxes, of 14.4 percent. Last year, they
fell to 11.6 percent; most analysts expect them to go below 10
percent this year as competitors cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that up to 80 percent of Audiovox's handset
sales are to one customer, Verizon Communications, the combined
Bell Atlantic-GTE cellular service provider. Shalam said that
having so many orders in hand from Verizon helped the company avoid
having excess inventory. But Stevlingson worries that ``when you
have one customer that controls 80 percent of your revenue, they're
basically telling you what to price it at.'' &UR;

TALKS PAUSE FOR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The scene sounds a little like summer camp:
Delegates drive to and fro on golf carts. Staff members go bowling
during their free time. On sunny days, officials sometimes hold
meetings on the back porch.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is essential to the Camp David experience, and the
reason President Clinton chose to hold this week's Middle East
peace talks here. Nestled in a wooded retreat in the Catoctin
Mountains, sometime-enemies are not only hidden from the eyes of
the world. They are also, officials said, relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   That atmosphere will become especially critical Saturday, as the
Israeli delegation takes a break from the official talks to observe
the Jewish Sabbath, a 24-hour period during which they are not
permitted to do work. Under normal circumstances, that means
abandoning all rituals of the modern office, such as fax machines
and paperwork. But at Camp David, officials said the setting will
allow Israeli negotiators to observe the Sabbath and also carry on
with their main task: having informal conversations with Americans
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak the whole Sabbath,'' said Rabbi Michael Melchior, a
member of the Israeli cabinet who serves as minister of disapora
affairs. ``What better (discussion) to have than one that brings
more peace?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marks the the fifth day of the summit, which has been
conducted in total secrecy as Israelis and Palestinians try to
settle their half-century conflict over a variety of issues,
including the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian
refugees, and control of Israeli-occupied territory on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. One US official said Friday that ``at times,
discussions are tense.'' But few details of the negotiations have
thus far been divulged.
</P>
<P>
   According to an anonymous source quoted by Reuters news service,
Arafat threatened to walk out of the talks on Thursday night, after
US envoy Dennis Ross presented him with a verbal proposal on the
future of a Palestinian state, control over Jerusalem, and
refugees. Arafat reportedly only agreed to remain in the
negotiations after Clinton intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a crisis during the talks (Thursday) and Arafat
ordered his delegation to pack their bags to leave Camp David in
anger at American proposals which were identical to the Israeli
position,'' Reuters quoted the source as saying. ``President
Clinton calmed Arafat down and the Palestinian leader agreed to
stay only after the Americans withdrew their proposals. They are
expected to submit new proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, obeying their self-imposed news blackout,
refused to discuss what had taken place. But White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart denied reports originating with Palestinian officials
about Arafat's threat to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't witnessed any deterioration,'' Lockhart said. ``I
didn't see any luggage today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart did, however, report one curious detail: That two
negotiators had gotten into a minor accident in their golf carts
Thursday night. He declined to say who they were, but he did say
they were from the same country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton returned Thursday from a day of meetings
outside the compound to hold a back-porch meeting with Shlomo Ben
Ami, the Israeli minister of internal security. Clinton then walked
to dinner at a nearby cabin, where he dined at 8:30 p.m. with 30 or
so members of both delegations, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent all day Friday in bilateral talks, meeting
separately with both Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the talks were ``very, very difficult.'' And they
cannot continue indefinitely; the Palestinian leader has promised
to declare an independent Palestinian state on September 13 if no
agreement is reached. And Clinton has an even earlier deadline: He
is planning to leave for Japan on Wednesday. Although Israeli
officials have suggested they might carry on negotiating without
him, US officials have indicated that possibility is remote.
</P>
<P>
   Those limitations have given the talks this weekend a greater
sense of urgency, making it difficult for the eight-member Israeli
delegation not to participate Saturday at all.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely they will hold any formal conversations, or
even plan meetings, several diplomatic experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak will not negotiate on Saturday,'' said Alon Ben-Meir,
project director for the Middle East at the World Policy Institute.
``If it ever leaked that he did, it would probably end his tenure
as prime minister. That's all the Israelis need is one more excuse
to bring his tenure down by learning he violated the Sabbath.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ben-Meir said, ``The advisors in both camps, they'll be
sitting together, eating in the same dining room, walking around
the paths. And they're going to be talking to each other. But
they're not going to sit down in a formal setting. There's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Aronson, director of the Foundation for Middle East
Peace, agreed. ``I don't think Barak himself has any personal
qualms about sitting down and talking to people on the Sabbath, but
Israeli sensibilities are such that they cannot be seen to be
negotiating officially on Saturday. But who knows what they may
talk about when they shut the door.''

 &HT;    Vols to be test market for Home Depot's college-color paint line
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's been a meeting of the orange-minded in
Knoxville. Four Home Depot stores in University of Tennessee
territory are testing a new line of paint licensed with the
school's signature color. ``Tennessee Orange'' will brighten up
dens, dorm rooms and ``just about anything,'' said Kim Taylor,
assistant manager at the Home Depot on Centerline Drive in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is `Big Orange' country here. We take our football quite
seriously,'' said Taylor, who's considering turning her garage into
a glowing orange hub for watching football on her big screen TV
this fall. ``We've got a local radio station offering to paint an
entire house orange if somebody will let them,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Orange costs about $25 a gallon, the going rate for
designer-brand paint. If it's a hit, Home Depot may consider
licensed colors such as Georgia red, Alabama crimson and others.
Home Depot's announcement said part of the proceeds from paint
sales will benefit the universities, but financial terms weren't
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta designer Karen Castles Gray, president of Castles Sport
Apparel, came up with the idea for the liquid loyalty. Two years
ago, she started marketing a line of college-licensed apparel for
women, which is sold in department stores such as Dillard's and
Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have been asking for collegiate-logoed home decor
products, so I created designs for ``alumni rooms,'' said Castles
Gray, an East Carolina graduate who plans to turn 12 rooms at her
Buckhead residence into a ``designer showroom'' of school colors.
``I'm going to have a Georgia room, a Tennessee room and so on,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The orange-blooded Volunteers were an obvious choice for the
Home Depot launch, Castles Gray said. ``Last fall, we did over a
million dollars in (collegiate apparel) sales just in Knoxville,''
she said. ``I was given one shot to be successful with Home Depot,
and I couldn't think of a school that had more rabid fans than
Tennessee.''

<P>
   KARMEL, West Bank _ Rafat, a skinny 9-year-old too shy to supply
a surname, heads every summer morning to the only swimming hole in
this hardscrabble stretch of the Hebron hills. It is a stark stone
cistern, about 100 feet long and 50 feet across, built long ago to
store the rains that fall only in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Descending a rickety ladder, Rafat and his pals plunge happily
into stagnant water barely 3 feet deep, its surface an unbroken
carpet of brilliant green algae.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our children,'' said Khalil Yunis, mayor of the
nearby town of Yatta, shaking his head at the sight of the small
boys diving under the undulating scum. ``And this is their water.''
</P>
<P>
   The algae-choked pool where Rafat swims is the centerpiece of
the village water system. The other daily water source for Karmel's
3,500 residents is a tiny spring-fed brook that wends its way
through a herd of goats into a newly covered concrete cistern.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers carry pails past a hand-lettered sign in English
and Arabic extolling this modest public-works project,
``implemented by Yatta municipality'' and financed by the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless America,'' Yunis said with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yunis tried to help Karmel further by linking the village to
Yatta's municipal water system, but the summer supply in Yatta is
so low that water now flows through the 3-inch pipe here ``just two
or three days a month,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the West Bank, Yatta gets its water from Israel's
state water company. Disputes over water resources have been a fact
of life here since the land was occupied by Israel 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators now trying to
resolve the issue of water rights, along with all their other
hypercharged disputes _ about refugees, borders, Jerusalem _ the
concern in this parched part of the West Bank is that Israel may
end up retaining its hold on the reserves beneath the bedrock here.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile down the dirt road, Yunis pointed out what is to
him a symbol of the conflict that he hopes the Camp David talks can
resolve: a pristine pumping terminal, protected by a chain-link and
barbed-wire cage, for a large water main supplying a Jewish
settlement town, Maon.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller pipe once channeled some of this water to Karmel, but
the link was severed by settlers, Yunis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is right here, and we can't touch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within plain view of the fenced-in pumping station, outside
another small village, Azam Abugadiah lowered two yellow pails into
a 30-foot well dug a year ago in another local-government effort to
expand water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Four times a day he expertly tips the buckets into the few
remaining inches of standing water, his family's only supply of
drinking water. Next to the nearly dry well, a new storage tank
stands empty, an electric pump is idle and the year-old water meter
shows a long row of zeros.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, water allocation is a zero-sum game, and
Palestinians consider local scarcity a direct and unjust
consequence of the resources given to Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   With their watered lawns and community pools, the 160,000 Jewish
settlers in the West Bank enjoy essentially the same suburban life
as Israelis elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlements, daily water consumption for households and
general urban use is about 74 gallons a person. That is not a lot
by American standards, but it is four times the Palestinian usage.
And during summer droughts, despite public-service calls to
conserve water, there is little real reduction in Israeli household
use. But among Palestinians, water supplies slow to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis make all this fuss about a shortage of water to
wash their cars, and we do not have enough to wash our bodies,''
said Muhammad Amro, an official with the Palestinian local
government ministry in the Hebron region.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says 26.5 gallons of potable water
per person is needed daily for minimal health and sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, where Palestinians control local
government but Israel still controls most of the water resources,
the average consumption is 18.5 gallons daily. In the summer in
towns like Yatta, with water systems connected to Israel's national
network, the supply dwindles to half that or less.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 215,000 Palestinians who live in villages with no
running water rely on trucked-in water bought in most cases from
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Lubell, a spokesman for Btselem, an Israeli human rights
group that brought European diplomats here for meetings with
officials of drought-stricken Palestinian towns, said the
settlements were just part of the problem. The drainage of aquifers
for Israeli industry and agriculture and the lack of serious
water-conservation efforts in Israel's affluent suburbs are the
real sources of the disparity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water issue is not one of the settlers vs. the
Palestinians, but of Israel vs. the Palestinians,'' said Lubell,
whose organization issued a study this month urging radical
cutbacks in Israel's use of underground fresh water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the inch-by-inch negotiating battle for territory here, the
lands that are bitterly disputed are precious and finite. But at
least they are not contracting. Subterranean water reserves, by
contrast, are steadily shrinking as the demands of two fast-growing
societies outpace natural replenishment by rivers and rainfall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As fresh water supplies diminish, brackish water from pools
deeper underground is drawn up into the depleted aquifers,
rendering the reserves undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israeli officials who favor increased allotments to the
Palestinians have argued for continued Israeli control of shared
aquifers beneath the hills here. Israel's acknowledged expertise in
water management can benefit both sides, they contend, and
hydraulics and topography make it easier to tap the main reservoir
from within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians point to Israel's recent warnings that it
may unilaterally cut water supplies promised to Jordan under the
terms of its peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The one point of concurrence between Israeli and Palestinian
water experts is that the aquifers do not hold enough water to
supply both populations at present consumption rates for many more
years.
</P>
<P>
   While Palestinian villagers import Israeli water in tanker
trucks, Israel is seriously considering the emergency importation
of Turkish water in tanker ships, converted for the purpose from
the oil trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli experts deride that proposal as costly and
unsanitary, and say the farms that use most of the country's fresh
water should instead be irrigated with brackish and recycled waste
water.
</P>
<P>
   The only long-term solution, experts agree, is to create more
fresh water. Israel is seeking bids for gas-powered desalting
plants along the Mediterranean. The water-deprived Gaza Strip could
be the biggest beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But in Karmel and other hamlets in the brown hills here, these
projects seem like a distant abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are discussing the problem of water for the next
generation,'' Amro said. ``But if we can't drink the water now,
there will be no next generation.''

 &HT;    SABBATH BRINGS WELCOME BREAK AT SUMMIT AS TENSION GROWS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-0715
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Negotiators at the Camp David peace summit
hosted by President Clinton paused at sundown Friday for a meal
marking the Jewish sabbath, after a tense day of talks between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hunkered down at the presidential retreat, however, for
negotiations expected to heat up again late Saturday and Sunday
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors circulated Friday that Arafat was poised to walk out
of the talks, Clinton sent U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to a nearby town for an emergency meeting with Palestinian
politicians, and the White House warned that negotiations were
``bound to get harder,'' in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met for an hour with the group, six Palestinian
opposition politicians who flew here on their own to urge Arafat to
take a tough stand in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour-long meeting at a federal training facility in
Emmitsburg, Md., Albright sought to tamp down Palestinian
expectations, warning the political figures that Arafat won't get
everything he wants in talks centered on security, territory and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   And, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, Albright told the
group to brace for increasing difficulty in the days ahead, saying
that ``as they work through these issues, this process is bound to
get harder as they move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat have set a Sept. 13 deadline for resolving a
comprehensive set of issues aimed at settling once and for all the
two sides' 52-year-old dispute. Clinton has cleared his schedule to
remain here until Wednesday, when he is slated to fly to Japan for
the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Eight _ the seven
wealthiest democratic countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright sought to calm the worst fears of Palestinians,
negotiators for both sides split into groups in an effort to work
their way issue-by-issue through the contentious slate of divisions
at the root of the 52-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the question of Palestinian statehood,
borders of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem, the
security of Israel and the ability of Palestinian refugees to
return to their homes in lands now under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to confirm reports that U.S. diplomats had
begun to propose suggestions aimed at bridging the gaps between
Israelis and Palestinians, but he made clear that such proposals
are an expected part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would not eliminate any diplomatic initiative, or
effort, that might move the process forward,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, held separate meetings with Barak and
Arafat. The White House released a photo showing Clinton, in blue
jeans and an Arkansas Razorbacks sweatshirt, smiling and listening
to an animated Arafat, wearing his trademark khaki military uniform
and black and white checked kafiyeh, the traditional Arab
headdress.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end Friday, Arafat and Barak had met with each other
just once in four days, with one other meeting among Barak, Arafat
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The three had also had several meals together, though they were
not seated next to each other, said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has thrown a strict news blackout over the
summit, declining to comment in any way on the substance of the
talks and providing scant detail even about atmospherics inside
Camp David. Some 200 media correspondents covering the event are
spending time at a temporary press center set up at the Thurmont
Elementary School, in this town of 4,400 five miles from Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's meeting was not subject to the blackout, however, and
it provided a rare glimpse at the dicey nature of the ongoing
talks.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton to send his top diplomat away from the talks to try
to console Arafat's opponents was, in itself, a signal of the level
of tensions within the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that there is public support for what Chairman
Arafat is doing,'' Lockhart said. Arafat is the chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just as important,'' Lockhart said, ``for Prime Minister
Barak to have public support.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources widely reported Friday that Arafat had
threatened to pack his bags in the face of mounting pressure to
accept painful compromises in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The reports could not be confirmed, but Lockhart told reporters
at a press briefing that no one should be surprised to hear of
negotiators' nerves on needles and pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tensions everyday when you're trying to work through
these difficult issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was expected to be a day of informal discussions among
negotiators, said Lockhart, with talks expected to turn serious
again Saturday evening.

 &HT;    SABBATH BRINGS WELCOME BREAK AT SUMMIT AS TENSION GROWS

   THURMONT, Md. _ Negotiators at the Camp David peace summit
hosted by President Clinton paused at sundown Friday for a meal
marking the Jewish sabbath, after a tense day of talks between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hunkered down at the presidential retreat, however, for
negotiations expected to heat up again late Saturday and Sunday
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As rumors circulated Friday that Arafat was poised to walk out
of the talks, Clinton sent U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to a nearby town for an emergency meeting with Palestinian
politicians, and the White House warned that negotiations were
``bound to get harder,'' in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met for an hour with the group, six Palestinian
opposition politicians who flew here on their own to urge Arafat to
take a tough stand in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour-long meeting at a federal training facility in
Emmitsburg, Md., Albright sought to tamp down Palestinian
expectations, warning the political figures that Arafat won't get
everything he wants in talks centered on security, territory and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   And, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, Albright told the
group to brace for increasing difficulty in the days ahead, saying
that ``as they work through these issues, this process is bound to
get harder as they move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat have set a Sept. 13 deadline for resolving a
comprehensive set of issues aimed at settling once and for all the
two sides' 52-year-old dispute. Clinton has cleared his schedule to
remain here until Wednesday, when he is slated to fly to Japan for
the annual summit of leaders from the Group of Eight _ the seven
wealthiest democratic countries and Russia.
</P>

POLAROID SAYS DIGITAL PRODUCTS BEING SNAPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teenagers who ``listen'' to their camera and insurance agents
who snap a digital picture and press a button for an instant
photograph are the target audiences for a gaggle of new Polaroid
products that the company expects will push sales growth up by at
least 10 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision I have is the same as Dr. Land for taking really
complicated technology and making it simple and easy to use,'' said
Gary DiCamillo, Polaroid chief exectuive, referring to Edwin Land,
Polaroid's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the company's filmless digital cameras, primarily sold
in Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target stores since December, have already
surpassed the 400,000 units sold in all of 1999. The Cambridge,
Mass. instant-photography leader said five of the 10 best-selling
digital cameras are from Polaroid. And while digital products will
account for 10 percent of Polaroid's revenue over the next three to
four years, it will outpace the growth of instant film products.
</P>
<P>
   Investors remain skeptical of the company that dominates instant
photography _ a technology that is being rapidly replaced by
digital imaging. But while Polaroid commands a large share of the
corporate market for digital identification systems such as state
drivers' licenses, they face stiff competition in marketing digital
products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Polaroid successfully rebounded from recent woes last
year, Wall Street has questioned the company's ability to sustain
growth for the long haul. the company's stock price _ $17.50, up 25
cents Friday _ has been sliding since its September 1999 high of
$30.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The big push into digital photography comes after last year's
successful launch of I-Zone, a low-cost pocket-sized camera and
postage stamp-sized film that appeals to the youth market. Together
with larger cameras, called JoyCam and PopShots, and new instant
films, the combination boosted sales by 7.2 percent to $1.98
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now Polaroid wants to go the next step and leverage its core
instant picture technology platform with digital imaging for
consumers _ particularly in the mobile and wireless marketplace.
That includes developing new kinds of devices, many of them aimed
at the youth market _ and competing against Eastman Kodak Co. and a
cadre of established Japanese digital camera makers such as
Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   By year-end Polaroid expects to begin selling a digital camera
combined with an MP3 player that can store and playback music off
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, digital cameras require a desktop computer printer to
provide paper-based images. Polaroid plans to market a $250
handheld device that uses its film packs to print 2- by 3-inch
images from removable standard memory cards found in most digital
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of its digital cameras are priced between $99 and
$399, a new $800 digital camera with a built-in instant picture
film packs can immediately print out a digital image as well as
store scores of images on digital memory cards. The hybrid system _
first discussed by DiCamillo two years ago _ is aimed at businesses
such as insurance companies and real estate agents. However,
Polaroid is increasing its sales projections based on conversations
with customers and test marketing the unnamed camera system with
high-end consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday DiCamillo also hinted at a new low-cost instant picture
technology for taking digital images and converting them into
paper-based photographs. It would significantly reduce the
company's bread-and-butter $1-per-print instant film, possibly down
to 25 cents for a paper-based image. Company officials said it
probably will show up next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polaroid has done a good job with I-Zone and its other camera
lines, but the problem is we are seeing a slowdown in Japan, with
concerns that some products are fads,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig,
managing director at Salomon Smith Barney. ``We have not seen the
company's ability to translate its success into extraordinary
top-line growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Polaroid has endured some foreign currency
issues and had to divested nearly a dozen small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiCamillo is moving in the right direction, but he has a lot
of competitive hurdles ahead,'' Rosenzweig said. ``Execution _
being able to deliver consistent growth quarter by quarter _ is the
key to everything.''

   The Republican and Democratic national parties reported healthy
bank balances on June 30 as they entered the final pre-election
stretch. The Republican National Committee reported $53.4 million
cash on hand after having raised $86.6 million since Jan. 1. The
Democratic National Committee said it had $35 million in the bank;
it has raised $64.4 million so far this year. The parties benefited
from lucrative fund-raising dinners featuring their leaders. A
dinner honoring Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in April brought in
$21 million; a Democratic salute to President Clinton a month later
yielded $27 million. Both parties said their June 30 figures were
the largest ever at this stage of a campaign and promised to use
their wealth to finance aggressive television advertising
campaigns.

 &HT;    Microsoft chief exec opens Window on new Web world
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The chief executive of America's most important _ and
controversial _ high tech company came to Atlanta on Friday with a
hole in his shoe, a malfunctioning computer and a sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, was the draw for the first-ever
sellout crowd at a Technology Alliance of Georgia event. He told
the audience of 1,400 that Microsoft was placing its bets for the
future on the Internet and on a business called Microsoft.Net.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to transfer many of the functions of the PC to the
Internet, including programs that now require software (which
Microsoft makes) on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the industry as a supersalesman, Ballmer sometimes
abandoned the podium and paced the floor like a tent revival
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I saying that the PC is dead?'' he asked the crowd.
``Noooooooooo. I come from Microsoft and wear the PC tattooed on my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, part of the strategy for Microsoft is that future
versions of Microsoft Windows will incorporate features designed to
add functionality to Microsoft.Net.
</P>
<P>
   The plain-spoken Ballmer said: ``Some people are saying that we
are basing it on Windows. Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Microsoft.Net will also support numerous other
platforms and devices ranging from interactive TV to wireless
palm-size computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a stool toward the end of his speech, Ballmer
unwittingly displayed a hole the size of a quarter in the sole of
his shoe. While not in the same league with the world's richest
man, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, he can afford to replace the
brown loafers. Ballmer is America's 11th richest man with a net
worth as of mid-June of $15.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Undetered and a little amused by a malfunctioning laptop
computer used to display slides illustrating his speech, Ballmer
said America's move to the Internet had been slow and not so
obvious in the beginning, at least not at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Microsoft for 14 years before anyone took the
Internet seriously,'' Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   That's far from the case today. While Ballmer believes the
antitrust ruling that ordered the company's breakup will be
overturned, the move toward Microsoft.Net represents a path for the
company that does not rely so heavily on the dominance of its
Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer believes the Internet now is in the second phase of its
existence. But _ lurking just around the next cyber corner _ is
what he calls Internet Version 3.
</P>
<P>
   As he began to explain Version 3, Ballmer's laptop shut down
again, blacking out the slides that had been projected on the large
screens that flanked him. Minions rushed to the stage and began to
work on the laptop as Ballmer happily narrated the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in power save mode,'' he reported. ``Now it's
rebooting. I like the way that thing shut down so nicely, I'm very
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, without missing a beat, Ballmer shifted back to his text
event as technicians messed with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Version 3 there will be an Internet environment in which
the customers are in control,'' he said. ``Today Web producers are
in control. I want to see my view on the Internet ... my financial
accounts, my files, a world in which the individual is in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the power Microsoft.Net will presumably bring
to the individual, Ballmer said he would be able to create a Web
site and publish it instantly _ without any particular computer
skill. The speed and ease would mean Web sites could be created for
specific purposes, used and then discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I'm going on vacation,'' he said. ``So I have
Myvacation.com. I tell it to book my flight, to put my arrival time
on my sister's calender, and to notify her if my plane is going to
be more than 30 minutes late.''
</P>
<P>
   On his sister's side of the world, her own Web site could filter
the information and if appropriate page her to let her know that
Ballmer's flight would be late.
</P>
<P>
   These interlinking Web sites would become electronic servants
and create what he calls ``a world of cooperating Web sites'' with
the user in control.
</P>
<P>
   As was true last year, Ballmer was in Atlanta to take part in
the Microsoft Fusion event. The event is held by Microsoft each
year in cities _ including Atlanta and San Francisco _ to meet with
companies that are its customers and business partners. Ballmer
also spoke to the TAG group last year.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the TAG crowd, Ballmer said too much money is
being invested in Internet ventures that have little potential for
making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are overinvesting in dot-com startups,''
Ballmer said. ``There has been a hysteria. There is too much money
chasing Internet ideas in the short run.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer declined to talk about Microsoft's quarter that ended
last month or the outlook for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the U.S. economic outlook, he pointed out that
computer maker Gateway Inc., which Friday reported a 36 percent
gain in earnings from higher-profit businesses, had declining sales
to businesses. Gateway said sales to businesses declined 10
percent, reflecting a shift in focus to smaller companies, schools
and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue,'' he told reporters.

CONGRESS TAKES ACTION ON ESTATE TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore calls it a ``do-nothing''
Congress. But these days, it is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have been very busy, in fact, holding
numerous votes and a string of news conferences in recent weeks
aimed at a central goal: drawing clear distinctions between the
Clinton-Gore White House and a future President Bush. And that was
certainly the case Friday, when the Senate voted 59-39 for the
gradual repeal of the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the tax, currently imposed on people who inherit
estates exceeding $675,000, has been a Republican priority for
years. Clinton has repeatedly promised to veto the legislation at
hand, saying it unfairly benefits the rich. And yet this year, with
the Republican National Convention on the horizon, GOP leaders are
more than happy to see their bill die _ both to underscore the
parties' differing views on taxes and to suggest it is really the
Democrats who ``do nothing'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This becomes exhibit A _ or exhibit X _ in the difference
between a Bush presidency and the one Gore aspires to,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki.
``If Bush were president, these bills would become law.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment among Republicans extends far beyond the estate
tax bill. Indeed, with nearly every movement in Congress these days
colored by election-year politics, the Republican-controlled
legislative calendar is increasingly crowded with bills designed to
make a political point as much as to be passed into law.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the estate tax, the Senate next week is expected
to tackle the repeal of the marriage penalty tax _ another bill
doomed to face a veto once it reaches the White House. The marriage
tax bill _ which would adjust the tax code for some 25 million
working married couples who currently pay more than they would if
they were single _ passed the House earlier this year but was later
blocked in the Senate. On Wednesday, the House passed the measure a
second time, 269-169, under a special procedure guaranteeing it
will not be blocked in Congress again.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would cut marriage penalties by $182 billion over
10 years. Next Monday, the Senate is expected to pass a broader
version of the same bill, guaranteeing a $248 billion marriage tax
cut over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans quietly admit the marriage tax itself is not the
point. If anything, they seem eager to prompt a veto. Although
Clinton had offered a compromise, agreeing to sign the marriage tax
bill if Republicans pass his prescription drug coverage proposal
for Medicare, Republicans in the Senate have declined to negotiate.
In the House, a vote on a similar drugs-for-tax-cuts proposal was
defeated this week, 230-197.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a nexus between marriage penalty and
prescription drugs,'' House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said in
explaining the failure of the Democratic proposal. ``They're at
risk of being do-nothing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense is a critical one for House Republicans, who are
waging a fierce battle to retain control of Congress while
supporting Bush, their presumed presidential nominee. The
legislative body has come under recent attack from Gore, who
revised the legendary presidential slogan of Harry S. Truman to
criticize the ``do-nothing-for-people Congress.'' In particular,
Gore has called into question a Republican-backed version of
managed health care reform that would grant limited patient
protections, instead of guaranteeing an array of patient rights as
the Democratic proposal would.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see an opening in Gore's attack, however, and it is
this: They have actually advanced some narrow proposals of their
own, including the marriage and estate tax bills, both of which
enjoy broad support among the electorate as the economy continues
to flourish. Both are catchy-sounding and seem much simpler in
theory than accountants say they are in reality.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton vetos the bills in the days leading up to the
Republican convention that begins July 31 in Philadelphia,
Republicans ``will be able to show that it's not that they're not
doing anything,'' said Stephen Slivinski, a fiscal policy analyst
at the Cato Institute, a free-market oriented think tank in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say to their base, `We are doing something, it just
happens to be what we think is right, not what Gore thinks is
right,' '' Slivinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Slivinsky added, this week's legislative push
in Congress is a clever maneuver to revive the general debate over
taxes, which failed to generate much momentum during the primaries
or the early stages of the general election but is one of the few
areas in which Gore and Bush clearly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like everything now in the current lame-duck
administration, everything that goes on will be prime grist for the
debates in a couple of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can see is how Republicans respond to this
overwhelming surplus,'' Czwartacki, the Lott spokesman, said.
``This is something that, in the era of blurring lines, is very
distinctive between Democrats and Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, not surprisingly, see the legislative standoff
differently. Arguing that Republicans would jeopardize the federal
budget and the future of Social Security by slashing taxes too
dramatically, Democratic opponents of the pending tax bills have
used the votes to make a familiar political point: That the
Republican leadership in Congress is insensitive to the needs of
the lower and middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed estate tax repeal, Democrats argue, would affect
only a wealthy 2 percent of the American population. But that
aspect of the law is widely misunderstood by voters, who have
overwhelmingly approved eliminating the law in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about the priorities of Republicans that they are
out there trying to protect the interests of the very wealthiest
individuals in our society rather than trying to deal with the
hard-working Americans that are at the lower end of the economic
ladder?'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said Thursday in opposing the
estate tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who also opposed the bill, lodged a
formal complaint using a parliamentary procedure: He offered an
amendment to use $5 billion of the estate tax bill to help fund an
affordable-housing program. But the Kerry amendment was defeated,
and the Democratic protests were quickly overshadowed by Republican
claims of having overturned an unjust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people feel this is a fundamentally unfair tax,
whether it affects them or not,'' said Lott, a Mississippi
Republican. ``The idea that the federal government would reach into
the grave and pull back half a life's work offends people.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Majority leader Don Nickles told reporters Friday,``I
just urge the president to give the relief that's needed and let's
end this unfair, punitive tax on death.'' The Oklahoma Republican
added, ``So much energy is lost and expended trying to avoid this
very onerous, punitive tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill that passed the Senate Friday would phase out estate
taxes over the next decade, eliminating $104 billion in federal
revenues in the first 10 years and another $750 billion after that.
The House already passed a similar bill by an overwhelming margin,
with the help of Democratic support.

THE FORMER CAT STEVENS TELLS HIS SIDE OF THE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DeYOUNG   
 Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back home in London, Yusuf Islam on Friday reflected on his
detainment and expulsion from Israel this week, because of what
officials at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport would only tell him was
a matter of ``national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Islam, who gained fame in the 1970s as pop star Cat Stevens,
said it was only after he arrived in England that he read he had
been barred from the country for allegedly delivering money to the
radical Palestinian group Hamas during a visit in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Islam's name appeared on a list of people banned from Israel,
the Israeli daily Maariv reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knowingly gave any terrorist group money,'' Islam
said. ``I've given to poor people and hospitals. I've helped to buy
ambulances in the Holy Land. Obviously quite clear and supportable
aims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no affiliation with any organization such as Hamas,''
he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Islam's charitable organization, Mountain of Light, has donated
money and supplies to Israel, Bosnia and Macedonia. He has visited
children and other war victims.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, 51, said he had planned to visit Jerusalem with a crew
from the VH1 program ``Behind the Music,'' which is producing an
episode chonicling his pop career and subsequent conversion to the
Islamic faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were literally just going there for this filming,'' he
said. ``I thought everything was quite clear and understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to visit the Dome of the Rock, the beautiful
mosque in the center of Jerusalem, which was the first mosque I
ever walked into, as part of the story. I was going to be narrating
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``I was immediately separated from the crew
and questioned. Then I was told that I was going to be sent back to
Frankfurt on the next flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was led away to a very small cell with four other detainees.
Three were from Gaza, and another was an American who was coming
for a wedding. In a little room with no handle on it; it was a
locked door. With no water or other facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials denied mistreating the former singer, saying
he had been detained in the departure lounge.
</P>
<P>
   His 1988 visit, Islam said, was strictly a humanitarian mission.
``I had no intention, ever, to support terrorist groups, only to
look after the poor and needy who obviously need support in
difficult times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Money designated for Hamas-backed charities, the Israelis say,
often is diverted to the group's guerrilla wing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Islam was refused admission to Israel when he arrived
to attend a festival with his 5-year-old son. ``It was very sad
that my son had to bear that kind of experience,'' Islam said.
</P>
<P>
   Born Steve Deimitri Georgiou in West London, Islam changed his
name to Cat Stevens at the age of 17, and had sold millions of
records by 25. His best-known songs include ``Moonshadow,''
``Morning Has Broken,'' ``Peace Train'' and ``Wild World.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of spiritual journeys that turned into dead-ends, he
became a Muslim in 1977 and abandoned his music career. All of his
instruments and gold albums were auctioned for Islamic charities.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, he founded the Islamic Schools Trust, and today
he operates the Islamia primary and secondary schools in London. He
recently released a children's album featuring a recitation and
explanation of the Islamic alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Islam has been at the forefront of efforts by conservative
Muslims in Britain to pressure the government to fund separate
Islamic schools. He was thrust back into the international
headlines in 1989 when, during a speech at a British college he was
asked what he thought about Iran's death sentence against author
Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Islam's answer _ merely that the Koran supported capital
punishment for blasphemy, but that such action was unwise and
illegal in the modern world _ became a sensationalistic headline
around the world: Kill Rushdie, says Cat Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was misinterpreted and was never asked to set the
record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue was something people tried to connect me with, and
it had nothing to do with me,'' he said. ``But because I was a
famous name, I was being asked to comment on all sorts of crises
affecting the Muslim world. Which is not really fair, because I'm
not a scholar, and I shouldn't really be asked those kinds of
complex legal questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He fears this week's event will become yet another public
relations debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``With repeated attempts at maligning my integrity, and my good
intentions,'' he said, ``there's an objective to cast a dark shadow
_ more than a moonshadow _ on my life.''

TAKEOVER OF RELIANCE FALLS THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A planned takeover of Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings
collapsed Friday amid worries that Reliance might be unable to pay
debts that come due next month.
</P>
<P>
   Leucadia National, which had agreed in May to buy Reliance for
$295 million in stock, said it was unwilling to proceed with the
transaction, but left open the possibility that it might reach
another deal with the struggling insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The Leucadia deal had valued Reliance shares at $2.55 each, but
the stock has fallen well below that price as Reliance's financial
condition has continued to deteriorate. On Friday the shares fell
6.25 cents, to 50 cents. Reliance bonds that are due to mature in
November were quoted at 30 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance was the centerpiece of Steinberg's empire, which he
took over in a daring corporate raid in 1968 when he was 29 years
old. He used it in a failed attempt to take over Chemical Bank, a
New York giant, the next year, and in 1984 he made $60 million in a
failed effort to buy Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   As an insurance company, Reliance was moderately successful, but
it suffered major losses in workers compensation insurance in
recent years and began to decline.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, as insurance rating agencies cut Reliance's
rating to very low levels, Reliance has had to sell some
subsidiaries whose products, like insurance for corporate directors
and officers, can be sold only by companies with relatively high
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is in a fire sale right now,'' said Matthew Coyle,
a director of insurance ratings for Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``It has to
sell key businesses or lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the remaining insurance subsidiaries do not appear to be
in financial distress, most of the company's debt is at the
holding-company level, including nearly $240 million of bank debt
that matures in August and $290 million of bonds maturing in
November.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P cited ``increasing concerns that Reliance will fail in its
efforts to refinance'' those debts as it lowered its rating of the
company's bonds to CCC, the lowest rating the agency has for bonds
that are not in default. It also lowered its rating of the
insurance company's ability to pay to B, a weak level.
</P>
<P>
   Leucadia, whose shares rose 31.25 cents to $24.50 on Friday,
said it was continuing to talk to Reliance and would not say what
had led it to back away from the previously agreed transaction.
Along with property and casualty insurance, Leucadia has a wide
range of businesses and is known for snapping up undervalued
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg owned 29 million shares of Reliance at last report,
but most of them were pledged to secure debts from three financial
institutions, which are not fully covered at the stock's current
price. Some other shares have been sold to meet margin calls.
Reliance shares peaked at $19.8125 in the summer of 1998 and traded
above $6 as recently as February.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg has also sold other assets, including shares in other
companies and his Park Avenue apartment, which fetched over $30
million, and his antiques collection, which brought $12.5 million
in a Sotheby's auction in May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Steinberg got his start in 1961, when he was 22 and just out of
the University of Pennsylvania. He identified opportunities in
computer leasing, a business that was in its infancy. IBM, which
made the computers, was not interested in long-term leases, but
there was a demand for them. He started Leasco, which grew rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The company went public in 1965 and quickly became a hot stock,
as reported profits grew rapidly. There was criticism that the
profit growth reflected aggressive accounting, but the criticism
was largely ignored, and Leasco stock provided Steinberg with the
currency to take over Reliance, an old-line company that had assets
worth more than Wall Street realized.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Steinberg became known for a lavish lifestyle
and for an ability to sniff out value. The companies he raided were
often undervalued, but he generally was unable to make significant
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as an operating executive, he was less successful. He
took Reliance private in 1982, when stocks were cheap, and sold
shares in it to the public again in 1986. Those shares were issued
at $10 each, or about 20 times their current market price.

EX-PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR WORKING AT KENNEDY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND JONATHAN FRANKLIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Ecuadorean Supreme Court has issued warrants for
the arrest of Jamil Mahuad, who was deposed at the country's
president in January and has been teaching and working at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government since April.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad could not be reached Friday about charges that he
committed unconstitutional and corrupt acts during Ecuador's 1999
banking crisis. That crisis, and his decisions, were part of the
subject matter of a study group for undergraduates that Mahuad led
while a fellow at the school's Institute of Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Phillips, coordinator of the fellows program, said
Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from the
Kennedy school, taught during April under a special program ``for
distinguished politicians and professionals who can only come for a
short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were then made for him to stay on at the school
through the summer working on projects of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the study group, Mahuad ``talked about his experiences as
president of Ecuador,'' including his decisions to freeze thousands
of bank accounts and bail out 18 failed banks, said Phillips, who
attended some of the sessions. ``One of the great things about
having him here as a fellow was his willingness to talk about these
decisions and their repercussions. He is reflective and takes good
challenging questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ordering Mahuad's arrest, Galo Pico Mantilla,
head of Ecuador's supreme court, ordered electoral and
anti-corruption officials to provide details of contributions to
Mahuad's 1998 presidential campaign. According to El Comercio,
Ecuador's leading newspaper, the focus of interest is a $3 million
contribution from Fernando Aspiazu Seminario, former president of
Banco del Progresso.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts expect Pico to seek to have Mahuad extradited,
they said the effort is unlikely to succeed because of
international concerns about the inadequacy of procedural
guarantees in Ecuadorean law. Former vice president Alberto Dahik,
who is sought on corruption charges, has been granted political
asylum in Costa Rica, and former minister and presidential aspirant
Cesar Verduga received asylum in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad was president of Ecuador from August 1998 until he was
forced from office by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Former vice president Eduardo Pena Trivino, in a statement
Friday, said the arrest order was counterproductive because, he
said, Mahuad would never return while facing a jail sentence. If he
did not face arrest, the vice president said, Mahuad might have
returned to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of this being a triumph of justice, (the arrest order)
may well impede the truth from being found out,'' he said.
</P>

SOME DEMOCRATS UNEASY ABOUT GEPHARDT AS VP CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore met last Saturday with House
minority leader Richard Gephardt to discuss the possibility that
the Missourian could be Gore's running mate, but the prospect has
alarmed some Democrats who feared it would hurt their efforts to
retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt is a hero to many liberals and labor union leaders,
some of whom have been less than happy with Gore's support of
free-trade deals. But some Democrats said the selection of Gephardt
might harm efforts to win over independent swing voters who tend to
be more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Gephardt selection might complicate the party's
dream of retaking the House. Gephardt, as the top Democrat in the
House, would become speaker if Democrats win an additional six
seats and become the majority party. Last year, Gephardt met with a
dozen or so Democrats who were thinking about leaving the House and
said they had a duty to stay because a single race could determine
which party controls the House.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gephardt himself were to leave, Democratic control of his
own House seat would be in danger. Under an unusual Missouri law,
Gephardt would be barred from seeking reelection if he runs for the
vice presidency. His district is considered a tossup and a late
Democratic entrant might have trouble retaining the seat for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to happen,'' said Eric Smith,
Gephardt's former press secretary and now a spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Nonetheless, he added,
``I think he would be a great choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic source familiar with the meeting said Gore did not
ask Gephardt to be his running mate. The source said Gephardt
requested the meeting to tell Gore he did not want to be ``vetted''
in a full financial and personal investigation by the campaign. The
source said Gephardt told Gore he was very reluctant to even be
considered for the ticket, although Gephardt did not flatly say he
would refuse an offer. The Gephardt-Gore meeting was first reported
Friday on ABC News' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team, meanwhile, is continuing to investigate a
half-dozen potential candidates, including Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, whose status for weeks has been described by sources
as a backup who could get the nomination in case there are problems
with other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While the list of prospects shrinks and grows, various sources
said it also may include Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Senator
Richard Durbin of Illinois, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California,
former senators George Mitchell of Maine and Sam Nunn of Georgia,
and former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Kerry's strongest supporters say Gephardt would not
be Gore's top choice. Instead, they said his chances appear to
depend on whether others in the field falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that his stock is rising, it's whether the stock of
others is falling,'' said one Kerry associate who spoke on
condition of anonymity and has been actively promoting the senator.
Kerry, unlike Gephardt, has not met with Gore to discuss the vice
presidency, although he has met with Gore's associates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials stressed Friday that lists and rankings
of vice presidential candidates made recently in various media are
based only on speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt advocates said the congressman would be helpful to Gore
for several reasons: He would help win Missouri and possibly other
Midwest states; he would be popular with union organizations that
are upset with Gore's support of free-trade deals; and he might
help retain liberal voters who otherwise would be attracted to
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   But Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy
Institute, the moderate Democratic think tank, said: ``Dick
Gephardt obviously is a political heavyweight, but I'm not sure
putting him on the ticket would help Al Gore with the central
challenge of this campaign, which is winning independents who are
going to determine this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he doesn't have such concerns about prospects such
as Kerry or Graham, calling them ``New Democrats.''

   GERGIEV-BALLET (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Every year, around the
summer solstice, this faded imperial city steps back into the
limelight. On those long white nights, when the sun dips out of
sight for only a few hours, crowds gather on the banks of the Neva
River, even shabby hotels fill up with tourists and at the
venerable Maryinsky (formerly Kirov) Theater, the seats at the
``Stars of the White nights'' festival are taken up by rich patrons
from all over the world. This is also the one time when Valeri
Gergiev, one of the world's most sought after conductors who also
happens to be theater's artistic director, bring a his star quality
home to this gritty city with a pretty face. By Celestine Bohlen.

   BOLSHOI-BALLET (New York) _ Power and passion: The Bolshoi
Ballet's dancing has been synonymous with these qualities, making
it a company unlike any other. Virtually sold out for its
appearances at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 this week, as was its
recent five-city U.S. tour, the fabled company from Moscow returns
to New York for the first time in 10 years, and with its potent
mystique intact. Nonetheless, as Aleksei Fadeyechev says, ``It is a
different company now. Time chooses dancers for its own time.''
Fadeyechev, who was one of the company's stars and Nina
Ananiashvili's partner here in 1990, was named the ballet troupe's
artistic director in 1998 under Vladimir Vasiliev, the superstar
who was given the new and double post of general and artistic
director of the entire Bolshoi Theater in 1995. By Anna Kisselgoff.

   CHUCK&AMP;BUCK-FILM (Undated) _ Insinuating its way into a summer of
movies of negligible ambiguity comes one of the major chew bones of
this year's Sundance Film Festival, ``Chuck and Buck.'' The movie,
scheduled to open July 14, is about boyhood friends who
re-encounter one another after many years. It's a movie that
careens into one cringe-inducing circumstance after another: the
sexuality of children, the old relationship that will not die, the
overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the panicked, the
geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy! By Jamie Malanowski.

   COMMIE-COMEDY-FILM (Undated) _ The phrase ``Communist musical
comedy'' may sound like an oxymoron, but even the officially
achieved utopia of no-longer-extant East Germany required a few
measures of utopian song-and-dance. ``Hot Summer,'' the teen-age
musical that was the DDR's second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is
not quite socialism a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact

   ZAKS-THEATER (New York) _ Sitting in the cool darkness of the
theater balcony where ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' was about to
start previews, Jerry Zaks did not come across as a burdened man.
Yet if his experiences of the last few years have not succeeded in
darkening the Broadway director, they have certainly left him more
defended. And no wonder. Zaks, 53, is coming off a bad run of
flops, including last season's ``Epic Proportions'' and the 1999
``Civil War.'' But one could also argue that Zaks has not so much

composer. He will, in his words, ``recount what can be reliably
documented and examine some of the persistent images.'' Knowing the
chronologies and the anecdotes from friends is a help, but they do
not tell us who Schubert was. Indeed, the truth of Schubert is that
he knows more about us than we about him. Some creative people are

Scouts, religion, lynching, college cheerleading, pollution,
plagiarism, prudishness. They are twisted, erudite parodies of the
perverse. So it comes as a bit of a surprise on meeting Tom Lehrer,
the Harvard-trained mathematician-cum-musician that the disc jockey
Barry Hansen has called ``the most brilliant song satirist ever
recorded,'' to learn that he seems a lot more like the gently
whimsical voice behind his children's songs for the television
series ``The Electric Company,'' than the sick-genius author of
``Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.'' By Todd S. Purdum.

   INTERNET-SWEENEY-TODD (Undated) _ There are nights in the
theater, the opera house, the symphony hall that earn the
designation legendary. We've all heard about them, or perhaps, with
luck, even caught a few. And that, of course, is the point. Beyond
their momentary transcendence, legendary nights linger largely
because of their evanescence. What becomes a legend most is the
very fact that you had to be there. But what about the Internet?

   MAURY-TV (Undated) _ ``Entertainment Weekly,'' this season's
``biggest success story'' in syndicated daytime television. The
ratings are up some 19 percent since last year, and it now
occasionally outpoints the popular ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' in the
same time slot here in New York. This ``daytime yakker'' has got

   PULITZER-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ Now for the bad news: good
news is on vacation. Permanently. In the news media, anyway, ``no
news is good news'' just might be read as ``there is no such thing
as good news,'' something local television has been trying to
convince viewers of for years. That goes double for news
photography: the news photographs you remember are likely to
compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the streets of
Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body through
the streets of Somalia. Pictures of those three events won Pulitzer
Prizes. A show called ``The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the
Moment,'' at the Newseum/NY in midtown Manhattan through Sept. 23,
reinforces the widespread impression that news tends to be violent
and morbid. By Vicki Goldberg.

   HEJDUK-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Though John Hejduk was little
known outside the world of architecture, his influence exceeded
that of many of its most prominent figures. His death last week, at
71, leaves a profound emptiness _ a quality that, as it happens,
Hejduk often reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects,
he was a contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work
in a highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of
living out the contradiction. By Herbert Muschamp.

   CYRUS-MEHRI-PROFILE (Undated) _ For Cyrus Mehri, challenging the
status quo is second nature. His Iranian mother was punished as a
university student for criticizing the shah. Asked to do a book
report in the seventh grade, he chose one of Abbie Hoffman's. He
cut his political teeth with Ralph Nader, organizing communities to
rise up around issues like the Superfund cleanups and telephone
rates, and even his birthday, July 14, coincides with a
revolutionary milestone, at least for the French. So when he filed
a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Co., representing four
current and former black employees who said they had been denied
raises, promotions and other advancement because of their race, it
was a fairly typical move for Mehri. By Constance L. Hays.

   PARIS-FASHIONS (Paris) _ It is, to begin with, a perverse world.
Only 1,000, maybe 1,500 women are rich enough, spoiled enough and
otherwise bored enough to buy haute couture clothes. And if they
are very rich, they don't even bother coming here at all. They send
their private planes to have the fitters from the big houses
brought to them. You can imagine what this adds to the price of a
$50,000 dress trembling with illusion pearls. But it is a very
specific world nonetheless, its influence and entertainment value
extending far beyond the thin women who sit shank to shank along

   RUSSIA-RAVE (St. Petersburg) _ From afar, lasers and strobe
lights could be seen bursting mutely from within the island fort,
as if it were being consumed by some mysterious battle,
transforming it into a radiant beacon amid the 3 a.m. twilight
covering the Gulf of Finland. But as the ferryboat loaded with
young people docked after its three-hour voyage, music pulsating
from the turreted fort broke the stillness. On the first weekend of
July, as many as 10,000 Russian youth laid siege to an abandoned
and crumbling Czarist structure some 30 miles off the coast of St.
Petersburg for dancing, performance art and general merriment
during the season of northern Russia's White Nights, when the sun

</P>
<P>
   STOCK-HOLDINGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ It's the new risk for the
politician in this new economy: Lawmakers who actively invest are
discovering that their stock portfolios have become yet another
area of their personal lives that is vulnerable to attack. By Don
Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTES-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Where Have All the Footnotes
Gone?'' the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay. At
that point, footnotes lucky enough to survive at all had moved to
the backs of books and turned into less scrutinized end notes.
Annotation was out; breezy, uninterrupted prose was in. Indeed the
Web has not only revived the footnote, it has spawned a
cross-referencing craze that renders the formerly complete media
event into a reference-laden, link-dependent, list-spewing
wallflower waiting to be courted by the next available annotator.
By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   WEBSITE-BOOK-REVIEWERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Book critics can be a
pompous, self-important lot. Many people gripe that they are out of
touch with the common reader and that their highfalutin academic
tastes have no relation to what the masses might enjoy. As with
every other aspect of modern life, the Internet _ specifically
Amazon.com _ has leveled the literary playing field. The Web site's
customers can review books and post their critiques, and thousands
of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated them to the
digital universe. By John D. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   QUANTUM-PHYSICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Startling as life in the
subatomic realm can seem, with particles existing both here and
there or darting to and fro at the same time, people have been able
to take some small comfort in knowing that the ``real'' world
doesn't work that way. Though made of the very same stuff that
marches to the dictates of quantum theory _ the laws that explain
how particles behave _ solid objects obediently occupy one place at
a time and are never seen moving in two directions at once. But
when quantum rules are applied to the domain of creatures and
things, the result is nonsense. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ESTATE-TAX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The belief that anyone can grow
rich in America took root even before the colonies decided to
become a nation. This faith has outlasted innumerable depressions,
recessions, inflations and deflations, and today, with millionaires
now making up less than 4 percent of the population, it seems
stronger than ever. It's wise to keep this fiscal theology in mind
when trying to understand the push congressional Republicans are
making to repeal the estate tax _ and the unexpectedly wide support
they've garnered, both in Congress and among many Americans. By
Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-THESIS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ah, the lessons learned in youth.
About love, faith, family and yes, the power of television to
define the modern presidency. This last issue weighed especially
heavily on at least one young person, Albert Gore Jr., as revealed
in the topic he chose for his senior thesis for the history
department at Harvard in 1969. Its title: ``The Impact of
Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947-1969.'' The
84-page paper sheds light on an aspect of political life that would
preoccupy Gore in his own career in public office and into the
current presidential campaign. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ There is a dirty little
secret in American arms control circles these days: No one really
knows where U.S. nuclear doctrine is headed. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-REFORM-FCC (Washington) _ In 1998, the Federal
Communications Commission announced that it was going to consider
setting up hundreds of low-power radio stations for non-profit
organizations across the country. In January of this year, William
Kennard, the commission's chairman, said he would proceed with the
plan and that the groups could begin applying for 1,000 licenses.
It was potentially the biggest change in the radio industry since
the growth of FM in the 1960s, analysts said, and it has become one
of the most controversial issues in Washington. By David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ News highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ULSTER-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ It can be useful for
Israelis and Palestinians to look closely at Northern Ireland for
instructive parallels, warnings signs, and, more recently,
practical lessons in conflict resolution. Not all the lessons are
encouraging. By William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC-REVIEW (Undated) _ They mislead each other, although they
are supposedly on the same side. They make decisions that shape the
economies of the world based on disturbingly imperfect information.
If they were a U.S. conglomerate, they would be market pariahs and
serious candidates for Chapter 11. The subject under discussion is
not a failing Eastern European car manufacturer, but the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, the
fractious group that controls the global supply of crude oil, the
commodity that runs the world. By Neela Bannerjee.

(For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is July 4 in London, around 7 p.m., and Helen Sinclair,
director of a British venture capital fund called Matrix Private
Equity, is surveying the buzzing bar from a corner of the room
where, at least for the moment, she can relax. ``As a red dot, I
get swamped,'' Sinclair says, looking somewhat exhausted. ``I meet
green dots for only three minutes each and can usually get in
around 40 green dots in an evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair is referring to a surreal new social order that springs
up in more than 80 cities around the world on the first Tuesday of
every month. In fashionable watering holes, entrepreneurs
identified by the green dots on their name tags seek out investors,
identified by red dots, while a third subculture, identified by
yellow dots, simply hobnobs, in case its members ever want to
become red or green dots.
</P>
<P>
   What began as an informal networking party on Oct. 2, 1998, at
the Alphabet bar in London's Soho for 80 people working in the new
economy has grown into something of a worldwide phenomenon. A bevy
of imitators have sprung up, too. And those who created the first
gathering in London have incorporated as a start-up business called
First Tuesday, which a company founder, Julie Meyer, acknowledges
is a bit of a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an accidental company,'' she said. ``It was totally the
right place at the right time.'' Nonetheless, she is intent on
expanding the concept around the globe to ``democratize the process
of getting venture capital.''
</P>
<P>
   With one small catch. Eyeing the more than $100 million its
gatherings have helped entrepreneurs raise, First Tuesday plans to
make money by taking a cut of the deals that emerge from its
events.
</P>
<P>
   As dot-com mania expands far beyond its Silicon Valley origins,
entrepreneurs and investors worldwide face many issues _ some
global and some distinctly domestic. Money &AMP; Business sent
reporters to First Tuesday gatherings in seven cities this month to
see what was on the minds and the lips of members of the dot-com
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City: An Election Victory Is Good for Business
</P>
<P>
   Mexican society has been buzzing with excitement since Vicente
Fox Quesada, the former Coca-Cola executive, booted the world's
longest-ruling political party out of office on July 2, and nowhere
was that feeling more pronounced than at the euphoric First Tuesday
gathering in Mexico City. Members of the dot-com generation here,
which is largely responsible for sweeping Fox into power, could
barely contain their excitement about the new economy's newfound
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the next president of Mexico worked for
Coca-Cola means he really understands business,'' said Francisco de
Dios, chief executive of iBest Mexico, an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   And in the opinion of many of the dot-com players that crowded
into the Hacienda de los Morales, a lavish 17th-century farmhouse
that is now a restaurant, Fox is exactly what the new economy
needs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Fox's victory that is inspiring them. They
see the Mexican market as a field of opportunity anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has enormous growth potential, even more so now that
democracy has arrived,'' de Dios said. ``We're still in diapers in
this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people here say legal reforms are essential for that
potential to be realized. For example, although the Mexican
Congress took an important step forward two months ago by
recognizing the validity of electronic documents, some grumbled
over legislators' decision to stop short of legitimizing electronic
signatures. Another legal constraint, according to Tony Rayo, chief
executive of Grey Interactive Mexico, an affiliate of the big
advertising company, is that Mexican law requires companies to be
profitable for several years before they can file for initial
public offerings, forcing start-up companies to look for financing
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Rosengaus, chief executive of NCubo, which offers
investment capital and technical expertise for Internet start-ups,
said that more flexible regulations are needed to open the stock
market to start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican start-ups, Rosengaus added, suffer from the lack of a
venture-capital mentality here. ``If we get better access to
capital, there will be a greater development of concepts in the
country,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   London: Where Options Are No Advantage
</P>
<P>
   Talking about money has always been considered crass in Britain.
So three floors full of 500 people not only talking about money,
but asking for it, pleading for it and in at least one case begging
for it, might normally be considered downright gauche.
</P>
<P>
   But not tonight. ``If you put all these people in a pub, they
would never talk to each other,'' said Mike Boston, head of
executive search at Citadel, a British recruitment company, who
came armed with a box of business cards. ``This event breaks down
that British reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston asserted that Britain was going through a fundamental
shift in culture, driven by the new economy. In London, American
business values and a combination of cultures from around the world
have steadily infiltrated the traditionally staid British mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Stratford, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, is prowling for
start-up financing. He needs about $750,000 for what he will
describe only as a transport business. ``You could easily bum the
idea,'' he said. His name tag, which identified him as being from a
company called Equido.com, bore an Internet address he had not even
bought yet. He does not have a business plan, either.
</P>
<P>
   While green dots clearly outnumbered the red dots, the money
still seems to be pouring in here. Andrea Marshall, an American
working in London as a consultant for Roland Berger &AMP; Partners,
said she used to believe that Britain's new economy lagged behind
that of the United States by two years. But she recently revised
her opinion. ``The stereotype that the Europeans are less
entrepreneurial is no longer true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that continues to annoy people in the high-technology
industry is Britain's tax treatment of employee stock options. In
contrast to practice in the United States, employees must pay
capital gains tax on stock options in Britain, making the incentive
less attractive than a substantial salary. That puts pressure on
companies to find loopholes and other ways to compensate employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so bloody complicated that you spend hundreds of
thousands of pounds and lots of management time trying to find
work-arounds,'' said Azzeem Azhar, chief executive of Esouk, an
incubator company.

   ATLANTA _ Hot and dry. It's been that kind of summer.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for many families in metro Atlanta, those long-awaited
vacations have been taken and cabin fever is setting in as everyone
waits for the first days of school and, a bit later, the first
cooling breezes of early fall.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much that can be done about the weather, but we've
been talking among ourselves and with metro Atlantans and have
devised a battle plan _ a spiritual battle plan _ to handle the
last few weeks of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of things to do _ books to read, music to listen
to, movies to watch, retreat centers to attend _ that might make
the coming weeks more enjoyable and meaningful.

<P>
   Among the most overtly ``religious'' material these days are two
series of novels with very different tones and messages, but with
equally enthusiastic audiences: the apocalyptic fiction of Jerry B.
Jenkins and Tim LaHaye in the ``Left Behind'' books, and the
everyday adventures of the inhabitants of the mountain village of
Mitford in the works of North Carolina novelist Jan Karon.
</P>
<P>
   For the theologically inclined, there are biblical explorations
such as ``Stories Between the Testaments'' by Atlanta author

study of the people of the books called the Apocrypha by
Protestants and the Deuterocanon by Catholics.

   Moscow: Plenty of Scientists, But Few Managers
</P>
<P>
   In the dimly lit Planet Hollywood in central Moscow,
entrepreneurs are fishing for financing. Some carry business plans
scrawled on single sheets of paper; others speak of offices in
Siberia. A banker chatted under a fake palm tree with the head of
Russia's biggest Internet portal, Port.ru.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's online market is tiny. In a population of 147 million,
only about two million people use the Internet. Advertising last
year barely topped $2 million, but that seemed to indicate all the
more potential for a country dominated by scientists and engineers.
``This place is a gold mine of sophisticated ideas,'' said Igor
Kocmanek, president of iXcelerator.com, whose assets include a
software company.
</P>
<P>
   When First Tuesdays began here last October, a group of about 40
curious industry insiders took part. That number has swelled to
more than 300, and investors sometimes outnumber project
developers. ``It's pure business,'' said Kocmanek, a Czech citizen
who formerly worked at an investment bank here. ``When we started
in October, there was no money in the Russian Internet. Then in the
winter, it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, there has been about $15 million in commerce involving
what locals call RuNet _ the Russian Internet _ according to Ron
Lewin, chairman of the Internet technology committee at the
American Chamber of Commerce here.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem in Russia is finding good managers. The
Soviet Union produced generations of talented scientists and
engineers, people in the business community say, but it crushed
entrepreneurial instincts. People with ideas lack marketing skills.
Business plans are rough road maps, hastily drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good CFO's are few and far between,'' said Brian Wardrop, who
helps manage an $80 million high-technology fund in central Europe.
``A lot of times, we'll pass on a deal because we don't believe the
company will actually produce monthly reports. Responsiveness is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet niches abound in Russia's nascent market _ and the design of
programs for export is one of them. Russian companies exported an
estimated $1.5 million in programs last year, dwarfed by, say,
India's $6.5 billion. Russians have a reputation as superb
programmers, but the country's main business hurdle is selling the
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Some projects defy the imagination. As Igor Vasiliades, a first
vice president at Sibintek, an Internet subsidiary of Yukos Oil,
Russia's second-biggest oil company, tells it, his company is
trying to exploit that niche. So Sibintek retrained 1,100
unemployed oil-town workers in four Russian cities and put them to
work in computer programming labs. Eventually, Sibintek plans to
have 2,000 retrained employees writing programs for foreign
clients. ``We want big factories that can fill any order quickly
and cheaply,'' Vasiliades said. ``Labor in the regions is a fifth
of what it costs in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other projects bring the market to Internet users. Brian
Flygare, sales director at a small marketing service provider,
Direct Star, said his site had struck a note with small businesses
that lack the time or the money to develop online sales. Flygare
sends troops of college students out to retailers, like the shops
in the famed GUM department store on Red Square, to persuade them
to post coupons on the site offering discounts to customers. Direct
Star gets a small fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of retailers out there who are terrified _
they hear `Internet' and they don't understand it,'' Flygare said.
``This is a way to wet their feet.''

   Madrid: How to Play a Game Of Internet Catch-Up
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath a glass case holding an elaborate black mask
from the movie ``Zorro,'' Bruno Mazzilli is checking out the action
in Planet Hollywood. But it is not the svelte young women
circulating around the oblong bar that interest him _ unless they
are wearing green dots.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzilli works for Unin Fenosa, a Spanish utility that has
bought big stakes in telecommunications operators and is now
looking to do the same in Internet start-ups. It is the old economy
seeking opportunities in the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already invested in two Internet companies and want to
invest in more because it's definitely the future, but things
aren't moving as fast here in the sector as they were six months
ago,'' complained Mazzilli, 28, a corporate development executive.
Behind the slowdown is nervousness from the sharp downturn in
American technology stocks States during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet sector in Spain still lags behind other
countries, he added. According to industry analysts, just over 11
percent of Spaniards use the Internet regularly, much lower than
the percentages in the United States or some other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Others who gathered here expressed similar concerns: timidity
among potential investors and Spain's need to catch up with the
remainder of the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's less euphoria,'' said Jaime Ventura, 24, managing
director of Universidadweb.com, a Web site aimed at Spanish
university students. ``But there is still incredible potential for
growth in Spain, because the Internet is so underdeveloped in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   People here, ranging from older executives in business suits to
those barely out of their teens and in sandals and T-shirts, said
Spaniards would gladly surf the Web for information, but were
reluctant to use it to buy goods, mainly because they are not
comfortable sending their credit card numbers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is afraid of fraud,'' explained Cesar Canas, 28, who
is trying to drum up business for Construdia, a company that he and
two partners started last year to provide business-to-business
services for small to midsize construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some confidence that people will get used to the
Internet. ``The government is taking an active role in the sector
and telling everyone that the new technology and the Internet are
the future,'' Caas said. ``I hope it comes soon, because our
company is operating now for seven months and we're still looking
for customers.''

   Prague: Bells Are Ringing For `M-Commerce'
</P>
<P>
   In a polo shirt and jeans, Richard Seewald, a lawyer, stands on
the terrace of the Fromin discotheque overlooking the church spires
of Prague, scouting for places to invest $50 million for his
Internet venture capital fund, Redstars.com.
</P>
<P>
   He sees potential pots of gold here. The Czech economy has begun
to stabilize after two years of recession, and prospects look good
for Internet business, particularly in ``m-commerce,'' the new tag
for buying and selling over the mobile telephones that are
ubiquitous in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet here has taken off in the past six to eight
months, so there is a need for what we do,'' Seewald said. ``The
buzz up to now has been ex-pat companies; now we are getting more
and more local business plans'' _ not just those of Americans with
an idea that was too late for Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is totally the buzz,'' agreed Adam Healey, a 25-year
old New Yorker, as the constant ringing of mobile phones filled the
room. Healey's Samba Digital Media, an Internet services company
based in Prague, just pulled in $2.5 million of venture capital.
Healey had just finished briefing 200-odd entrepreneurs who filled
the disco. ``Ask yourself which investor you can hang out and have
a beer with,'' he said. ``You're going to be spending a lot of time
with them, so you'd better like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Healey's company produces Web pages and e-commerce solutions for
companies around the world. Like many local ventures, he combined
the entrepreneurial skills of the young Americans who have flocked
to Prague with the technical knowledge of Czech software engineers.
Now he is moving a step further _ to m-commerce _ and he has come
to First Tuesday to spread the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Czechs have one of the highest penetrations of mobile
phones in the world,'' he said. ``It's a lot easier for someone to
buy a mobile than a PC.'' And because of the lack of credit card
use and consumer credit, the firms that operate digital mobile
phone networks take the credit risk. With only about 6 percent of
Czechs having regular Internet access at their homes or offices,
m-commerce is likely to outstrip the PC-based internet for most
consumer use.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Krasnan, 21, a student at the prestigious Prague School of
Economics, also has big plans. He doesn't have a business card yet;
his nameplate has just an e-mail address. With fellow students, he
is perfecting a secret mobile phone application as part of a
national student contest to join an Internet incubator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas I have, but I am keeping them for myself,'' Krasnan
said. ``Of course we want to be rich, but we really want to create
something that isn't here. We want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Vedej will settle for changing the way that Czechs think
about the Internet. ``Companies here are still investing in
traditional marketing tools such as printed stuff,'' complained
Vedej, 25, managing director of Frontline Management, another
e-solution provider for the Czech market. ``They don't appreciate
the potential of the Internet. They are just waiting.'' The first
time Vedej came to a First Tuesday, earlier this year, he didn't
even know what venture capital was. Now he has a business plan and
is looking for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Karel Kosman, another red-dot wearer, fears that Prague's
Internet boom may have gathered speed too quickly. ``The situation
is a little like the Wild West here. People are snapping up any
deals at all. It's not healthy. People are going to lose money.''

<P>
   Singapore: A Caution Signal In Venture Capital
</P>
<P>
   The spring rout on the Nasdaq caught Southeast Asia's dot-com
industry in an awkward adolescent stage, somewhere between finding
venture capital and a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Bar, a minimalist hang-out where 20- and 30-somethings
come after work, business cards are flying like chips in a casino.
But consultants outnumber venture capitalists, who in turn
outnumber the people with the ideas worth financing.
</P>
<P>
   Caution is the watchword, and one good indication is Chia Tek
Yew's appointment book. Chia, chief executive of
PricewaterhouseCoopers' Venture Accelerator, specializes in
investing in high-technology start-ups. But these days, he said,
venture capitalists are hiring his group to scrutinize the business
plans of companies in which they want to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want someone to rubber-stamp them,'' said Chia, as he
described how early hopes for easy riches had given way to
questions about which businesses would prosper and which would die.
``The idea of spending someone else's money is gone,'' he said,
adding that his own firm now insists on being a co-signer of its
start-ups' checks.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a way, brings the region full circle. At this time last
year, aspiring entrepreneurs were rare and venture capitalists
willing to finance them even rarer. But government incentives and
success stories from the United States changed all that, giving
rise to what some say has been a gold rush of dot-com financing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Southeast Asia presents its own disadvantages to potential
investors. Political instability and civil strife around the region
have scared off foreign investors to larger markets with more
obvious Internet plays. So despite efforts to set up Southeast
Asian versions of Nasdaq with easier listing requirements for
high-tech start-ups, the prospects for a wildly received initial
public offering are dimmer than before.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Southeast Asia as a market for online services is
looking less lucrative. Only a tiny minority of the region's
residents use the Internet so far, and they are spread across vast
regions separated by language, culture and regulatory barriers. ``I
won't look at a plan that says the company is looking at only one
country or just Southeast Asia,'' Chia said.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh on many minds here are the travails of a local start-up
called Catcha.com. Designed as a Yahoo-style search engine tailored
for Southeast Asian Web surfers, the company is cutting staff after
postponing plans to raise 55 million Singapore dollars ($31.5
million) in an initial public offering in May. Its 25-year-old
founder has offered to work for free.

   New York: A Little Optimism At the Fashion Show
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers love a party they can't get invited to. Or so you
would guess watching the long line outside Ohm, a discotheque on
West 22nd Street in Manhattan. There, 600 fashionable men and
women, whittled from a list of 1,400 who wanted to attend, sipped
flavored martinis and angled for face time before a roving news
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the technology stock meltdown in April, new-economy
soirees still attract a lot of media. There were so many reporters
there it was nearly impossible to miss them, or the legions of
entrepreneurs trying to woo them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad time for a lot of people,'' said Michael
Petersohn, the vice president for sales at Clickfinger.com, a
yet-to-be launched Web site that helps users bookmark their
favorite sites. ``But things are getting better.'' Clickfinger
started developing its site three months before the technology
plunge and has had trouble attracting money. But in recent days,
potential investors have been more willing to listen to
Clickfinger's pitch, though the commitments are slow in coming.
``Individuals are saying, `we didn't lose our Hamptons house,' so
they are more open,'' he said. ``But it's still hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just for Web builders. Near the front bar, Etyan
Bar-Chama, 30, a partner at Carpediem Technology Ventures, said
investors have balked on the millions of dollars they first
promised, leaving the five-month-old fund with only $5 million.
``They are taking down their investments,'' he said. ``We see more
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, he said, are becoming more selective about what
venture capitalists they want to give money to. One way his firm is
addressing that is by bringing in other, more established venture
capitalists to lead a deal. The fledgling fund has been trying to
forge strategic alliances with established corporations that have a
history of acquiring venture-backed concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, as the First Tuesday festivities drew to a close,
that the Internet party that attracted khaki-clad Jeff Bezos clones
and sleek women in Manola Blahnik heels was, in a larger sense,
past its prime.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Price, vice president of business development for the Web
site USLaw.com, said he used to go to ``three or four parties a
night and walk away with martini glasses and stuff like that.'' But
those days are gone. ``Now you have the concept of profitability
and people are looking at the cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That did not dampen the spirits of Walter Joyce, vice president
for strategic planning at Inculab, a Manhattan-based incubator for
Internet ideas. ``I came to try and gauge the pulse,'' he said.
``I'm still optimistic.''

`WHO KILLED ATLANTA'S CHILDREN?': HAMPERED BY A PLODDING, SKETCHY
SCREENPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By DAVID DeWITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One at a time they cascade across the screen, face after face,
lives cut short and deaths not explained.
</P>
<P>
   Set against a dark background and accompanied by haunting gospel
music, the opening moments of ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?''
suggest a film that will have a focused appeal and a subtle
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's good intentions, however, are undercut by the bulk
of this fact-based drama, which compresses a painful, complex tale
into a plodding, sketchy screenplay that, sadly, is not enlivened
by either direction or performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' _ on Showtime Sunday at 8
p.m. _ is based on a 1986 investigation by Spin magazine, which
reported on the doubts that remained in the wake of a frightening
series of murders in Atlanta between 1979 and 1981. Known as ``the
Atlanta child murders,'' the case was declared closed after the
1982 conviction of Wayne Williams, who was a suspect in the
murders, for killing two of the victims, who at 21 and 27 were
adult men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' covers explosive territory.
The case prompted fear in the Georgia capital and across the
nation, because of the victims' youth, because of their numbers
(the official total was 29) and because of their race: All were
black.
</P>
<P>
   As depicted in the film, mothers of some slain children remain
unconvinced that Williams, who is black, was responsible for all
the deaths. Ron Larson (Gregory Hines) and Pat Laughlin (James
Belushi) are the journalists who step in to help their cause. They
find evidence of a confused investigation and desperate
investigators. An insider source (played with crusty authenticity
by Sean McCann) points the reporters to suspects allied to racist
groups. Worse, the source offers documentation of an inquiry into
those suspects, one not made public because, the film suggests, the
authorities were more concerned about smoothing racial tensions
than about solving crimes.
</P>
<P>
   That secret investigation and its disturbing context were the
crux of Spin's report. The film, written and directed by Charles
Robert Carner, has an even broader reach. One short but evocative
scene is dominated by a portrait of President Reagan, with a man in
the foreground giving telephone assurance to an unidentified
someone that the authorities had settled the Atlanta child murders.
</P>
<P>
   Such conspiracy material, coupled with the families' grief and
desire for closure, offers plenty to occupy ``Who Killed Atlanta's
Children?'' So it is disappointing that the film wastes most of its
energy on the journalists' professional issues and domestic
worries. Imagine ``All the President's Men''; make the
investigative focus more somber and grisly; now envision Woodward
and Bernstein talking about their childhoods, or swapping advice on
balancing family and work. The mix makes an unwieldy whole.
</P>
<P>
   Hines gives Larson a nicely reticent dignity, but he can't lift
dialogue that locks his character, an editor, into obvious
professional conflicts with the freewheeling writer played by
Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   Also conventional is the revelation that Larson feels distant
from his lower-income relatives as well as from his less
sophisticated Southern sources. (The film's portrait of Atlanta is
visually and socially unappealing.)
</P>
<P>
   Belushi as Laughlin is saddled with even more generic material.
``Everyone wants to blame others for their own failures,'' Laughlin
says of the Atlanta murders, a provocative attitude that is diluted
because it is used to reveal the reporter's boyhood more than it is
to enrich his current situation. Belushi's few muted moments add
more to the film than his typical bluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' does not try to answer its
titular question. The movie does not exonerate Williams (given a
creepy edge by Cle Bennett). And it makes no declaration of blame,
though it examines possibilities of several killers tied to several
motives: urban prostitution, political hypocrisy and organized
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the movie calls attention to a set of killings that
were never given as fair and thorough a hearing as they deserved.
The streamlined tale of ``Who Killed Atlanta's Children?'' proves
no more satisfying a hearing.

EU APPOINTS PANEL TO REVIEW AUSTRIA FOR POSSIBLE END OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing) (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<P>
   PARIS _ Five months after the European Union imposed sanctions
on Austria to protest the inclusion of members of a far-right party
in the Austrian government, machinery giving everyone a face-saving
way to end the diplomatic freeze is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts has been named to study Austria's human
rights record and the political nature of Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party. Once that is done, the sanctions are to be reviewed,
and _ if the panel finds Austria does not violate civil rights _
presumably lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Austria says it wants the sanctions off by October, when all 15
European Union leaders hold a summit meeting in France, although
France, the leader in imposing the diplomatic freeze on Austria,
still refuses to promise anything.
</P>
<P>
   But already there are signs of a thaw. At Bastille Day
celebrations Friday, Austria's ambassador was among the dignitaries
sharing the reviewing stand with President Jacques Chirac, a far
cry from the twists and turns that have gone on to keep Chirac out
of range of Austrian officials in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there are enormous pressures at work that are
likely to make the sanctions disappear fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, France has just taken over the rotating six-month
presidency of the European Union and both its prestige and perhaps
the timely expansion of the union are riding on its being able to
deliver on a difficult agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen countries on the runway to join the
union, the EU must overhaul its institutions or face paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for instance, most EU decisions require a unanimous
vote. That is hard enough with 15 members, but experts say it would
be virtually impossible to get anything done if there were more
members.
</P>
<P>
   With an issue like this to broker, many experts say, the tension
created by continued sanctions could be a disaster. Earlier this
month, Austrian officials threatened to use their veto to block any
sort of progress. This week, they seemed to back down, perhaps
judging how unpopular such a stand would make them. But analysts
say a failure to resolve the problem could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was French I would be worried,'' said Charles Grant, a
political analyst with the Center for European Reform in London.
``These issues are always brokered as a package. You don't want one
country that is not really trying to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the sanctions remain unanimously in force with
14 members refusing to meet Austrian officials at anything more
than a ``technical level,'' many European Union countries have
indicated that they would like to see the situation resolved.
Currently, France, Belgium and Holland are considered to be the
only hold outs calling for the sanctions to continue.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some smaller ``euroskeptic'' countries, the freeze has been
seen as an example of big countries going after small ones for
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the fact that Italy has had far-right
politicians in its government but no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   And many point out that Chirac's enthusiastic denunciations of
Austria's Freedom Party play well at home, where Chirac is already
trying to position himself for the 2002 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   That argument is having a particular impact in Denmark, which is
considering whether or not to adopt the euro as its currency. A
referendum on the issue is to be held this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boycott could cost the vote in Denmark,'' said Grant.
``The truth is that this freeze was entered into on the spur of the
moment, and nobody thought about the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   These ripple effects are also putting pressure on France to
stand down.
</P>
<P>
   This week certainly seemed to show a softening all around.
First, Chirac invited the Austrian ambassador to the Bastille Day
celebrations. Then, the Belgians announced that they, too, would
extend a similar courtesy and invite the Austrian ambassador to
their national day celebrations July 21.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chancellor Wofgang Schuessel of Austria seemed to
be suddenly toning down his comments this week, and some analysts
suggested he already had the air of a man who had won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Brussels on Wednesday, he assured everyone that his
country would do nothing to sabotage the EU preparations for an
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words such as `threats,' `blackmail' and `veto' should be
deleted from the vocabulary,'' Schuessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel also embraced the choice of three ``wise men'' to
examine Austria's human rights record _ Martti Ahtisaari, the
former president of Finland; Jochen Frowein, director of the
Max-Plank Institute in Germany; and Marcelino Oreja, a former
Spanish minister and past member of the European Commission _ and
said they would have little problem reviewing Austrian ``commitment
to common European values.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts warned that Austria is not out of the
doghouse yet and could jeopardize the lifting of the sanctions if
it is not careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that everyone is getting ready for the
climbdown,'' said Peter Ludlow, the founding director of Center for
European Policy Studies in Brussels. ``But I'm still somewhat
skeptical of their ability to get there. ``The body language is
still not good. The Austrians better not crow too soon or too
loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his withdrawal of any threat to disrupt the coming
negotiations on expansion, Schuessel did not call off a referendum
on the EU sanctions that is planned for the fall if sanctions are
not lifted by then.
</P>
<P>
   Other EU countries have criticized the idea, fearing that the
Freedom Party will use the campaign to whip up anti-EU feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of the European Union's executive body,
Romano Prodi, who has been largely silent on the issue of the
sanctions, criticized them this week saying they should now be
ended ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said Prodi was willing to speak out now
because it was clear the sanctions had failed to achieve their
purpose and were fueling anti-EU sentiment in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in general terms that sanctions give better
results than those achieved in serious, vigorous, in-depth
dialogue.'' Prodi said.

WHAT IS MORALE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 16, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truman Bewley is a mathematical economist out of your worst
dreams. Hyperplanes, non-convexities and all the rest of the
apparatus with which the logical coherance of economic thought is
examined hold no terrors for him. A 1970 Berkeley PhD, the Alfred
Cowles professor of economics at Yale University, Bewley served for
years as editor of the Journal of Mathematical Economics.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not without interest to learn that for the past eight
years Bewley has spent his spare time interviewing businessmen,
labor leaders, counselors to the unemployed and business
consultants in and around New Haven and New York with a view to
discovering why labor markets don't behave like commodity markets,
in which prices routinely fluctuate up and down.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book, ``Why Don't Wages Fall During a Recession?''
is an eye-opener. Not only does it convey an answer to the title
question. It illuminates something of the nature of economic
inquiry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bewley's conclusion is that the desire to encourage loyalty is
the only convincing explanation of the nearly universal preference
for layoffs to wage reductions. ``My findings support none of the
existing economic theories . . . except those emphasizing the
impact of paycuts on morale.''
</P>
<P>
   You must understand that the failure of wages to fall during
periods of slow business is one of the enduring mysteries of modern
economics _ at least to those who are professionally trained.
Potato prices decline when supply exceeds demand. Why not the same
with workers? Matters would be so much simpler if they did!
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why don't firms and workers agree to cut wages and
salaries when revenues decline during recessions? Then layoffs
could be avoided altogether, or nearly so. Profitability could be
maintained. Wouldn't everybody be better off with flexible wages?
</P>
<P>
   Economists have devised all sorts of theories to explain wage
rigidity. Some say that in fact wages are flexible, that when
implicit wages fall too low people leave their jobs because they
prefer leisure to low-pay work.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that groups of company insiders, powerful because of
seniority, refuse to take wage cuts and instead force
recently-hired ``outsiders'' to be let go. There are shirking
models and relative wage models and implicit contract models.
Bewley says that he himself ``wasted years inventing theories to
describe impediments to pay cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Bewley began calling on decisionmakers. Instead of
asking what they thought of economists' theories, he sought to
discover how they explained their practices among themselves. He
learned to ask questions for ninety minutes, two hours or sometimes
more, making careful notes.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was that in general the managers in his sample
``organize their thinking about their success in dealing with
employees around the concept of morale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is having employees feel good about working for the
company and respecting it. The employee with good morale likes his
work and is willing to cooperate in moving from job to job. A
positive attitude makes it possible to work out good teamwork.'' So
explained the owner of a non-union manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
   And so stated the very first manager interviewed the view that
eventually would become Bewley's own:``that cutting pay would have
almost no impact on company employment, that hiring new workers at
reduced pay would antagonize them, that reducing the pay of
existing employees was nearly unthinkable because of the impact on
worker attitudes, and that the advantage of lay-offs over pay
reduction is that they `get the misery out the door.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But don't employers these days routinely impose ``two-tier'' pay
scales on new employees? Don't they they contrive cuts in real (as
opposed to nominal) pay by delaying raises and speeding up the rate
of work? Of course they do, says Bewley. And such strategems in the
face of technical change and recession need to be closely studied
as well. But one thing they don't do is cut money wages, except in
the rarest of circumstances. And the reason commonly given is the
effect on motivation and the sense of community. The main cause of
wage rigity ``are best thought of as having to do with
generosity,'' he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Bewley is tough on his fellow economists. ``The subject of
economics has an enormous impact on everyone's life, and yet the
discipline lacks the status of a real science, follows rather than
leads ideological trends, and sometimes indulges in fanciful
technical representations of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Many theorists concerned with unemployment don't even bother to
raise the possibility of fieldwork designed to resolve the
ambiguity. Hence Bewley's determined demonstration of the
possibilities. Somebody, he says, `` just has to do the work.''

NEW SPENDING DATA SHOWS LITTLE LETUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' shoppers kept spending through the spring
despite an uninspiring stock market and increases in interest rates
and gasoline prices, according to government reports issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts said, a superheated U.S. economy may not
be cooling to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Board , which
over the last year has raised the cost of borrowing money on six
occasions as it seeks to keep prices in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got an economy that's slowing but that may not be
slowing enough,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Bank One
Corp. in Chicago. She said the risks were still high that the
Federal Reserve would decide it needed to raise interest rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market's reaction to Friday's economic data was swift:
Prices fell, raising yields, as traders and investors decided that
a bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales last month _ on top of
a hefty upward revision for May _ outweighed a relatively
market-friendly report on June producer prices.
</P>
<P>
   A third survey, on industrial output for June, showed the
smallest increase in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales, according to the Commerce Department's initial
estimate, climbed 0.5 percent last month, to $269.3 billion, with
about 70 percent of the gain spent at automotive dealers and about
half the rest at gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase was not much more than had been expected,
analysts said, it was from a base in May that was considerably
higher than first reported, as the department's statisticians,
using more complete data, transformed what had been a decline of
0.3 percent in retail sales into a gain of 0.3 percent. Retail
sales, which account for about half of consumer spending and
one-third of all economic activity, are widely watched for clues to
current conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's report on prices paid to producers, which
excludes both services and imported goods, showed a 0.6 percent
advance for finished goods; the rise was largely driven by oil and
natural gas. While this matched expectations, economists said they
were surprised that the so-called core rate, which excludes energy
and food, edged down 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in May,
the first drop since January.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Glassman, an economist and a managing director of Chase
Securities, went so far as to call it ``stunning'' that the long
run-up in energy prices has spilled over so little into other
sectors. ``Underlying inflation remains well behaved,'' he said,
adding that an enormous, continuing corporate appetite for
high-technology equipment implies further anti-inflation pressure
by rising productivity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goods at the intermediate stage of production, like a sack of
flour, climbed 0.9 percent last month, while raw materials jumped
5.8 percent, in both cases reflecting the surge in energy costs.
Recently, Swonk said, gasoline prices have dropped sharply in the
Midwest, where they had risen the most.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial production report, compiled by the Federal
Reserve, showed that the nation's factories, mines and utilities
raised output 0.2 percent last month, a little less than expected,
compared with a 0.5 percent rise in May.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles, semiconductors and business equipment were the main
contributors to the gain, with output slackening for appliances,
clothing, steel and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The next scheduled meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers, who
last month found signs of economic slowdown ``still tentative and
preliminary,'' is on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Friday, the National Association for
Business Economics published a survey that found that one-third of
businesses were able to offset higher costs by raising prices
during the second quarter, the highest proportion since the first
quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pricing power has improved,'' said Swonk, who is currently the
association's president. ``It makes the Fed awfully cautious.''

A DOT-COM REVOLUTION IN CHINA AS VENTURE CAPITAL BACKS TALENTED
ENTREPRENEURS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's economy is throwing millions of people out of
work each year, but an unemployed Internet journalist, Shao Ying,
says she can get a job whenever she wants among the hundreds of
Internet companies opening offices here.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes widened when asked how she could be certain to find one
that pays if so few Chinese Internet companies have any revenue.
The answer, to her, is as obvious as the mole on Mao Zedong's chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' she replies. ``Didn't you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Shao is right: Hundreds of millions of U.S. investment dollars
have fattened the bank accounts of China's young Internet
entrepreneurs over the last year, making dot-com companies the most
vibrant part of the country's fledgling but still struggling
private sector. And despite the high-technology stock slump in the
United States, as much as $1 billion more in venture capital, most
of it from America, is hovering overhead waiting to dive into
China's fast-developing Internet industry, venture capitalists say.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of cash into private hands is unprecedented here
under Communist Party rule. It also is particularly conspicuous
given the enormous financing difficulties that many budding Chinese
entrepreneurs confront in a society that still officially
discourages real capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The money also could quickly vanish or move elsewhere if foreign
venture capitalists decide China is not worth the risk, leaving
people like Shao stranded.
</P>
<P>
   But if the money keeps coming, the impact could be as big as the
breakup of the country's Maoist communes 20 years ago. A
capital-backed private sector may be the economy's best hope for
survival as hundreds of millions of workers spill from sinking
state-owned enterprises, and foreign competitors eagerly await
China's market opening after it joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since a fledgling private sector reappeared
in the late 1970s, a group of private businesses here are
accumulating capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is seeing a core entrepreneurship being established that
is different from the old one, which never really grew because it
didn't have access to capital,'' said Dong Tao, an economist with
Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The new entrepreneurs, many with U.S. educations or U.S.
companies on their resumes, are outrunning China's ideologically
hobbled bureaucracy not only because of their youth but because
they are supported by a powerful constituency abroad: men and women
often times not much older who represent millions of dollars in
investment capital and are not intimidated by China's authoritarian
government or its Byzantine rules.
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry night in June, more than 200 young men and women
crowded into a fashionable Shanghai restaurant, each person wearing
a colored sticker on their lapel identifying them as either someone
looking for money (red) or someone with money to give (green).
Rapid-fire volleys of industry jargon marked conversations around
the room. One Chinese man told a Silicon Valley banker that his Web
site would handle transactions next year worth 1 billion yuan,
about $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who here would like Goldman, Sachs to underwrite their Nasdaq
IPO?'' a young man in a white-collared blue shirt shouted from atop
a chair in an effort to get the crowd's attention for the evening's
speaker from the U.S. investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like their counterparts in the United States, men and women in
their 20s have emerged from such evenings to find themselves
deploying millions of dollars, in some cases tens of millions of
dollars, almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The money is not yet sinking very deeply into China's economy.
Buses and bus stops in most major cities have been taken over by
dot-com advertising. And interior design firms are doing a booming
business. At Internet auctioneer Eachnet.com's sleek offices in a
new Shanghai bank building, visitors are greeted by an orange-tiled
wall bearing the company's logo _ recently redesigned by a Japanese
firm. Against the glass wall of the chief operating officer's
office lean presentations from a handful of interior design
companies showing various high-tech versions of the company's new
offices soon to be built in another building a few doors away.
</P>
<P>
   But as China's old Marxists know, capital is power and if the
country's young Internet entrepreneurs can hang onto their assets
and make them grow, they could emerge as a potent force shaping the
country's economic _ and political _ future.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the massive capital formation is limited mostly to
Internet companies, though China is exploring ways to make it
easier for original investors in a business to cash out when it
goes public.
</P>
<P>
   China's regulators are considering a second board on the
country's stock exchanges that might allow share sales by companies
before they are profitable, for example. And Chinese startups can,
in theory, list their shares on a second board already operating in
Hong Kong. Several domestic venture capital funds have even
appeared, though they are mostly government controlled.
</P>
<P>
   If that model takes hold, it could fundamentally alter economic
life in China, where, despite 20 years of changes that have made
the economy more flexible and market-driven, the nearly ubiquitous
state still decides how resources are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many good mechanisms have been introduced to China, such as
venture capital and stock options, which will help trigger the
restructuring of industries throughout the country,'' says Wang
Zhidong, chief executive of Sina.com, one of the few mainland
Chinese Internet companies to list shares on Nasdaq so far. He says
the success of those private businesses will also influence the
country's attitude toward its educated youth, who remain suspect in
the eyes of many Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   But China's notoriously slow government must act quickly or the
dot-com phenomenon might disappear as quickly as it came without
having made much of an impression on the country's economic
landscape. Venture capitalists, despairing of any easy exit through
which to sell their investments, may move on, leaving China's
fledgling Internet industry gasping for cash. The Ministry of
Information Industries already estimates that most of the country's
16,000 Web sites will be gone by year-end for lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   For now, few of China's Internet companies are seriously
considering raising capital at home. Current listing requirements
make that impossible and the approval to go public is a political
favor that private companies rarely win.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the foreign investment in China's Internet sector
remains technically illegal under rules barring foreign ownership
of value-added telecommunications services. In June, China's stock
market regulators issued a new rule requiring companies that want
to list abroad to first submit to Beijing documents detailing their
ownership structure and showing that it adheres to Chinese law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even Sina.com had to strip its primary asset _ the mainland
China Sina.com Web site _ from its Cayman Islands shell company to
get Beijing's approval to list on Nasdaq. Investors in the U.S.
stock own a stake in the shell and its ancillary Chinese-language
Web sites in Hong Kong, Taiwan and North America, but not in the
Chinese operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals angling for a Nasdaq listing are having to do the same,
but acknowledge that China's changing rules could make even the
restructured operations illegal. Sohu.com, one of the China's most
popular Internet portals, stated in a recent Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that ``relevant PRC authorities could,
at any time, assert that any portion or all of our existing or
future ownership structure and businesses, or this offering,
violate existing or future PRC laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with China expecting to join the World Trade Organization
later this year, a feeling of invincibility _ some say hubris _ has
permeated the industry. ``The same deference isn't being paid to
the ministries and bureaucrats as was paid in the past,'' says Greg
Shea, an American who is working for a venture capital fund
sponsored by Siemens AG and one of China's own investment
companies, China International Trust and Investment Corp. The money
Shea's company is investing comes from a
telecommunications-equipment-leasing business that was unwound last
year after China declared that the structure violated Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the current trend does die without transforming China's
economy, it has taught a group of bright, ambitious young people
the basic tools of capitalism. And not all of those people are
likely to go away. Michael Brownrigg of the San Francisco-based
Chinavest, one of the first venture capital firms to invest in
China, said, ``The Internet shows that young people can run
businesses here and that will resonate for a long time to come.''

JAN KARSKI DIES AT 86; WARNED WEST ABOUT HOLOCAUST
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Karski, a liaison officer of the Polish underground who
infiltrated both the Warsaw Ghetto and a German concentration camp
and then carried the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to
a mostly disbelieving West, died Thursday in Washington. Karski, a
retired professor of history at Georgetown University, was 86.
</P>
<P>
   He died of heart and kidney ailments at Georgetown University
Hospital, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1942, Karski, then a 28-year-old
clandestine diplomat in Warsaw for the Polish government-in-exile
in London, was preparing for a secret mission to carry information
from Nazi-occupied Poland to London and Washington. Before leaving
Warsaw, he was visited by two leaders of the Jewish underground who
had managed to leave the ghetto briefly to tell him about what they
called ``Hitler's war against the Polish Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   They said that by their calculations, more than 1.8 million Jews
had already been killed by the Germans and that 300,000 of the
500,000 Jews jammed into the Warsaw Ghetto had been deported to an
obscure village about 60 miles from Warsaw where the Germans had
set up a death camp.
</P>
<P>
   They asked him if he could carry their information to Winston
Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. They also asked if he would be
willing to enter the ghetto and see for himself what was happening.
Karski, a Roman Catholic from a patriotic Polish family who seemed
to have been blessed with a photographic memory, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   By that time he had already endured a horrible war.
</P>
<P>
   Karski was his nom de guerre; he had been born Jan Kozielewski,
the youngest of eight children, in Lodz, Poland's second-largest
city, on April 24, 1914. He was a prize student and was recruited
into the Polish diplomatic service, where he was quickly given
coveted assignments to London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But as war approached, he enlisted in the army and was serving
as a cavalry officer in 1939 when German soldiers, followed less
than two weeks later by Russian troops, invaded Poland and divided
the country. Karski was captured by the Soviets and placed in a
detention camp. He escaped and joined the Polish underground. Most
of the Polish officers imprisoned with him were later executed by
Soviet troops.
</P>
<P>
   Karski became a skilled courier for the underground, crossing
enemy lines as a liaison between the Polish fighters and the West.
He was captured by the Gestapo while on a mission in Slovakia in
1940 and was savagely tortured. Fearful that he might reveal
secrets, he slashed his wrists and was put into a hospital. An
underground commando team helped him escape, and he resumed his
work as a clandestine liaison officer.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1939, the Germans enclosed the main Jewish areas in
Warsaw with barbed wire. In less than a year the ghetto was walled
in, trapping half a million Jews. By July 1942 the first mass
deportations of Jews to extermination camps had begun.
</P>
<P>
   In the third week of August 1942, Karski entered the cellar of
an apartment house on the so-called Aryan side of the ghetto wall
and met with a youth from the Jewish Combat Organization, then
secretly being formed in the ghetto. The youth gave him some ragged
clothes and an armband with a blue Star of David and led him
through a recently dug tunnel. As they emerged, Karski saw the
ghetto streets and tenements crowded with haggard, hungry and dying
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, when asked to describe what he had seen, Karski
would usually simply say, ``I saw terrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   But on some occasions, for example in ``Shoah,'' Claude
Lanzmann's classic documentary about the Holocaust, he would tell
of seeing many naked bodies lying in the streets and describe
emaciated and starving people, listless infants and older children
with expressionless eyes. He remembered watching from an apartment
while two pudgy teen-age boys in the uniforms of the Hitler Youth
hunted Jews for sport, cheering and laughing when one of their
rifle shots struck its target and brought screams of agony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Jews who had prompted Karski to enter the ghetto, and
who escorted him, was a lawyer named Leon Feiner. Karski recalled
that Feiner kept murmuring, ``Remember this, remember this.'' There
was also another escort whose name Karski never learned. They both
urged Karski to tell what he was witnessing to as many people in
the West as he could, though they knew the facts would be hard to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Karski's visit, the expulsions from Warsaw had
temporarily subsided, but they were to intensify in September as
the liquidation of the ghetto resumed in earnest. Feiner was among
the hundreds of thousands who died.
</P>
<P>
   There were five points that the two men in the ghetto asked
Karski to pass on to the Allied leaders:
</P>
<P>
   _ Preventing the extermination of the Jews should be declared an
official goal of the Allies fighting Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allied propaganda should be used to inform the German people
of the war crimes taking place and to publicize the names of German
officials taking part.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Allies should appeal to the German people to bring
pressure on Hitler's regime to stop the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Allies should declare that if the genocide continued and
the German masses did not rise to stop it, the German people would
be held collectively responsible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, if nothing else worked, the Allies should carry out
reprisals by bombing German cultural sites and executing Germans in
Allied hands who still professed loyalty to Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Karski later said that the Jews' proposals were ``bitter and
unrealistic,'' as if they knew such a program could not and would
not be carried out, and that he had told them their five points
went beyond international law.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his life he remembered the response of the man
accompanying Feiner: ``We don't know what is realistic, or not
realistic. We are dying here! Say it!''
</P>
<P>
   Karski asked what he should say to Jewish leaders abroad.
Unhesitatingly his hosts told him that such leaders should consider
hunger strikes, fasting to death if necessary, to shake the
conscience of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Feiner then asked if Karski was still ready to carry out another
fact-finding mission: Would he be willing to see for himself what
was happening at one of the camps to which the train loads of Jews
were being sent?
</P>
<P>
   Karski consented, and a few days later he and a member of the
Jewish resistance went by train from Warsaw to Izbica, a small town
near Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   There, his Jewish guide turned him over to the owner of a
hardware store who was a member of the Polish underground. Karski
was given the uniform of a Ukrainian militiaman working under the
German command who had been bribed to take the day off. Another
Ukrainian guard _ also bribed _ then led him to a large area
encircled by barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Karski heard keening cries of men and women and thought he
smelled burning flesh. Soon he witnessed the arrival of several
thousand starving and frightened Jews who had been brought to the
camp from Czechoslovakia. He watched as their valises and bags were
taken away from them. Then he saw Jews being beaten and stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Ranks of uniformed men pressed the crowd onto waiting box cars
that had been coated with quicklime. Those who fell or fainted or
who could not move were thrown into the cars. When no more bodies
could fit inside, the doors were shut. Karski was told that the
trains were heading for a camp not far away where their human cargo
would be led into gas chambers. But he was also told that sometimes
the trains were just left on sidings until those inside starved or
suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Karski returned to Warsaw to prepare himself for his dangerous
journey to London. He was given a key whose soldered shaft
contained microfilm of hundreds of documents. He went to a dentist
and had several teeth pulled so that the resultant swelling could
provide him with a reason why he couldn't talk if he was stopped by
Germans; he was certain his Polish-accented German would give him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Using local trains, he went to Berlin, the capital of the Reich,
then through Vichy France to Spain, where a rendezvous led to
passage to Gibraltar and then to London.
</P>
<P>
   He turned over the key containing the microfilm, described
resistance activity and assessed as bleak the prospects of
cooperation between the anti-communist Polish underground and the
partisans, who were sponsored by the same Soviets who in 1939 had
joined Hitler in invading and dividing Poland.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the Jews, saying their fate was far more perilous
than that of non-Jewish Poles. But for many of his Polish
diplomatic superiors, the plight of the Jews remained marginal to
Poland's struggle to regain its conquered land. Some even feared
that any emphasis on the victimization of the Jews might detract
attention from Poland's tragedy and diminish their own appeals for
help.
</P>
<P>
   And when Karski carried his information about the destruction of
the Jews to British authorities, he was met by even greater
reluctance to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``In February 1943, I reported to Anthony Eden,'' he later wrote
about a secret meeting with the British foreign secretary. ``He
said that Great Britain had already done enough by accepting
100,000 refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Karski met with Szmuel Zygelboym, who represented the
Jewish Socialist Bund in the National Council of the Polish
government-in-exile, to present the Polish Jews' urgings of active
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Zygelboym listened in pain but then said, ``It's impossible,
utterly impossible.'' If he went on a hunger strike, he said, the
authorities would send the police and drag him away to an
institution. But he added: ``I'll do everything I can do to help
them. I'll do everything they ask.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, on May 12, 1943, just after the Germans put
down the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Zygelboym sent a letter to the
president and prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile, and
then took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``By my death I wish to make my final protest against
the passivity with which the world is looking on and permitting the
annihilation of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1943, Karski arrived in the United States. Two months
earlier, attempts by the Germans to liquidate those Jews still
remaining in the Warsaw Ghetto was met with armed resistance. In a
desperate, uneven struggle over three weeks, the Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising, more than 10,000 Jews were killed in the fighting or in
fires set by the Germans to destroy the ghetto. The 56,000 Jews
remaining were taken to the Treblinka death camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every individual was sympathetic to my reports
concerning the Jews,'' Karski said. ``But when I reported to the
leaders of governments, they discarded their conscience, their
personal feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provided a rationale which seemed valid. What was the
situation? The Jews were totally helpless. The war strategy was the
military defeat of Germany and the defeat of Germany's war
potential for all eternity. Nothing could interfere with the
military crushing of the Third Reich. The Jews had no country, no
government. They were fighting, but they had no identity.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept telling what he knew, honoring the promise he had given
to the two men in the ghetto. A secret meeting was arranged between
Karski and Roosevelt. He said that commanders of the underground
Home Army were estimating that if there was to be no Allied
intervention in the next year and a half, the Jews of Poland would
``cease to exist.'' He did not tell Roosevelt of his own
experiences or observations.
</P>
<P>
   Karski believed that he failed to move Roosevelt to any real
action. But John Pehle, who became head of the War Refugee Board, a
federal agency that helped settle surviving Jews, said later that
Roosevelt had decided to establish the board as a consequence of
his talks with Karski. The mission, Pehle said, ``changed U.S.
policy overnight from indifference to affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Karski was planning to return to Warsaw and resume his
clandestine work, but his superiors told him that his identity had
become known to the Germans and ordered him to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   His mission then was to promote the cause of Poland, which once
freed of German occupation would have to contend with Stalin's
designs. He gave newspaper and radio interviews, wrote magazine
articles and drew on his own experiences to write a book, ``Story
of a Secret State,'' which was published at the end of 1944 by
Houghton Mifflin and became a Book of the Month Club selection.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year the war came to an end, and so did the Polish
government-in-exile that Karski had served. The Yalta agreement had
consigned postwar Poland to the Soviet sphere, and Karski, who knew
and scorned communism, did not return to his native land.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at the age of 39, he enrolled at the School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown. He received his doctorate in 2{ years and
stayed on, teaching at Georgetown until his retirement in 1984. He
became a U.S. citizen in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he married Pola Nirenska, a dancer and choreographer who
had been born Pola Nirensztajn in Poland, the daughter of an
observant Jewish father. All her many relatives had been killed in
the Holocaust, but she had survived the war in London and had
become a major force in dance in Washington _ teaching,
choreographing her own work and leading her own company _ when they
met.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Pola Nirenska, then 81, jumped to her death from the
balcony of their apartment in Bethesda, Md. Her last dance piece,
presented in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims
she had known and was called ``In Memory of Those I Loved ... Who
Are No More.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after her death, Karski established a $5,000 annual prize
to be awarded by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research to authors
documenting or interpreting Jewish contributions to Polish culture
and science.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Karski leaves no immediate survivors.

SUSPECT IN WORCESTER FIRE RELEASED TO CUSTODY OF MAINE COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ ``Hi!'' yelled Julie Barnes into a celluar
phone with a cheerful voice as she motored off to a new life in
Maine in the backseat of Debb and Tim King's car.
</P>
<P>
   She had no possessions. But she was out of prison, heading
north, hundreds of miles from the scene of the fire that devastated
a community just seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, now 20, and her one-time boyfriend, Thomas Levesque, 37,
were arrested last December in the wake of the Worcester warehouse
fire. Six firefighters died battling the blaze, and Barnes and
Levesque were each charged with involuntary manslaughter in the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the pair, who had been squatting in the
warehouse, set the fire accidentally and left the building without
telling anyone. Barnes was taken to the state women's prison in
Framingham. Her bail was set at $1 million at first, then lowered
to $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Things seemed bleaker than ever for the 19-year-old, three
months pregnant at the time. By friends' accounts, the young woman
who had drifted for years between her parent's homes and the
streets was also mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But her prospects changed when the Kings saw Barnes' picture in
a newspaper, a few weeks after the fire. She bore an uncanny
resemblance to their adopted daughter, Jennifer, who had mental
disabilities but had thrived in their care. They quickly discovered
that Julie and Jennifer were sisters, separated by the state
Department of Social Services 16 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings grew determined to raise the money to bail Julie out
of prison, hoping they could bring her to Maine and give her some
of the social supports she lacked throughout her life. On Thursday
they had a breakthrough: a Worcester Superior Court judge reduced
Barnes' bail from $75,000 to $25,000, and said she could be
released into their care.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday morning the Kings came from Maine, handed prison
officials $25,000 in cash, and prepared to meet Julie at the prison
door.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tumultuous day for Julie, Debb King said. She didn't
realize she was leaving prison until officers came to her cell and
told her to pack her bags. She seemed shocked to see the Kings at
the door, and was crying. But she also gave them big hugs.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a tumult of activity, King said: a drive to a
probation office, where Barnes signed papers agreeing to the
conditions of her bail; a press conference at her lawyers' office,
where the cameras intimidated her.
</P>
<P>
   But by mid-afternoon, she was in the Kings' car, calm and
cheery. Tim King was showing her how the gadgets on the dashboard
worked. They stopped at a gas station, and Barnes spotted a dog.
``Hey, look at the doggie!'' she cried out, and went over to pet
it.
</P>
<P>
   Into the cellphone, Barnes yelled that she felt ``good right
now. At least I'm out of Framingham.''
</P>
<P>
   And Debb King said she, too, felt relived that the months-long
campaign was over. Now, she said, she wants to ``try to go home and
find a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long road to their destination, Ellsworth, Maine, where
Debb King runs a travel agency and Tim King is city manager. Once
there, the first order of business will be shopping, Debb King
said; Barnes has no clothes except for the sweatshirt and jeans she
was given in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, there will be serious work to do: connecting Barnes to
social service programs that will teach her life skills. Some of
the training might help her care for Joshua, the baby boy she
delivered in prison last month.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is now in foster care, and the Kings say they will work
with the state Department of Social Services to determine what's
best for his future.
</P>
<P>
   And a most important task will come a week from Saturday, Debb
King said. Jennifer King is away from home _ for the first time
ever _ working as a counselor's aide in a summer camp. She doesn't
realize her sister is coming to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   So her parents plan to surprise her. When they drive to camp to
pick her up, they said, they will bring Julie along.

 &HT;    Glover out to prove himself
 &HT;    By Monique Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, magazine covers touted Dion Glover as
the next superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quickly as his departure from Georgia Tech, everyone
turned the page.
</P>
<P>
   Glover was left behind to recover from tearing the anterior
cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee at the
beginning of his sophomore season at Tech. Even though he did not
play one minute of basketball that year, Glover was picked 20th
overall by the Hawks in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 guard has been surviving on potential to this
point. Granted, he was one of Tech's leading scorers while he was
there and was 1997's Mr. Georgia Basketball at Cedar Grove High.
</P>
<P>
   But now he wants to receive accolades in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to prove to myself I belong here,'' Glover said. ``I
never want to feel complacent. I have to prove to me and to
everyone else this is where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Going from being one of Tech's leading scorers in the 1997-98
season (18.4 points 5 rebounds a game) to averaging 6.5 points a
game his rookie season with the Hawks was something Glover had
never been through before.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time in his career that he wasn't a
starter,'' said Karl McCray, one of Glover's AAU coaches during his
high school days. ``Everybody knew he had extraordinary talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just wanted to see how he would respond to his knee
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover recovered from the injury with little trouble, but said
he had to adjust to playing against quicker, bigger and smarter
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Against the New York Knicks in March, Glover said he could only
watch as he was faked out and left ``picking my face up off the
ground,'' by a quick move to the basket. He had nine points
(3-for-6) in that game, which the Hawks lost. But it was a part of
his learning experience to become quicker and stronger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an experience he would have to learn primarily from
the bench. Glover played in 30 games, averaging 4.9 minutes last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Glover has started both games in the Hawks Summer Shootout and
has been the Hawks' leading scorer, averaging 20.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie guard Scoonie Penn said it has been an experience helping
Glover create opportunities on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dion Glover is a great penetrator and he likes to get into
position where he can create and get to the basket. That's how he's
effective,'' Penn said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he hopes that effectiveness lasts into the regular
season. It is an attitude first-year coach Lon Kruger said he hopes
extends to the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should all feel that way and that's the nature of
being a better basketball player,'' Kruger said. ``Dion has worked
hard this summer and he's making progress. As Dion says, he just
has to keep working hard at it, and that's a good attitude to have
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of having the world handed to him, Glover said he is
working to return to his old form.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee is 100 percent right now,'' Glover said. ``It feels
great, and I'm feeling more comfortable. I just need to get the
confidence mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready. I'm always ready.''

BYSTANDER VIDEOTAPES PROLIFERATE, BUT RARELY END IN MAJOR
JUDGMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Ga., Mass., Md., Fla.)   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the nine years since George Holliday, a Los Angeles plumber
standing on the balcony of his apartment, videotaped the vicious
police beating of Rodney King, tapes made by onlookers have become
a potent legal and political tool.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with two more beatings by police officers videotaped
by news helicopters in Philadelphia and in Lawrenceville, Ga., the
images are as powerful as ever, once again inspiring protesters who
say they are a uniquely vivid display of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of 18 recent cases involving such tapes shows that
the police officers captured on film often face no criminal
charges, or the cases end in acquittals. Even the civil lawsuits
that often follow tend to end in minor judgments.
</P>
<P>
   That is no surprise, prosecutors, defense lawyers and other
legal experts say, since bystander videotapes rarely present a
complete picture of an incident, often capturing only the last few
seconds of a violent chase or confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Facing videotapes in police brutality cases, therefore, defense
lawyers generally argue, as they did successfully in the first
prosecution growing out of the Rodney King beatings, that because
the video caught only a piece of the interaction, it missed the
context and the act of defiance that led to the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, hurried amateur tapes of violent attacks that last
seconds rarely provide clear views of precisely who is doing what,
even making it hard to tell which officer struck a particular blow.
For example, in the Philadelphia case, a frame-by-frame analysis of
the video by The Philadelphia Inquirer showed that the victim was
punched and kicked 59 times in 28 seconds before a supervisor
rushed in and backed the officers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapes don't automatically lead to prosecution, because the
legal standard is one of reasonableness,'' said Austin Sarat, a
professor of law and political science at Amherst College. ``So
what appears to us on the outside as absolutely reprehensible,
might look to a prosecutor like bad behavior that, under the
circumstances, would not convince a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sarat said the easy availability of video cameras was a
positive development in helping to make cases against police
officers who were brutal, ``you can't just say, `Oh, gee, these
prosecutors should take these cases.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost every one of the incidents spurs local protests,
and if, as is often but not always the case, the police officers
are white and the victims black or Hispanic, the tapes rekindle
deep racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the most famous case growing out of a videotaped police
beating, an all-white jury in Simi Valley, Calif., acquitted the
four officers charged with beating Rodney King. The verdict set off
riots that took more than 50 lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two of the officers were convicted in a federal court
of violating King's civil rights. And a year later, a Los Angeles
jury awarded King $3.8 million in damages for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But many other cases never get to court:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1994 case in Compton, Calif., a police officer who was
sent to a trailer park to interview several siblings thought to be
neglected smashed the oldest child in the face with his baton, hit
him repeatedly after he fell to the ground, handcuffed the boy and
used the baton to drag him to a police car, a sequence videotaped
by the boy's godmother, a neighbor. The officer, Michael Jackson,
said that what the tape missed was that he had been threatened and
racially insulted by the boy, 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, and
struck by a younger sister. The district attorney did not charge
Jackson with any crime. A civil jury awarded Soltero, who suffered
a concussion but no broken bones, $1 in damages for the beating.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1997 Baltimore case, in which a bystander recorded the
fatal police shooting of James Quarles on a crowded August night at
the Lexington Market, the prosecutor said there was no probable
cause for manslaughter or murder charges. In the video, Quarles has
his back to the camera as four police officers point handguns at
him, so it is impossible to tell precisely what he is doing, but it
is clear that he has a knife in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1998 case in Broward County, Fla., a grand jury would not
indict a Fort Lauderdale police officer of any wrongdoing in the
alleged beating of a schizophrenic man, John Clements, videotaped
by two Polish tourists. The grand jury was apparently unconvinced
that it had enough information about what had happened off-camera.
But Clements later settled his civil claims against the city for
$210,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1998 Pittsburgh case, state troopers were videotaped
beating Evan Gross after a car chase. In the tape, Gross is seen
getting out of the car with his hands up and being ordered to lie
on the ground, where troopers swarmed over him, punching and
kneeing him. An Allegheny County grand jury, citing testimony from
two police experts in the use of force, decided not to recommend
filing excessive-force charges against any of the troopers, and the
police officers were permitted to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   In those and other cases, lawyers for the beating victims say,
the videotape did not overcome a presumption in favor of the police
_ or the sense that what took place before the tape began rolling
would provide a legitimate explanation for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors and police officers work together all the time,''
said Stewart Greenberg, the lawyer for Clements in Fort Lauderdale.
``No one wants to believe a police officer would ever do anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clements case, Greenberg said, the tape did not stand up
to the officer's lawyer's argument that without knowing what
happened off-camera, it was unfair to charge his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense lawyer's argument is always going to be that the
tape started at X moment, but missed the crucial moment that came
earlier, at X minus 5,'' said Peter Kirchheimer, supervising
attorney at the Federal Defenders Division of the Legal Aid
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, videotapes are a massive political fact,'' Kirchheimer
added. ``Normally, the criminal justice system is pretty opaque,
and people don't see what happened. Charges don't usually get
brought against the police unless there's egregious injuries like
the perforated rectum in the Louima case _ or a videotape. They're
the thousand-pound elephant, and they change the whole balance.''
</P>
<P>
   As they make their way through the criminal justice system, the
newest cases may face the same problems as their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Philadelphia television stations repeatedly played
the tapes of a group of police officers beating and kicking a man
accused of stealing a police car and shooting at officers in a
mile-long chase. The suspect, Thomas Jones, was treated for five
bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the King case, in which the police were white and the
victim black, the Philadelphia case involved both black and white
officers. While the tapes vividly show a group of police officers
beating Jones, a 6-foot, 240-pound ex-convict, they do not show how
the incident began: The police say that Jones, who was first
stopped for driving a stolen car, and fled on foot, then grabbed an
officer's gun, began shooting and jumped into a nearby patrol car
to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes show that the guy was subdued, and thereafter
assaulted,'' said Chet Mirsky, a professor of criminal law at New
York University. ``You see the guy down on the ground, being
gratuitously kicked, on a continual basis, by more than one police
officer. But in thinking about what's excessive force, you have to
remember that this is a dangerous person, that anyone in their
right mind would have reason to fear. My guess is that it probably
won't get prosecuted, unless there's just enormous public hue and
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in Lawrenceville, Ga., a news helicopter taped
police officers punching and kicking a drunken driving suspect,
Marshall Dwight Studdard, as he lay on the ground after a 20-minute
chase. But because Studdard is obscured by an officer on the tape,
it is difficult, in that tape, too, to determine what he was doing
during the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just in prosecuting police beatings that
videotapes are becoming a factor. Banks and convenience stores have
long taped their transactions to deter crime. And as video cameras
are more widely used, tapes of public events are becoming almost
ubiquitous, whether of the Justice Department's removal of Elian
Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home, or the recent sexual
violence in New York's Central Park after the National Puerto Rican
Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amateur videotapes are everywhere,'' said Paul Chevigny, a
professor at New York University Law School. ``Look at what
happened in Central Park; they came up with something like 27
videotapes. It's true people are more likely to have cameras at a
parade, but it's also a measure of how much videotaping is out
there now.''

 &HT;    Georgia bests rest of South in professor pay
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The salary gap between college faculty in the South
and the rest of the country has continued to widen over the past
decade, but Georgia has bucked the trend, according to a new report
by the Southern Regional Education Board.
</P>
<P>
   The average faculty salary at a four-year Georgia university in
1998-99 was $56,251, less than $700 below the $56,916 national
average, the SREB report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen
Portch said there are signs Georgia is slipping in its ability to
recruit top faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a crisis mode,'' Portch said, but added, ``It's
something we're going to have to pay attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's ranking among SREB's 16 states _ running from Delaware
south and west to Texas _ rose from 7th to 5th in university
faculty salaries and climbed from 96 percent of the national
average to 99 percent in the past 10 years, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   At $42,141, faculty salaries at two-year schools in Georgia also
rose from 7th to 5th among SREB states, and from 93 percent to 94
percent of the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The university averages include professors, associate
professors, assistant professors and instructors.
</P>
<P>
   As a region, the report said, salaries at four-year schools fell
from 94 percent of the national average in 1988-89 to 93 percent in
1998-99, and from 92 percent to 87 percent of the national average
at two-year schools during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Marks, author of the report, said the regional trend is a
reflection of what's been happening nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that's been going on is nationwide, faculty
salaries have been playing catch-up,'' he said. ``The reason the
region has not been faring as well is we are chasing a moving
target.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1970s and 1980s, he said, faculty salaries did
not keep pace with inflation, so schools have been making up for
lost time in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, college enrollment increases in the South meant
states have had to put more money into providing education and
services. Other areas of the country where enrollment has remained
stagnant or declined may have had more money available to fund pay
hikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When adjusted for inflation, faculty in some states, such as
Texas, Tennessee and Florida, have lost ground in the past 10
years, the report suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of the few SREB states that have gained on the
national average at both four-year and two-year schools. Much of
the state's success can be attributed to 6 percent annual pay hikes
pushed through the General Assembly by former Gov. Zell Miller
during his final term, from 1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Gov. Roy Barnes, has won approval for more modest
pay raises of 4 percent and 3 percent during his first two
legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have significantly improved (over 10 years), but
we have slid a little bit,'' Portch said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia faculty salaries had climbed to 2nd in the SREB _ behind
Virginia _ a few years ago. But the chancellor said when the SREB
added high-paying Delaware, Georgia fell behind North Carolina and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Portch said the market for top faculty is becoming increasingly
competitive. He met with system presidents this week and said they
told him stories of having computer science hires ask for more
money between the time they accepted a job and started work because
they'd gotten more job offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we ask (presidents) is a very honest question: How's your
recruiting been going and how's your retention of top faculty?''
Portch said. ``We're beginning to feel some slippage. Two years
ago, when I asked that question of presidents, they said they got
their first choices.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's economy is throwing millions of people out of
work each year, but an unemployed Internet journalist, Shao Ying,
says she can get a job whenever she wants among the hundreds of
Internet companies opening offices here.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes widened when asked how she could be certain to find one
that pays if so few Chinese Internet companies have any revenue.
The answer, to her, is as obvious as the mole on Mao Tse-tung's
chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' she replies. ``Didn't you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Shao is right: Hundreds of millions of U.S. investment dollars
have fattened the bank accounts of China's young Internet
entrepreneurs over the last year, making dot-com companies the most
vibrant part of the country's fledgling but still struggling
private sector. And despite the high-technology stock slump in the
United States, as much as $1 billion more in venture capital, most
of it from America, is hovering overhead waiting to dive into
China's fast-developing Internet industry, venture capitalists say.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of cash into private hands is unprecedented here
under Communist Party rule. It also is particularly conspicuous
given the enormous financing difficulties that many budding Chinese
entrepreneurs confront in a society that still officially
discourages real capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The money also could quickly vanish or move elsewhere if foreign
venture capitalists decide China is not worth the risk, leaving
people like Shao stranded.
</P>
<P>
   But if the money keeps coming, the impact could be as big as the
breakup of the country's Maoist communes 20 years ago. A
capital-backed private sector may be the economy's best hope for
survival as hundreds of millions of workers spill from sinking
state-owned enterprises, and foreign competitors eagerly await
China's market opening after it joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since a fledgling private sector reappeared
in the late 1970s, a group of private businesses here are
accumulating capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is seeing a core entrepreneurship being established that
is different from the old one, which never really grew because it
didn't have access to capital,'' said Dong Tao, an economist with
Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The new entrepreneurs, many with U.S. educations or U.S.
companies on their resumes, are outrunning China's ideologically
hobbled bureaucracy not only because of their youth but because
they are supported by a powerful constituency abroad: men and women
often times not much older who represent millions of dollars in
investment capital and are not intimidated by China's authoritarian
government or its Byzantine rules.
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry night in June, more than 200 young men and women
crowded into a fashionable Shanghai restaurant, each person wearing
a colored sticker on their lapel identifying them as either someone
looking for money (red) or someone with money to give (green).
Rapid-fire volleys of industry jargon marked conversations around
the room. One Chinese man told a Silicon Valley banker that his Web
site would handle transactions next year worth 1 billion yuan,
about $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who here would like Goldman, Sachs to underwrite their Nasdaq
IPO?'' a young man in a white-collared blue shirt shouted from atop
a chair in an effort to get the crowd's attention for the evening's
speaker from the U.S. investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like their counterparts in the United States, men and women in
their 20s have emerged from such evenings to find themselves
deploying millions of dollars, in some cases tens of millions of
dollars, almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The money is not yet sinking very deeply into China's economy.
Buses and bus stops in most major cities have been taken over by
dot-com advertising. And interior design firms are doing a booming
business. At Internet auctioneer Eachnet.com's sleek offices in a
new Shanghai bank building, visitors are greeted by an orange-tiled
wall bearing the company's logo _ recently redesigned by a Japanese
firm. Against the glass wall of the chief operating officer's
office lean presentations from a handful of interior design
companies showing various high-tech versions of the company's new
offices soon to be built in another building a few doors away.
</P>
<P>
   But as China's old Marxists know, capital is power and if the
country's young Internet entrepreneurs can hang onto their assets
and make them grow, they could emerge as a potent force shaping the
country's economic _ and political _ future.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the massive capital formation is limited mostly to
Internet companies, though China is exploring ways to make it
easier for original investors in a business to cash out when it
goes public.
</P>
<P>
   China's regulators are considering a second board on the
country's stock exchanges that might allow share sales by companies
before they are profitable, for example. And Chinese startups can,
in theory, list their shares on a second board already operating in
Hong Kong. Several domestic venture capital funds have even
appeared, though they are mostly government controlled.
</P>
<P>
   If that model takes hold, it could fundamentally alter economic
life in China, where, despite 20 years of changes that have made
the economy more flexible and market-driven, the nearly ubiquitous
state still decides how resources are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many good mechanisms have been introduced to China, such as
venture capital and stock options, which will help trigger the
restructuring of industries throughout the country,'' says Wang
Zhidong, chief executive of Sina.com, one of the few mainland
Chinese Internet companies to list shares on Nasdaq so far. He says
the success of those private businesses will also influence the
country's attitude toward its educated youth, who remain suspect in
the eyes of many Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   But China's notoriously slow government must act quickly or the
dot-com phenomenon might disappear as quickly as it came without
having made much of an impression on the country's economic
landscape. Venture capitalists, despairing of any easy exit through
which to sell their investments, may move on, leaving China's
fledgling Internet industry gasping for cash. The Ministry of
Information Industries already estimates that most of the country's
16,000 Web sites will be gone by year-end for lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   For now, few of China's Internet companies are seriously
considering raising capital at home. Current listing requirements
make that impossible and the approval to go public is a political
favor that private companies rarely win.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the foreign investment in China's Internet sector
remains technically illegal under rules barring foreign ownership
of value-added telecommunications services. In June, China's stock
market regulators issued a new rule requiring companies that want
to list abroad to first submit to Beijing documents detailing their
ownership structure and showing that it adheres to Chinese law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even Sina.com had to strip its primary asset _ the mainland
China Sina.com Web site _ from its Cayman Islands shell company to
get Beijing's approval to list on Nasdaq. Investors in the U.S.
stock own a stake in the shell and its ancillary Chinese-language
Web sites in Hong Kong, Taiwan and North America, but not in the
Chinese operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals angling for a Nasdaq listing are having to do the same,
but acknowledge that China's changing rules could make even the
restructured operations illegal. Sohu.com, one of the China's most
popular Internet portals, stated in a recent Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that ``relevant PRC authorities could,
at any time, assert that any portion or all of our existing or
future ownership structure and businesses, or this offering,
violate existing or future PRC laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with China expecting to join the World Trade Organization
later this year, a feeling of invincibility _ some say hubris _ has
permeated the industry. ``The same deference isn't being paid to
the ministries and bureaucrats as was paid in the past,'' says Greg
Shea, an American who is working for a venture capital fund
sponsored by Siemens AG and one of China's own investment
companies, China International Trust and Investment Corp. The money
Shea's company is investing comes from a
telecommunications-equipment-leasing business that was unwound last
year after China declared that the structure violated Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the current trend does die without transforming China's
economy, it has taught a group of bright, ambitious young people
the basic tools of capitalism. And not all of those people are
likely to go away. Michael Brownrigg of the San Francisco-based
Chinavest, one of the first venture capital firms to invest in
China, said, ``The Internet shows that young people can run
businesses here and that will resonate for a long time to come.''

JURY VERDICT LAYS BLAME FOR WACO SIEGE ON BRANCH DAVIDIANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Branch Davidians brought death upon
themselves, a federal court jury said Friday in a nonbinding
verdict that vindicated the U.S. government of wrongdoing in the
1993 siege at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a month of testimony, the five-member advisory
panel spent 2 1/2 hours behind closed doors before concluding that
federal agents acted reasonably in the initial raid and didn't
cause the fatal fire that ended the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is that the responsibility for the tragedy
that happened at Waco is with David Koresh and the Branch
Davidians,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford of Beaumont, who
is leading the government's defense in a $675 million wrongful
death lawsuit brought by surviving members of the religious sect
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to put this to rest and move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury said agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms did not use excessive force or fire indiscriminately when
they raided the sect's rural headquarters on Feb. 28, 1993 to serve
search and arrest warrants &UR;  &LR; for weapons charges &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was within
its authority to use tanks to plow into the compound and insert
tear gas in the final hours of the siege on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The panel concluded that the FBI was not negligent for failing
to position firefighters near the complex when it erupted in
flames. A plan to call on nearby communities in case of fire was
sufficient, the jurors determined.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith said he will take the
``advisory'' jury's verdict into account as he continues
deliberating allegations of government negligence and other issues
raised by the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The jury verdict answered five questions posed by Smith. After
they delivered the verdict form, the jurors quickly left the
courthouse. The judge said they did not want to answer reporters'
questions. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Although Smith said he can use the verdict ``in any manner I
see fit,'' lawyers for the Davidians said the findings probably
won't be discarded by the judge, whom they had fought to keep from
trying the case because he presided when five sect members were
convicted on weapons charges in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, when you get a verdict, it's over, at
least with Judge Smith,'' said Davidians' lawyer Michael Caddell of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no judgment against the government issued by
Judge Smith. I wouldn't be foolish enough to suggest otherwise,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also said that for most people, the verdict will end a
seven-year debate about alleged government misconduct at Mount
Carmel. Caddell said the nearly 300 guns found at Mount Carmel
probably swayed the jury more than any other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that quantity of weaponry this close to Waco is just
too much for them,'' Caddell speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Special Counsel John Danforth, appointed by Attorney General
Janet Reno to oversee an independent investigation into the
standoff and fire, declined comment. It is unclear when his probe
will be finished.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes to resume the trial on Aug. 2 to take up a
question that wasn't put to the five-member jury: whether federal
agents fired on the compound when it was engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   That debate was postponed because a court-appointed expert was
unavailable to analyze infrared videos taken during the fire that
could show whether there was FBI gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that no shots were fired by its agents
on the final day of the siege. And a May 19 simulation of the event
by a British firm seemed to support their account. Vector Data
Systems said it believed the flecks of light on the infrared tape
were caused by sunlight glinting off of debris, not government
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, Bradford called the siege a ``terrible
tragedy,'' in part because four ATF agents were killed on the first
day. But he said the deaths of the Davidians were their own fault
because they could have surrendered at any time and weren't
prevented from leaving the compound when fuel-fed fires broke out
at three locations.
</P>
<P>
   The government lawyer said Davidian plaintiffs were ``trying to
distance themselves from David Koresh, and who could blame them?''
Bradford painted Koresh as a ``psychopath'' who claimed to be Jesus
Christ and so dominated his followers that they ``had to get
permission to kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the inventory of weapons, including dozens of fully
automatic rifles, grenades and armor-piercing ammunition, Bradford
said Koresh had been preparing for ``a war'' for a long time.
``That's what they wanted that day when the ATF showed up at Mount
Carmel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government disputed the Davidians' contention that the
decision to penetrate the structure with tanks, ostensibly to open
exit paths for Davidians as well as inject tear gas, was a
departure from the plans approved by Reno.
</P>
<P>
   She approved of subjecting the Davidians to up to 48 hours of
tear gassing before reassessing the situation. The Reno-approved
plan provided for any emergency response to fire to come from
Bellmeade and Waco, but neither fire department had units nearby
when the blaze consumed the compound.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bradford told jurors that ``Davidians were still firing
their weapons out of the compound while the fire was going on,'' so
even if firefighters were there, they wouldn't have been allowed
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' lawyer Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney
general, insisted the Davidians ``didn't want to burn themselves
down. What they did was endure six hours of unbelievable government
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the large stockpile of weapons, Clark said the guns were
bought and sold legally for profit and we not part of a ``war
theory. That's absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark told jurors that unless they ruled against the government,
``no one will be free from the violence of our government. It has
to be stopped,'' he pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   And after the verdict was rendered, survivor Clive Doyle reacted
bitterly, saying, ``The American people need to be praying they're
not next on the (government's) list. You better hope you're not on
the receiving end of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had portrayed the Davidians as unusual but nonviolent,
except for Koresh and a few devoted followers known as Mighty Men.
He said most Davidians were overcome with panic at the end of the
siege but were not bent on mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said no ``emergency'' forced the FBI to act, and he
chastised the agency for departing from a plan to pump tear gas
into the compound for two days. ``They should have let them sit in
it for 48 hours. They (FBI) wanted it (surrender) now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the ensuing fire a ``holocaust,'' Caddell said Davidians
``couldn't get out. By the time they realized the fire had begun,
it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said Davidians who huddled in a concrete bunker were
``trapped'' and were compelled to kill their children and commit
suicide. If he saw a trapped child's skin peeling off from heat,
Caddell said, ``I would take that child's life and I would take
mine as quickly as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidian lawyers agreed that some of the government agents acted
properly, even bravely. Caddell singled out the heroics of FBI
agent James McGee, who entered the burning structure to extract
Davidian Ruth Ottoman Riddle, carrying her to safety even after she
refused to tell McGee where the children were hiding _ in a
concrete bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest thing about this case,'' Caddell said, ``is that
there will be another David Koresh.''

 &HT;    Diseases conference to target complacency
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international corps of scientists who will gather in Atlanta
this evening has a long list of enemies to talk about: HIV,
malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and exotic emerging infections
such as West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief opponent being targeted by the second
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases is
complacency _ the widely held, and completely inaccurate, belief
that infections pose no threat to the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infectious diseases are just not thought of as a major issue
in developed countries,'' said Dr. James Hughes, director of the
National Center for Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. ``People forget that infectious diseases
are the leading cause of death worldwide and the third-leading
cause of death in this country. Legionnaires' disease, AIDS and the
re-emergence of TB have reminded us repeatedly that we do not have
infectious diseases under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, co-sponsored by CDC, the American Society for
Microbiology and the World Health Organization, brings 2,500
researchers and public health specialists to the Marriott Marquis
to examine successes and failures.
</P>
<P>
   Major topics on the agenda include foodborne diseases, such as
the E.coli O157:H7 that sickened hundreds in Ontario in May and
June; insect-borne diseases, such as resurgent malaria and the
tick-borne erlichiosis that recently surfaced in Atlanta; and
animal diseases that unexpectedly cross to humans, such as West
Nile virus, which was never seen in this hemisphere before last
summer. On Wednesday afternoon, there will be a special session on
West Nile, which scientists fear will spread from New York, where
it was first identified, via migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of information presented at this
conference that people will not have heard before,'' Hughes said.
``Much of it has not yet been published. It will be very current.''
</P>
<P>
   Other topics under discussion are the ongoing trend toward
antibiotic resistance among disease organisms; the effects of
climate change, and movements of large groups due to war or
economic change, on the development of disease; and the potential
use of pathogens as weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The conference opens on the heels of a major international
dispute over infectious disease. Throughout the International AIDS
Conference, held last week in Durban, South Africa, South African
President Thabo Mbeki has maintained that HIV may not be the cause
of AIDS and that AZT, a primary drug in AIDS treatment, may not be
as useful against the virus as believed.
</P>
<P>
   In response, 5,000 scientists and physicians signed a protest
letter, now known as the ``Durban declaration,'' that was published
in the scientific journal Nature. Bruce Levin, an evolutionary
biologist at Emory University, was one of the signers of the
declaration. He will speak at the Atlanta conference this week,
presenting research into the twin influences of ecology and
evolution on the emergence of HIV/AIDS as a human disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pragmatic understanding of when and how new i Three thousand
miles away, Niko's 29-year-old brother, Pano Karatassos Jr., takes
a boning knife to a pig's head in the name of gastronomy. He cuts
away the plates of the skull, rolls and ties the remainder in
cheesecloth, and proceeds to prepare a rarefied pig pate called
``tete de cochon.''
</P>
<P>
   As a chef de partie at the French Laundry _ the Napa Valley,
Calif., restaurant called the nation's ``most exciting'' by The New
York Times _ Pano Jr. manages the meat station. For a lunch shift,
he wakes up at 4 a.m. to ready a dozen astonishing dishes _ from
sweetbread-stuffed rabbit shoulder with caramelized salsify, to
veal heart confit with brussels sprout leaves, to a comparatively
straightforward pan-roasted squab with baby turnips, prunes and
foie gras. His muscular 5-foot, 8-inch frame clad in chef's whites
and a blue apron, he anchors a team of identically dressed cooks in
an expansivnature. ``Pano's the most like my dad. He can be anal.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summers, family vacations became eating expeditions,
used as research for new restaurants. ``Whenever we'd go on a trip
it was, `When are we going to eat?' and then, `When are we going to
eat again?''' recalls Pano Jr. ``Sitting down at a restaurant was
playing fill-in-the-blanks because everyone had to order something
different. My brother and I used to race each other to order
first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always over-ordered,'' Pano Sr. recalls. ``I had this table
full of little kids eating escargot and sweetbreads.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids also spent summers working in their father's
restaurants, which were numbering a half-dozen by the end of the
1980s. Niko and Pano Jr. began as prep cooks. One summer, Niko
joined his dad on the floor of Pano's and Paul's as an assistant
waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Pano Jr. quickly graduated from prep cook to pantry cook,
plating salads and desserts. The summer after 10th grade, he got
his first job on the line at the Fish Market at Lenox (the
precursor to the Atlanta Fish Market), preparing hot entrees. By
the summer after 12th grade, he graduated to the saute station _
the hardest one on the line.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip to New York, the family ate at Le Bernardin, a
French seafood restaurant that had taken America by storm. Young
Pano was ushered into the kitchen to meet the great chef Gilbert Le
Coze, now deceased. He saw the expanses of stainless steel, the
cadre of cooks and the immaculate seafood. And he knew that cooking
would be more than a summer job.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING UP
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   Pano Sr. says the successful restaurateur must live by his work
ethic and never forget he is a servant to his customers. So,
naturally, he did everything he could to dissuade his kids from the
restaurant business. He wanted better for them.
</P>
<P>
   Karatassos grew up in the back of his father's deli in Savannah,
a small grocery store with a short-order restaurant. The shelves
were perfectly stacked at all times, each can in its precise place.
The air was pungent with the competing odors of dried beans and
salt cod. Never comfortable in their adopted home, the parents
didn't allow their children out into the city, so young Pano and
his siblings stayed close to the store at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Karatassos could never please his severe father, also named
Pano. Even if he swept the sidewalk in front of the door he would
be upbraided for doing a poor job.
</P>
<P>
   The shop would one day belong to the son, as his father
constantly reminded him. Pulling his son by the ear, the father
would bring him to the counter and show him the key to the door.
``This key is waiting for you,'' he gravely reminded him in Greek.
The son nodded _ and at 17 left home to join the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A gig as ship's cook persuaded him to pursue a career at the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. For the next few
years, he cooked in resorts in the United States and Europe.
Although his career in food service was shaping up, his father gave
him no encouragement. When he returned to Savannah, the father
looked at his new clothes in contempt and huffed that he still had
a perfectly good suit that was 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days, before he made the jump from the kitchen to
the dining room, Karatassos worked for Klaus Fritsch, who later
founded the Morton's of Chicago restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be perfect with Pano,'' Fritsch recalls. ``He didn't
do anything halfway. There was no gray. It was black or white. Dead
or alive. Right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht, his former partner, agrees that Karatassos ``had a
European work ethic. He was very strict. He never let his guard
down for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one to delegate, Karatassos was involved in every decision
in the early days of the company. If he saw a waiter doing
something slightly wrong, Albrecht recalls, ``he'd correct it right
on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Karatassos' stature grew in the Atlanta restaurant community as
he opened one smash success after another. As the company expanded
throughout the 1980s, it moved away from the Continental
fine-dining model of Pano's and Paul's, 103 West and Capriccio (the
formal precursor to Pricci) and into the more casual terrain of the
Buckhead Diner and Atlanta Fish Market, the latter accompanied by a
65-foot sculpture of a leaping salmon that some equated to the size
of his ego.
</P>
<P>
   While Karatassos' detractors point out that his restaurants are
not original (wasn't the chrome fantasy of Buckhead Diner a clever
reworking of San Francisco's Fog City Diner?), he freely admits
that he shops for concepts and sits on them until he thinks Atlanta
is ready. ``I've always had a feeling how far you could take the
Atlanta market,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Karatassos has taken Atlanta further than anyone might
have imagined. Along the way he became active in charitable giving,
and under his leadership, Atlanta's chapter of Share Our Strength
raises more money to fight hunger than any in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the company's growth, Karatassos learned to
better control his legendary temper and to delegate more. ``My
father's had to change his managerial style,'' says Niko. ``His `my
way or the highway' approach didn't get the best results. He had to
learn to listen to people and support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Karatassos has never relaxed enough to sit down to a
meal at Pano's and Paul's. ``I couldn't do it. I'd keep thinking,
`What would my father say if he saw me sitting down with a napkin
tucked in my shirt?''' Though his father has been dead for more
than a decade, his ghost still hovers.
</P>
<P>
   And he has solidified a reputation in some quarters as a
ruthless competitor. Some former business associates refused to
discuss the dissolution of their dealings with him, or would do so
only off the record. Albrecht admits that their partnership
eventually went sour. ``When the business grew, I think things got
a little lopsided. The way we left it was a little rough. Attorneys
got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albrecht and everyone else agree on one thing: Karatassos
has always been a great father.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Pano Karatassos couldn't dissuade any of his kids
from going into the restaurant business. All three graduated from
the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International
University, and at their father's insistence, went to work at a
Fort Lauderdale branch of Houston's to learn the value of
consistency. Anne was the hostess, Niko the bartender and Pano a
line cook.
</P>
<P>
   And then they joined the family company.
</P>
<P>
   THE LINE CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   Anne went to work in the payroll department at Buckhead Life.
She married Peter Symbas, a physician, and earlier this month gave
birth to the family's first grandchild, a girl. Her name was
decided by family fiat. Several months before the baby's birth,
Niko said, ``We're going to name her Georgia, after my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Niko had plenty of back-of-the-house experience in the kitchen,
but his obvious aptness was in customer relations. So he worked
through the front of the house, landing as an assistant floor
manager at Pricci. At this glam-packed Italian restaurant, he
served the cream of Atlanta society and industry. Twice he rescued
choking customers with the Heimlich maneuver. One woman was
beginning to lose color when he spotted her. ``We had her food
replaced and she was eating again in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buckhead Life opened BluePointe, its most ambitious and
expensive contemporary restaurant to date, Niko was named general
manager. This may be his test: From the beginning he has been
besieged with complaints of overbooking and late seatings due to
the restaurant's enormous popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not the kind of manager to correct service on the
spot. When he heard a waiter telling a customer, ``You look like a
merlot drinker,'' he made a mental note. The next day he brought up
the issue at the daily service meeting, not to embarrass the waiter
but to encourage input. Together, the staff decided that servers
shouldn't stereotype customers.
</P>
<P>
   Pano Jr. spent a year in Atlanta after college cutting fish at
the Fish Market during the day and working on the line at 103 West
in the evening. But he wanted a grounding in classical French
stocks and sauces, and so he set off to the Culinary Institute of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pano Jr. graduated, his father, who was on the board of
the institute, flew up to join his son in a cooking demonstration.
It didn't go 100 percent well. Pano Jr. drove his father crazy with
his compulsive lining up of dish towels and utensils. Pano Sr.,
with his showman's personality, tried to take over. The event may
not have been a bonding time for father and son, but Pano Sr. left
thinking, ``I knew he had arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   After school, Pano Jr. married Angela King, the daughter of
Atlanta real estate developer and former Georgia Tech football hero
Kim King. Instead of returning to Atlanta, he set out to get the
best culinary education that money, ambition, determination and
intellectual curiosity could buy. He first returned to the place of
his epiphany, Le Bernardin, and spent a year and a half in this
``extremely intense'' four-star kitchen, working under chef Eric
Ripert. He worked every station in the kitchen. ``I learned how
seafood should be handled and produced. If Le Bernardin taught me
one thing, it was simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   After that he moved to another four-star New York restaurant,
Jean-Georges. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten created spontaneous
menus each morning, devising brilliant combinations of spice that
he expected the cooks to master with scant training for the lunch
service. ``It was a challenge working for him, trying to understand
his food,'' says Pano. ``We'd see him drinking his coffee and
writing his menu, and we just wanted to rip it out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Georges always said he wanted his food `sexy.' His
cooking is about glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity. Glamour. What could be next?
</P>
<P>
   THE RIGHT FIT
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pano Jr. flew to California to work for chef Thomas
Keller of the French Laundry. ``His philosophy and his kitchen was
exactly what I was after. There's a huge intermingling between the
cooks, and a communication in the kitchen built on organization and
doing things right. There's a huge desire to be the best. Every day
we ask how can we better ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French Laundry is all about finesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Pano Jr. talks candidly about his ``perfectionist'' nature.
Every day he puts out his clothes for the next. He keeps his car
perfect. He cannot bear the stress of rushing or looking for
things. Admittedly, he drives his wife crazy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also his philosophy of cooking and life. ``There's no
need to rush something you want to be good, whether in the
restaurant or my career. There's one right way to do everything. I
get it from my grandfather. But Dad, he's like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After the French Laundry, Pano Jr. is considering a move to
France to work in a Michelin three-star establishment, and his
father will wait and see. ``Sometimes I get concerned that Pano
will be in this bubble _ the Thomas Kellers, the Jean-Georgeses.
But when he's ready to have his restaurant, we're going to talk
through it. He wants to do his own thing and certainly will get the
support from me. And Niko will be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pano Jr. and Niko look forward to the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's my home,'' says Pano Jr. ``And I plan to be there
when this whole thing comes full circle.''

LET US NOW PRAISE BOOKS WELL SOLD BUT SELDOM READ 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By BILL GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tale of the emperor's new clothes has been around a long
time. But how about defining another category of mass delusion, the
emperor's new book: the insanely popular, often intellectually
intimidating book that sells hundreds of thousands of copies
(sometimes even millions) but that few people actually read?
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of the unread best seller comes to mind because
of the recent publication of ``Ravelstein,'' Saul Bellow's novel
about the life and death of his friend Allan Bloom. In life, Bloom
was a humanities professor well known only in the academy who
gained international fame in 1987 after the surprising success of
his dense treatise ``The Closing of the American Mind.'' To this
day, many consider it one of the prime examples of an emperor's new
book.
</P>
<P>
   Another classic example also comes from the 1980s: Stephen
Hawking's ``Brief History of Time'' remains no doubt the most
abstruse volume ever to sell nearly 9 million copies around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out which best sellers go unread is not easy, since
most people don't want to admit to the unfinished state of their
reading. Much of the evidence is anecdotal. Bloom and Hawking were
the universal first responses when a small sample of people in the
book business were asked about unread best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But a somewhat more solid indicator of unread books emerged in
1985 when Michael Kinsley, then of The New Republic, acted on his
suspicions about reading habits in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley and a colleague put coupons redeemable for $5 each in
the back of 70 copies of selected books in Washington bookstores.
Two of the books were ``Deadly Gambits: The Reagan Administration
and the Stalemate in Nuclear Arms Control'' by Strobe Talbott and
``The Good News Is the Bad News Is Wrong'' by Ben J. Wattenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither was a national best seller, they were chosen,
Kinsley said, as the kinds of books Washingtonians were most likely
to claim to have read. No one ever redeemed a coupon. The Kinsley
report may be as scientific a study as there is.
</P>
<P>
   The unread best seller seems to be a subject that makes many
people, and not just book buyers, uncomfortable. One New York
retailer at first said, ``We do regularly laugh about this,'' and
quickly named the latest Tom Wolfe novel, ``A Man in Full''
(``Everybody thought they had to have it'') and Harold Bloom's
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (``Everybody would like
to think they're going to read that much about Shakespeare, but
then they don't'') as two books she thought were more bought than
read.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately she decided not to be quoted by name. Still, she
did recount the story of a friend's husband who had ``actually read
the Hawking and then went around for a month trying to get a
conversation going about it _ but no one else had read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more forthright. Michael Willis was the marketing
director at the Free Press in 1994, when the company published
``The Bell Curve'' by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.``We
thought it was very much the case that both professionals and the
general public bought it to have it, and didn't read it,'' he said.
``We got the sense even from reviews that people basically read the
first chapter and the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cella is the manager of the Seminary Co-op Bookstore, a
cooperative bookstore near the University of Chicago that has
numbered both Allan Bloom and Bellow among its members. He suggests
that Seamus Heaney's ``Beowulf'' is a current example of the unread
best seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased but astounded by the number of copies we've
sold,'' he said. Has he read it? ``No, I haven't read it. But I did
buy it. I'm a prime example.'' Now that an audio version of the
poem, with Heaney reading his translation, has been released, Cella
said he plans to ``listen to it in the car'' on his summer
vacation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added, by the way, that ``The Closing of the American Mind''
was not only read by the Co-op buyers, many of whom knew Bloom, but
was also probably the fastest-selling book in the store's history _
until, of course, ``Ravelstein.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a long, unshameful history to the unread best seller,
according to Alberto Manguel, the author of``The History of
Reading.'' In citing classic examples, Manguel looks back a little
further than Heaney, Hawking and the Blooms to Venice in the 16th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The printer Aldus Manutius created what Manguel calls ``the most
beautiful books ever made.'' One of his greatest creations was a
series of ``exquisite little books that were the first pocket books
of the classics.'' Printed in Greek and Latin, they were published
when ``the ancients were read very much as contemporary, and the
discovery of a new essay by Cicero was as fashionable or as
interesting as Tom Wolfe.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the market, Manutius sized the books with the
``intention that they would be read by everybody.'' However, whole
series of his editions can be found today in what Manguel describes
as ``pristine condition.'' The aristocracy of the time, he said,
``would buy them and put them on the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   And not only the aristocracy. The 1535 ``Price List of the
Whores of Venice,'' a racy catalog that detailed the services each
woman would perform, includes, Manguel said, an entry for one
Lucrezia Squarcia, a prostitute who, according to the guide, was
``always with a pocket book of Petrarch, Virgil and sometimes even
Homer.''
</P>
<P>
   The price guide went on to say that Lucrezia only pretended to
love poetry. But in the desire to impress, perhaps there is a
little Lucrezia Squarcia in all of us.

<P>
   KARMEL, West Bank _ Rafat, a skinny 9-year-old too shy to supply
a surname, heads every summer morning to the only swimming hole in
this hardscrabble stretch of the Hebron hills. It is a stark stone
cistern, about 100 feet long and 50 feet across, built long ago to
store the rains that fall only in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Descending a rickety ladder, Rafat and his pals plunge happily
into stagnant water barely 3 feet deep, its surface an unbroken
carpet of brilliant green algae.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our children,'' said Khalil Yunis, mayor of the
nearby town of Yatta, shaking his head at the sight of the small
boys diving under the undulating scum. ``And this is their water.''
</P>
<P>
   The algae-choked pool where Rafat swims is the centerpiece of
the village water system. The other daily water source for Karmel's
3,500 residents is a tiny spring-fed brook that wends its way
through a herd of goats into a newly covered concrete cistern.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers carry pails past a hand-lettered sign in English
and Arabic extolling this modest public-works project,
``implemented by Yatta municipality'' and financed by the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless America,'' Yunis said with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yunis tried to help Karmel further by linking the village to
Yatta's municipal water system, but the summer supply in Yatta is
so low that water now flows through the 3-inch pipe here ``just two
or three days a month,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the West Bank, Yatta gets its water from Israel's
state water company. Disputes over water resources have been a fact
of life here since the land was occupied by Israel 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators now trying to
resolve the issue of water rights, along with all their other
hypercharged disputes _ about refugees, borders, Jerusalem _ the
concern in this parched part of the West Bank is that Israel may
end up retaining its hold on the reserves beneath the bedrock here.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile down the dirt road, Yunis pointed out what is to
him a symbol of the conflict that he hopes the Camp David talks can
resolve: a pristine pumping terminal, protected by a chain-link and
barbed-wire cage, for a large water main supplying a Jewish
settlement town, Maon.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller pipe once channeled some of this water to Karmel, but
the link was severed by settlers, Yunis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is right here, and we can't touch it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within plain view of the fenced-in pumping station, outside
another small village, Azam Abugadiah lowered two yellow pails into
a 30-foot well dug a year ago in another local-government effort to
expand water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Four times a day he expertly tips the buckets into the few
remaining inches of standing water, his family's only supply of
drinking water. Next to the nearly dry well, a new storage tank
stands empty, an electric pump is idle and the year-old water meter
shows a long row of zeros.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, water allocation is a zero-sum game, and
Palestinians consider local scarcity a direct and unjust
consequence of the resources given to Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   With their watered lawns and community pools, the 160,000 Jewish
settlers in the West Bank enjoy essentially the same suburban life
as Israelis elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlements, daily water consumption for households and
general urban use is about 74 gallons a person. That is not a lot
by American standards, but it is four times the Palestinian usage.
And during summer droughts, despite public-service calls to
conserve water, there is little real reduction in Israeli household
use. But among Palestinians, water supplies slow to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis make all this fuss about a shortage of water to
wash their cars, and we do not have enough to wash our bodies,''
said Muhammad Amro, an official with the Palestinian local
government ministry in the Hebron region.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says 26.5 gallons of potable water
per person is needed daily for minimal health and sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, where Palestinians control local
government but Israel still controls most of the water resources,
the average consumption is 18.5 gallons daily. In the summer in
towns like Yatta, with water systems connected to Israel's national
network, the supply dwindles to half that or less.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 215,000 Palestinians who live in villages with no
running water rely on trucked-in water bought in most cases from
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Lubell, a spokesman for Btselem, an Israeli human rights
group that brought European diplomats here for meetings with
officials of drought-stricken Palestinian towns, said the
settlements were just part of the problem. The drainage of aquifers
for Israeli industry and agriculture and the lack of serious
water-conservation efforts in Israel's affluent suburbs are the
real sources of the disparity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water issue is not one of the settlers vs. the
Palestinians, but of Israel vs. the Palestinians,'' said Lubell,
whose organization issued a study this month urging radical
cutbacks in Israel's use of underground fresh water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the inch-by-inch negotiating battle for territory here, the
lands that are bitterly disputed are precious and finite. But at
least they are not contracting. Subterranean water reserves, by
contrast, are steadily shrinking as the demands of two fast-growing
societies outpace natural replenishment by rivers and rainfall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As fresh water supplies diminish, brackish water from pools
deeper underground is drawn up into the depleted aquifers,
rendering the reserves undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israeli officials who favor increased allotments to the
Palestinians have argued for continued Israeli control of shared
aquifers beneath the hills here. Israel's acknowledged expertise in
water management can benefit both sides, they contend, and
hydraulics and topography make it easier to tap the main reservoir
from within Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians point to Israel's recent warnings that it
may unilaterally cut water supplies promised to Jordan under the
terms of its peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The one point of concurrence between Israeli and Palestinian
water experts is that the aquifers do not hold enough water to
supply both populations at present consumption rates for many more
years.
</P>
<P>
   While Palestinian villagers import Israeli water in tanker
trucks, Israel is seriously considering the emergency importation
of Turkish water in tanker ships, converted for the purpose from
the oil trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli experts deride that proposal as costly and
unsanitary, and say the farms that use most of the country's fresh
water should instead be irrigated with brackish and recycled waste
water.
</P>
<P>
   The only long-term solution, experts agree, is to create more
fresh water. Israel is seeking bids for gas-powered desalting
plants along the Mediterranean. The water-deprived Gaza Strip could
be the biggest beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   But in Karmel and other hamlets in the brown hills here, these
projects seem like a distant abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are discussing the problem of water for the next
generation,'' Amro said. ``But if we can't drink the water now,
there will be no next generation.''

COMMENTARY: `MEASURE OF JUSTICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last January I wrote about the case of Mary Anne
Gehris, a Georgia woman who came to this country from Germany as an
infant. She was facing deportation because she had pulled another
woman's hair.
</P>
<P>
   Gehris is not going to be deported after all. For her, that is
the end of a nightmare that had her living, as she put it, ``in
some kind of whirlwind.'' But the way it ended has a larger
meaning. Among other things, it should be a wake-up call to
Congress to amend the punitive provisions of immigration law that
cause such outrageous cases.
</P>
<P>
   The hair-pulling incident took place in 1988. Gehris was charged
with a misdemeanor, and on the advice of a public defender she
pleaded guilty. The judge gave her a one-year sentence, suspended
for a year's probation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Congress passed an Immigration Act that required
the deportation of any alien convicted of an ``aggravated felony.''
The act defined ``aggravated felony'' to include many misdemeanors,
some as trivial as Gehris'. And it made the provision retroactive:
covering things that took place before the statute was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The retroactive feature is what trapped Gehris. Ironically, she
herself brought her misdemeanor conviction to the attention of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, when she mentioned it in an
application to become a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   She was saved by the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.
Gehris' lawyer, Socheat Chea, asked the board to pardon her. Last
March it did so. That freed Gehris from the threat of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia board then did something more. It wrote a letter to
Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., asking him to do something about the 1996
Immigration Act. The letter was released to the public last week.
</P>
<P>
   The board does not usually consider pardons for misdemeanor
convictions, the letter said, because in Georgia they do not
deprive anyone of political rights. But it has had to start doing
so, it said, because the 1996 Immigration Act ``has adversely
affected the lives of numerous Georgia residents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen cases of applicants who have resided in the
United States for 30-plus years,'' the letter continued, ``who many
years ago committed a minor crime and are now being threatened with
deportation. These applicants include respected businessmen who
have small children and no family residing in the country of
origin.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter closed with a plea to Cleland. It would be
appreciated, the five board members wrote, if he worked ``to
provide a remedy which more appropriately uses the nation's
resources and brings some measure of justice to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have succeeded in applications to the board since then.
Two applicants were pardoned this week. Mary Gibbs, a grandmother,
was going to be deported for writing five bad checks in 1976, for a
total of around $100. Il Choi, a businessman, was on the verge of
being deported because he pleaded guilty to shoplifting a $39 item
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Other pardon applications are pending before the Georgia board.
One is for Jose Romero Rios, a paraplegic who hit his wife in 1993
and also got a year's sentence to be served on probation. The INS
wants to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Another application is for Olufolake Olaleye, a 38-year-old
mother of two children who are U.S. citizens. She was charged with
shoplifting in 1994. She said she was only trying to exchange a
child's dress, for which she had paid, for another size. But on the
advice of the prosecutor that it would do her no harm, she pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to a year to be served on probation. She
is under a deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia cases illustrate how cruel the 1996 act can be, and
how wasteful. Why should immigration authorities and pardon
officials and lawyers have to go through hoops to avoid the
consequences of an irrationally rigid law?
</P>
<P>
   Members of pardon and parole boards are not bleeding hearts.
They have seen enough wrongdoing and deceit to be skeptical. When
the Georgia board asks for changes so the Immigration Act ``more
appropriately uses the nation's resources and brings some measure
of justice,'' Congress should listen.

 &HT;    Eyes on Anderson
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Dallas Neil got plowed under by the ``Hit of
the day'' at Friday's first day of Falcons' camp. But it's Jamal
Anderson everybody wants to know about.
</P>
<P>
   The former All-Pro running back, out 14 games last season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, was slightly
limited while in pads for the first time since suffering the injury
Sept. 20 in a game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little bit of soreness,'' he said, ``but it's not the
tendinitis situation (that bothered him last month). So far, so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't get popped nearly as hard as Neil, the undrafted
rookie punter/tight end from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   But he made a mental note of the blast from linebacker Keith
Brooking that knocked him off his feet near the end of the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Up to then, Anderson had taken a few harmless knocks.
</P>
<P>
   After bouncing outside left on a running play in non-tackling
drills, he lowered his head and butted cornerback Ashley Ambrose
helmet-to-helmet.
</P>
<P>
   He barely had time to see Brooking coming.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage to Brooking.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year pro from Georgia Tech dropped his shoulders and
hit Anderson's right torso, sending the runner heels _ and knees _
over head.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went skidding out of bounds on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I was going to have a problem with Keith Brooking
and look what the guy did to me,'' Anderson said, smiling. ``But it
was fun to get back out here and get the pads cracking.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking said, ``He was giving his fair share of hits so I
figured I should get him back. Maybe he needed that little hit to
give him some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wants more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith caught me from on the side, which is cool because those
hits you don't see until the last second . . . are the ones that
will prepare your knee,'' he said. ``You don't know, will it buckle
or will it hold up? Today it held up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Dan Reeves, who has vowed this would be a more physical
training camp than last, was smiling. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day was extremely good,'' he said. ``Jamal looked
good and I think that made all of us feel a lot better. I saw him
take some licks and he was cutting. The fact he was able to do it
without any pain is a huge improvement over a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit the blocking sled just once and didn't participate
in fumble drills or conditioning. He'll participate in one of
today's two practices.
</P>
<P>
   Neil will be available for both. For a few seconds Friday, that
was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After catching a pass, he turned toward the left sideline and
headed upfield. He never saw reserve safety Gerald McBurrows coming
full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Neil _ who months ago sent a self-promotional package to teams
with a mannequin's leg and a note saying, ``I'd give my left leg to
play for you'' _ nearly lost a couple limbs. ``I guess that was my
wake-up call to the NFL,'' Neil said. ``You got to get up; you
can't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the play, the undrafted rookie jogged to the huddle and
patted McBurrows on the rear, ``to let `em know I'm coming back,''
he said. One problem: It was defensive end Emil Ekiyor.

DEATH PENALTY LIVES ON AS THORN IN BUSH'S SIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ The execution of Gary Graham haunted
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush Friday, as
anti-death penalty hecklers interrupted one of his speeches and a
guest at a community center event accused him of acting politically
instead of morally.
</P>
<P>
   While anti-death penalty pressure on the Texas governor faded
rapidly two years ago after the execution of pickax murderer Karla
Faye Tucker, the protests over Graham's execution last month have
marred several of Bush's events this week.
</P>
<P>
   Four protesters were removed from Bush's speech to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People convention on
Monday. Two more were ejected Friday as Bush spoke to a
Conservative Party fund-raiser in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop the racist death penalty!'' the pair shouted, waving
posters bearing Graham's picture before being forcibly ejected from
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about America is a man gets to express his
opinion,'' Bush told the crowd after the protesters were thrown
out. ``I don't have to take polls or focus groups to determine my
job should be to uphold the laws of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, as Bush promoted faith-based social services
at the Elizabethport Presbyterian Center, the Rev. Joseph Garlic
lectured Bush on the fairness of the justice system for blacks.
Garlic said Bush should have stopped Graham's execution last month
because of doubts about Graham's guilt in a 1981 Houston murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talked this morning about love and giving people an
opportunity, and I think the doubt that surrounded the case of Gary
Graham gave you an opportunity to show some compassion and love in
a way that had not been shown,'' Garlic said.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, who is black, said Bush tried to show earlier this week
that he was a different kind of Republican by talking to the NAACP.
But he said Bush also should have been aware that justice sometimes
is unequal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read somewhere where you said you trusted the criminal
justice system. At the same time, I think you are aware,
particularly as it relates to black people, justice has not always
been fair,'' Garlic said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his actions in the Graham case, saying he believes
the death penalty saves lives through deterrence and that it is his
job to carry out the laws of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said. ``It's not an easy
decision to make . . . This is not a political decision for me,
reverend. If it costs me votes, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garlic responded that Bush had acted politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a political decision, because there are other ways to
punish criminals other than the death penalty,'' Garlic said.
``While you say it was not a political decision, it definitely was
not a moral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush cut Garlic off by saying the pair simply disagree.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Elizabethport center, Bush proposed a program to
give $400 million in vouchers to help low-income parents defray the
cost of putting their children into after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's home state, the Texas Education Agency awarded $10.6
million to 71 school districts last November for programs designed
to keep middle-school children out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In January, it awarded another $85 million to be divided among
234 school districts for programs aimed at preventing freshmen from
dropping out of high school. Although districts were not required
to use that money for after-school programs, some did.
</P>
<P>
   Most after-school programs are funded at the local level, said
TEA spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush had breakfast with New York Gov. George
Pataki at the airport Hilton in Newark, N.J. Aides confirmed the
two discussed Pataki's chances of becoming Bush's running mate.
They have been friends since attending Yale University together in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservative politics are going to work for
America when Governor Bush becomes president,'' Pataki later told
the New York Conservative Party while introducing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Pataki as a friend but never hinted to the crowd
that he might be under consideration as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also praised U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, the New York GOP nominee
for U.S. Senate. Bush poked fun at Lazio's Democratic opponent,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, for not being a native New
Yorker.

SENATE VOTES TO REPEAL ESTATE TAX; CLINTON PROMISES VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Texas, N.D., Okla.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Friday to repeal the federal
estate tax, brushing aside a veto threat from President Clinton and
giving Republicans at least a symbolic victory on an issue at the
top of their election-year agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 59-39. Although Democrats have long said repeal of
the tax would be a hugely expensive giveaway to the rich, nine of
45 Democrats voted in favor of the legislation, reflecting the
shifting politics of taxation at a time of widespread prosperity
and growing federal budget surpluses. Four Republicans voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed identical legislation last month. Republican
leaders said they would send the measure to the White House
promptly and use Clinton's promised veto _ which the vote Friday
suggested Senate supporters of the bill would be unable to override
_ to support their case that voters will not get tax cuts until a
Republican becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the apparent Republican presidential
nominee, supports elimination of the estate tax. His Democratic
rival, Vice President Al Gore, backs a far smaller reduction in it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans presented the legislation, which would phase out the
tax over the next decade, largely as an effort to help families
pass farms and small businesses from one generation to another.
Heirs are sometimes forced by the tax to sell part or all of the
estate to pay the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   But even under current law, the tax is levied on only a tiny
proportion of estates, those worth more than $675,000, or $1.3
million in the case of family-owned farms and businesses. And in
calling for full repeal of the tax for all types of estates, the
bill's supporters had in mind some of their wealthiest constituents
as well as the growing ranks of voters who have seen their net
worth surge as the strong economy drives up the value of their
homes and their holdings of stock and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the tax was inherently unfair, no matter who
paid it, arguing that there was no justification for the government
to use death to make a claim on wealth amassed over a lifetime.
They conjured images of the government's reaching into the grave to
seize property and said that nothing less than abolishing the tax
was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cancer,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said after the
vote. ``It's wrong. We want to get rid of it totally.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they favored exempting family-owned farms and
small businesses from the estate tax, and offered their own plan to
do so. But they said the Republican plan, in going much further,
amounted to a tax break worth hundreds of billions of dollars in
coming decades to a tiny slice of extremely rich people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Democrats said during the three days of debate that
led up to Friday's vote, the money that would go to the estate tax
repeal could be better used to address issues of more pressing
concern to all Americans. They cited Democratic goals including the
addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare and the
enactment of tax breaks for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal they offer is one that would give hundreds of
billions of dollars to the largest estates in America,'' Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., said of the Republican legislation. ``Is that the
priority? It is for them. It's not for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Clinton called the legislation ``a
budget-busting bill that provides a huge tax cut for the most
well-off Americans at the expense of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Charitable contributions are a common way for the wealthy to
reduce their projected estate tax liability, and Clinton warned
that repeal of the tax could also cut charitable donations by $5
billion to $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this bill comes to my desk,'' he said, ``I will veto
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would phase out the federal estate and gift tax _ what
Republicans call the ``death tax'' _ in small steps over the next
10 years, with most of the tax disappearing only at the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the amount of tax exemption for estates in
general is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006 from its
current level of $675,000; the $1.3 million exemption for family
farms and small businesses is already in effect. Above those
limits, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of
55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would start by eliminating a 5 percent surcharge on
some estates next year and by reducing the top rate to 50 percent
from 55 percent in 2002. Starting in 2003, it would begin reducing
all estate-tax rates by 1 to 2 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would be repealed entirely in 2010, at which point the
bill would bring changes in the way taxes are assessed on stocks,
real estate and other assets held by an estate.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, gains in the value of assets held by the estate
would be taxed at capital gains rates starting in 2010 rather than
at estate-tax rates. The bill would allow surviving spouses to
avoid capital gains taxes on $3 million in assets, and in some
cases on up to $4.3 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would reduce federal revenue by $104 billion over
the first 10 years and by $750 billion in the second 10 years,
according to the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the existing exemptions, the tax is levied on
relatively few estates _ an estimated 48,000 this year, or about 2
percent of all deaths. And the bulk of the tax is paid by a
relatively small proportion of the estates that do get taxed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the Treasury Department, 22 percent of total
federal estate tax revenue in 1998 _ $4.4 billion of $20.3 billion
_ came from just 374 estates valued at more than $20 million each.
More than half of estate tax revenue in that year came from just
2,898 estates valued at $5 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate rejected an alternative offered by
Democrats that would have substantially raised the exemption for
all estates _ and even more so for family-owned farms and small
businesses, effectively freeing nearly all of them from the tax.
The vote against the Democratic alternative was 53-46.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties said there was a slim possibility
of a compromise later this year as part of a bigger bipartisan deal
on tax and spending legislation. But Republican leaders showed no
public willingness Friday to consider taking what the Democrats had
offered.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Democratic plan would be subject to IRS rules so
complex that few family-owned farms and businesses would be able to
take advantage of it. If even a scaled-down version of the tax was
left on the books, Republicans said, Democrats would press to
broaden its reach again as soon as they got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats offered a fig leaf,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., his party's whip.
</P>
<P>
   In debating the bill, the Senate had adopted a number of
tax-cutting amendments, including a repeal of the 3 percent federal
excise tax on telephone service and the permanent extension of a
corporate tax credit for research and experimentation costs.
</P>
<P>
   But under orders from the Republican leadership, the Senate then
voted Friday to strip out all the amendments, intent on sending
Clinton _ and voters _ an undiluted message about the majority's
position on the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate Friday put on display the continuing deep
differences between the parties over tax cuts, it also demonstrated
that Democrats had become more willing to champion tax cuts of
their own, although at substantially lower levels than sought by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it illustrated the breach in the Democratic ranks
over the estate tax, an issue that the party long considered of
interest only to a tiny sliver of very wealthy people and the tax
lawyers and accountants who make a living by developing estate
plans that help the rich escape the full brunt of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who voted for the bill were Sens. John Breaux of
Louisiana, Max Cleland of Georgia, Dianne Feinstein of California,
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Patty
Murray of Washington, Charles Robb of Virginia, Robert Torricelli
of New Jersey and Ron Wyden of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans opposed were Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island,
James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and George
Voinovich of Ohio. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the Democrats who voted for the bill are Southerners
regularly to the right of their party. Another of them, Robb, faces
a tough re-election race this year and did not want to give the
Republicans ammunition to portray him as against tax cuts. Still
others come from states with some combination of high real estate
prices, large numbers of successful technology entrepreneurs and
significant numbers of family-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate tax is a wildly clumsy, inefficient tax that
basically is a full-employment program for lawyers and
accountants,'' Wyden said. ``We ought to be phasing out the estate
tax, and we should work toward a tax code that is both progressive
and entrepreneur-friendly.''

ADVISORY JURY FINDS GOVERNMENT NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAVIDIANS DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
And BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A five-member advisory on Friday jury cleared
federal agents of any wrongdoing in the fiery deaths of some 80
Branch Davidians near Waco, a decision that government attorneys
said should end a 7-year-old controversy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. is expected to issue the
final verdict next month in the $675 million wrongful death
lawsuit, but the lead attorney for the Davidians indicated that he
may be finished with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be resolved is whether FBI agents fired into the sect
headquarters on April 19, 1993, the day the 51-day standoff ended
in a fatal fire. Smith has tentatively set Aug. 2 to hear
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for 2 1/2 hours on Friday before issuing
its finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is vindication for the law-enforcement officers
who were out at Mount Carmel doing their jobs under very difficult
circumstances, very dangerous circumstances,'' said U.S. Attorney
Michael Bradford, who represented the government in the month-long
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the decision proves that sect leader David Koresh
and the Davidians were responsible for the April 19, 1993, tragedy
at Mount Carmel, the name of the sect's complex about 10 miles
outside of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, lead attorney for the Davidians and their
families, said he has spent more than a million dollars on the case
and may drop the allegation against the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in pursuing lost causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions from survivors and relatives of the Davidians killed
at Mount Carmel included disappointment, bitterness and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it wasn't a fair trial. I said that before it
started,'' said Clive Doyle, 59, an Australian-born Davidian who
escaped from the fire, with burns. His 18-year-old daughter was
among those who died.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle described his reaction to the decision as ``ho-hum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been surprised if the jury and the judge had
ruled in our favor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his efforts to make new evidence against the government
public, Caddell said he fears that the focus will be solely on the
jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of the American people will take
this as the final word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell predicted that the jury's decision might influence
former Sen. John Danforth's independent investigation of the events
at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Danforth, who was appointed in September by
Attorney General Janet Reno, told The Associated Press that he
would not comment on the jury's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys James Brannon of Houston and former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark joined Caddell in trying to prove that 75 agents from
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fired indiscriminately
in a gun battle that broke out when they tried to serve a search
warrant at Mount Carmel on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Brannon and Clark left without comment.
</P>
<P>
   The raid left four ATF agents and six Davidians dead.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, during closing arguments, pointed to testimony from some
of the ATF agents, saying they fired at windows from where they
believed the shots were coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't see anybody; they just shot,'' Clark said. ``If
that's not indiscriminate, what is indiscriminate?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plaintiffs' closing argument appealed to the jurors'
emotions. Clark described sect members as peaceful church people;
Brannon showed photographs of three babies killed in the fire; and
Caddell read aloud part of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury found that ATF did not act inappropriately and that
the FBI, which took over after the botched raid, was not negligent
April 19. Smith asked the jury to determine whether the FBI was
negligent in any of three ways: by using tanks to destroy part of
the sect's building; by starting or contributing to a fire that
raced through it; and by failing to have a firefighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of about 80 Branch Davidians were found
after the fire was doused, although the actual number remains in
dispute. Autopsies, some of which were performed by Tarrant County
Medical Examiner Nizam Peerwani, show that the majority died by
smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen died of gunshot wounds consistent with suicide and a
few suffocated or died of blunt trauma, the reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the government never presented testimony to counter
the Davidians' fire investigation expert, Pat Kennedy, who said the
government helped at least spread the fire by using tanks to insert
tear gas directly into the sect's living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you destroy a building, you make kindling,'' Caddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government presented secretly-recorded tapes from April 19
that voice engineers said captured Davidians discussing their
efforts to spread fuel and then light a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, David Koresh and the Branch Davidians were responsible
for that tragedy, as well,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvelyn Cooney, 48, whose sister Jaydean Wendel was fatally
shot during the initial raid as she combed her child's hair,
praised the jury and the Davidians' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the verdict could have been different, but I admire
everyone who tried to bring justice,'' Cooney said from Spokane,
Wash., where she cares for her sister's four children.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the jurors, whose names were not made public, did
not want to be interviewed by attorneys or news agencies. They left
the courthouse before the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he couldn't say why the jury wasn't persuaded. He
said jurors may have been unsettled by the Davidians' firepower,
which included automatic weapons, grenades, grenade launchers and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``for some people, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to believe that anyone with law enforcement would not
be completely truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also said that the judge's instructions to the jury
omitted key information, such as what responsibility the government
bore in foreseeing the tragedy and what duty it had to avert the
suicide of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would eat my shoe,'' Smith responded, if the instructions
didn't reflect the issues in the case.

   DRAGUIGNAN, France _ A quick Tour de France trivia question:
When was the last time that the rider who wore the overall leader's
yellow jersey failed to pick up a single stage victory on his way
to the finish line in Paris? American Greg LeMond is the last
champion to own that distinction of no stage wins. He never stood
on the stage winner's podium back in 1990, yet he beat Italy's
Claudio Chiapucci by 2 minutes, 16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If Austin's Lance Armstrong maintains his ways this year, he'll
join LeMond.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has four second-place finishes through 13 stages of
this year's Tour, yet he also owns a dominating 4 minute and 55
second lead over German Jan Ullrich, the only rider who holds any
hope of catching the American.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, most of the yellow jersey contenders were content to
allow the French riders, some of whom sported blue, white and red
wheels and spokes, to take the spotlight on Bastille Day, France's
national day of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished in the peloton, the main group of riders, as
the cyclists cut through Provence and toward the Alps. He was 27th,
10:06 behind stage victor Vicente Garcia-Acosta. Ullrich, the 1997
Tour champion, finished with the same time as Armstrong, but was
22nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is not out to win stages right now,'' said Chris
Carmichael, Armstrong's long-time private coach. ``He rode today to
stay out of trouble. He really just needed to be safe. He's not
focused on the daily battles, he's focused on winning the entire
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong described Friday's stage as very stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ''These stages in between the mountains are really hard,''
Armstrong said. ''They're difficult. They're not really flat like
the first week. They're rolling and everybody is moving at a faster
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, this thing is far from over. Tomorrow (today) is the
largest and longest stage. We'll see where we are Sunday night. The
next two days are critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was closely guarded by his U.S. Postal Service
teammates, who formed a shield in front of him for much of the
afternoon. U.S. Postal was one of only five teams still with a full
contingent of nine riders. To celebrate Bastille Day, Cedric
Vasseur, the lone Frenchmen on the American team, was the first
Postal rider to cross the finish line. He was 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Acosta, a Spaniard riding for Team Banesto, spoiled the
French riders' collective attempts at glory on this national
holiday by riding alone for the final seven miles of the stage.
Like all other stage winners, he pumped his fist in the air and
waved to the throngs who lined the route.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchmen Nicolas Jalabert was second, 25 seconds behind. Like
his more famous brother, Laurent, he rides for the Spanish team
ONCE. Pascal Herve, another Frenchman, was third.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will be one of the favorites to take today's long
stage, which winds from Draguignan to Briancon. The 154.7-mile trek
features three high mountain climbs and will favor riders such as
Armstrong and Marco Pantani, the Italian who won Thursday's stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, the 1998 Tour champion, still was 13th in the overall
standings, 10:26 behind Armstrong. But his victory Thursday made
him an even more popular figure with the Italian media, who swarmed
him before Friday's stage. With today's route coming so close to
Italy, Pantani likely will have more of a home-country advantage
than the French riders.
</P>
<P>
   After today, the riders must endure another mountain stage, with
Sunday's ending at the 6,000-foot summit in Courchevel. Monday is
the Tour's last off day, with the remaining stages gradually
returning to flatter routes before the race concludes in Paris on
July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said he was ``absolutely'' confident that Armstrong
would maintain his lead through the weekend. But he still remained
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race is not over _ a lot of things can keep Lance
Armstrong from winning the Tour de France, but I'm not saying he
won't win it,'' he said.

JURY FINDS U.S. OFFICIALS NOT LIABLE IN DEATHS OF BRANCH
DAVIDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In a striking victory for the government, an
advisory panel of five jurors took just over an hour Friday to find
that federal officials were not liable in the deaths of nearly 80
Branch Davidians who were killed with four government agents in the
1993 raid and standoff at the sect's compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials portrayed the jury's finding as a vindication
for them in an episode that provided one of the darkest chapters in
the history of federal law enforcement, threatened the career of
Attorney General Janet Reno and continues to generate criticism.
The lawsuit itself represents a six-year legal struggle that
ultimately became a highly publicized test of the government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This terrible tragedy was the responsibility of David Koresh
and the Branch Davidians, not the federal government,'' the Justice
Department said in a terse statement. ``We are pleased the jury
affirmed that view.''
</P>
<P>
   The swift verdict, which came after a month of testimony, may
not be the final word on the case, however.
</P>
<P>
   Walter S. Smith, the federal judge presiding, will ultimately
decide the outcome of the wrongful-death suit. Earlier Friday,
before the jury was seated, Smith reminded lawyers involved that
``It's important for everyone to understand that their decision is
in no way binding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to consider the advice of the jury, but by law I
cannot be bound by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows for advisory panels in cases in which the
government is being sued, said Smith, who limited the jury's role
in the suit to this advisory capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will not make his ruling until at least August, after he
has heard another part of the case dealing with whether federal
agents fired into the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel compound as it
was consumed by flames on April 19, 1993. That issue will be
decided by him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and relatives of Branch Davidians killed during the
siege had sought $675 million, accusing the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms of using excessive force and firing
indiscriminately during the initial Feb. 28, 1993, raid to arrest
Koresh, the sect leader, on weapons violations. Six Branch
Davidians, as well as the four agents of the bureau, were killed
that day in the beginning of a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   They also claimed that commanders on the scene for the FBI at
the April 19 fire had exceeded their authority while implementing a
Washington-approved plan to use tanks to inject tear gas into the
compound, ultimately causing the fire in which about 75 people,
including 20 children, died. The government was also negligent,
they had claimed, for not having adequate equipment on hand to
fight that fire.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers had argued that the Branch Davidians ambushed
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents involved in the initial raid
and set the final, devastating fire themselves as part of a suicide
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments from both sides in the case, delivered earlier
Friday, were steeped in emotional outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing about this trial is that there will be
another David Koresh. This case is about the children. It's too
late to save the children of Mount Carmel. What you do here will
determine what happens to those next children,'' the plaintiffs'
lead lawyer, Michael Caddell, told jurors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had attempted to fix blame for the raid, standoff and
fire squarely on the shoulders of those who planned the operations,
but spoke glowingly to the jury of the ``brave men'' of the
government who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men under that kind of pressure make mistakes,'' he said.
``It's not their fault. They were placed in an impossible position.
They didn't give the orders. They didn't make the plans.''
</P>
<P>
   During his final argument to the jury, J. Michael Bradford, the
U.S. attorney representing the government, called the events at
Mount Carmel ``a terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of those children it makes me mad and angry.
Those children should be alive today, would be alive, but for the
actions of a man who thought he was Jesus Christ,'' he said,
referring to Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be shocked and outraged by the conduct of David
Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Instead, we have this lawsuit that
seeks to validate their actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his charge to the jury, Smith had listed four questions that
jurors should answer in assigning blame:
</P>
<P>
   Did the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms use excessive
force and fire indiscriminately during the initial raid? Did FBI
agents act negligently, going beyond their orders, in their use of
tanks during the final assault on the compound? Did those tanks
cause the April 19 fire, and were FBI commanders negligent in their
decision not to have firefighting equipment available on the scene
that day?
</P>
<P>
   As federal protections grant wide latitude for agents pursuing
official duties, Smith said, if jurors answered no to the first two
questions, there was no reason to answer the last two.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, jurors got no further than the first two questions,
the judge said. The decision of the panel was unanimous, and the
jurors did not want to speak to reporters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he thought the jury was likely swayed by ``all the
guns'' the sect kept at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that quantity of weaponry this close to Waco was too
much for them,'' he said of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would appeal the verdict, Caddell hesitated and
said, ``As a a practical matter, when you get a verdict, it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's lawyer, Bradford, said he believed the verdict
vindicated the actions of the government agents who, he said,
``faced a very dangerous group of people in a very difficult
circumstance in 1993 in trying to carry out their job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This verdict shows the responsibility for this tragedy is with
David Koresh and the Branch Davidians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said, ``The significance of the jury's
findings to the courageous federal law enforcement officers who
have had to absorb unproven allegations and public criticisms for
all those years cannot be overstated. An enormous burden has been
lifted from them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in the case were delayed Friday morning while Smith
responded to accusations made Thursday by Caddell that the judge
was trying to ``engineer a verdict'' through the four-part
questionnaires he had prepared for the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to set the record straight. I have not in any way tried
to engineer a jury charge. I have tried to simplify the issues for
this jury,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those involved in the case said Smith's narrow jury
charge, and limitations he placed on evidence admissible during the
trial, may have kept jurors and the public from getting all of the
relevant facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly, terribly frustrated by the way this case has
gone,'' said former attorney general Ramsey Clark, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, before the jury reached its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a negligence case, it's a constitutional case. How
do you drive a tank into a church dozens of times and then call it
negligence? The government has made the victims into the
violators,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And David Thibodeau, a Branch Davidian who survived the fire,
also expressed frustration at the narrow focus of the evidence
presented during the trial. ``It's outrageous that after two
congressional hearings and the criminal trial they are still
limiting what the public knows about this case. It'll be another 20
years before we find out what really happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still an ongoing investigation of the Waco events being
conducted by a special counsel, former Sen. John Danforth,
appointed by Reno last September. It is not known when he will make
his final report.
</P>
<P>
   But Caddell said that for many people, Friday's verdict may be
the end of lingering public questions about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of the American people will take
this as the last word. What they will take away is that five people
sat on a jury and decided that the government was not negligent,
and that will be the end of it,'' Caddell said.

   Napster, the wildly popular software that allows users to trade
music over the Internet, could be shut down later this month if the
Recording Industry Association of America gets an injunction it is
seeking in federal court in California. The big record companies in
the association _ along with the angry artists who testified before
the Senate Judiciary Committee this week _ maintain that Napster is
nothing more than a tool for digital piracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster and the MP3 technology it exploits have changed the
music business no matter how the lawsuit comes out. Despite all the
fuss about copyright and legality, the most important freedom
Napster has spread across the music world is not freedom from cost,
but freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, by linking music lovers and letting them share their
collections, lets them select from a boundless range of music, one
song at a time. This is a huge change from the way the music
industry currently does business, and even if Napster Inc.
disappears, it won't be easy to persuade customers to go back to
getting their music as the music industry has long packaged it.
</P>
<P>
   Most albums have only two or three songs that any given listener
likes, but the album format forces people to choose between paying
for a dozen mediocre songs to get those two or three, or not
getting any of the songs at all. This all-or-nothing approach has
resulted in music collections that are the barest approximation of
a listener's actual tastes. Even CD ``singles'' have been turned
into multi-track mini-albums almost as expensive as the real thing,
and though there have been some commercial ``mix your own CD''
experiments in recent years, they foundered because major labels
wouldn't allow access to their collections a song at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has demonstrated that there are no technological
barriers to gaining access to the world's music catalogue, just
commercial ones. Napster users aren't merely cherry-picking the
hits off well-known albums. Listeners are indulging all their
contradictory interests, constantly updating their playlists with a
little Bach, a little Beck or a little Buckwheat Zydeco, as the
mood strikes them. Because it knows nothing of genre, a Napster
search produces a cornucopia of alternate versions: Hank Williams'
``I'm So Lonesome I Could Die'' as interpreted by both Dean Martin
and the Cowboy Junkies, or two dozen covers of ``Louie Louie.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster has become a tool for musical adventure, producing more
diversity by accident than the world music section of the local
record store does by design: a simple search for the word ``water''
brings up Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over Troubled Water,''
Deep Purple's ``Smoke on the Water,'' ``Cool Water'' by the Sons of
the Pioneers and ``Water No Get Enemy'' by Fela Anikulapo Kuti.
After experiencing this freedom, music lovers are not going to go
happily back to buying albums.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains of how artists will be paid when songs are
downloaded over the Internet, and there are many sources of revenue
being bandied about _ advertising, sponsorship, user subscription,
pay-per-song. But merely recreating the CD in cyberspace will not
work.
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of Prohibition, Napster users have shown that they
are willing to break the law to escape the constraints of
all-or-nothing musical choices. This won't be changed by shutting
down Napster. The music industry is going to have to find some way
to indulge its customers in their newfound freedom. &QL;

JURY SAYS TOBACCO INDUSTRY MUST PAY $144.8 BILLION IN CLASS-ACTION
SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the largest damage award in U.S. history, a jury in
Miami-Dade County on Friday ordered the tobacco industry to pay
$144.8 billion in punitive damages to some 500,000 sick Florida
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some of the sick smokers and the widows and widowers
of others celebrated the verdict as a sweeping victory over the
industry, tobacco executives called the award ridiculous, and one
that would push the companies into bankruptcy, if it is ever paid
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The companies vowed to appeal, a process that could take years.
While those appeals are underway, their financial exposure could be
relatively minimal. Under a law passed last year with this case in
mind, cigarette makers could be required to post an initial bond of
no more than $100 million per company. A judge may decide as soon
as Monday whether that law applies in this case, since the suit was
filed before the law was passed. In addition, Florida law prohibits
a damage award that would force a company into bankruptcy. Experts
on both sides debated whether such a massive judgment would put the
companies out of business. ``There is no industry in America,
there's probably not a country in the world, that could withstand a
verdict of this size,'' said Dan Webb, a lawyer for Philip Morris,
the country's largest cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury, which has weighed the different phases of
this case for two years now, deliberated only five hours before
reaching its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of zeros,'' said Judge Robert Kaye, as he read the amount
of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Saa, who has had his vocal chords and much of his
throat removed because of smoking-related cancer, became so
emotional after the verdict was read that he had difficulty
breathing, and had to leave the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how happy I am,'' said Saa, one of the
plaintiffs, speaking through an electronic voice box. ``My heart is
happy, because this is a lesson for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the massive verdict was an
appropriate punishment for an industry that makes a product that
kills 430,000 Americans every year and for misleading the public
about the dangers even after medical research showed that smoking
causes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye can reduce the amount, but lawyers for the industry are
likely to appeal any award approaching the billions the jury voted
for.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the five companies had said in closing arguments
that such a verdict would be a ``death warrant'' for the industry.
But after the jury's decision, the companies' lawyers said instead
that the judgment would have no immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased, because there is no practical impact on Philip
Morris,'' said Webb.
</P>
<P>
   He called the verdict ``an unfair procedure, unheard of in
American history,'' but one that would not stand up under an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a verdict in favor of no one,'' said Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris was ordered to pay $73.96 billion, R.J. Reynolds
$36.28 billion, Brown &AMP; Williamson $17.59 billion, Lorillard
Tobacco $16.25 billion, and Liggett Group Inc. $790 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire industry could not even pay that amount,'' said Dan
Donahue, senior vice president at R.J. Reynolds, of the judgment
against his company. ``It's a ridiculous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the $144.8 billion judgment was to be paid by
the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute, which
had provided false data that refuted medical research of the
dangers of smoking.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sick smokers, some of whom have followed the case every day from
the courtroom pews, were optimistic about the outcome. The same
jury had found in July 1999 that the tobacco industry manufactured
a deadly product, and that it had deceived the public for years. In
April, the panel ordered cigarette makers to pay $12.7 million in
compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the jury heard 157 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the punitive stage of the trial, sick smokers first asked for
$196 billion in damages. But the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs,
Stanley Rosenblatt, would eventually suggest an award of $154
billion to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day of reckoning,'' said Rosenblatt. ``This was never
about money. This was about showing these companies up for what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said the jury, which was made up of a postal worker,
a bank teller, a welder, a telephone technician, an assistant
principal and another school employee, ``did the right thing. They
said to those companies, `Cut it out. Tell us the truth.' They were
stoic, unemotional.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter in the case from now on, said Frank Amodeo, one of
three sick smokers who legally represents the 500,000 others in the
class-action lawsuit, the jury's verdict is the most significant
victory so far in a fight to make the companies acknowledge their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Amodeo contracted throat cancer about 10 years ago, cannot
swallow and must be fed through a tube. ``There is no amount of
money in the world that will change the way I eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was history making in other ways. Top executives for
the companies, who rarely testify under oath, took the stand to say
that their companies had changed, that they were spending millions
to discourage underage smoking and were repentant of the way
business was done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the companies had said the cigarette makers could
afford to pay between $150 million to $375 million, but would be
put out of business if the jury granted anything approaching the
requested award.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either destroy them or you don't,'' said Gordon Smith, a
lawyer for Brown &AMP; Williamson, in his closing argument. ``Your
verdict must reflect current ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of punitive judgment the industry said it could
afford to pay represents a fraction of its audited net worth, and
could be recouped in just a few days of wholesale cigarette sales,
said critics of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask you to speak for all those silent, anonymous victims of
tobacco grieved by their loved ones but unknown to a callous and
deceitful industry,'' Rosenblatt said in his closing argument.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eclipsed the punitive damage award of $5 billion
against ExxonMobil for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and a
$4.8 billion award against General Motors in a car fire in
California _ a judge later reduced that award to $1.09 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the largest award of any kind, much more than
the $22 billion awarded in Hawaii in 1996 to a treasure hunter who
sued former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines for an
alleged theft of gold bullion. That verdict was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, a former Wall Street executive who formed Smokefree
Educational Services, had testified for the plaintiffs on the
industry's ability to pay in the event of such a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Turner does not believe the plaintiffs will ever see any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, the guilty people don't always have to pay,''
he said. ``They were found guilty of lying, killing, causing
diseases. But the tobacco cartel has friends in high places. They
own Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The award, he said, ``will never amount to a hill of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message, he said, will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These six ordinary people,'' he said, ``have decided this
industry is guilty of the biggest fraud, deceit, maiming, killing,
destroying and lying in the history of mankind. Nothing will ever
change that fact.''

IN THE `GREENED' WORLD, IT ISN'T EASY TO BE HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By ALEXANDER STILLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be wrong with saving a rain forest? Quite a bit, say
a number of anthropologists who have become increasingly critical
of what they call ``green imperialism.'' Portraying
environmentalists as latter-day missionaries of a new universal
truth, many see Third World conservation as a form of
neocolonialism, the latest attempt by wealthy Westerners to move
into poor tropical countries and tell the local residents what they
should and should not do with their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmentalists are trying to save landscapes from the
people who live in them,'' said Simone Dreyfus, a French
anthropologist who contributed to a recent volume called ``Nature
Sauvage, Nature Sauvee'' (``Wild Nature, Saved Nature''). ``Many of
them seem to care more about animals and plants than about people.
Too often, efforts to save the environment are being imposed from
the outside and not from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the term ``biodiversity'' was coined as recently as the
1970s, it caught on so quickly that by the 1980s preserving species
had become an important part of American foreign policy. The State
Department, the World Bank and other purveyors of aid often made
the creation of national parks a condition of receiving it. The
policy has paid off: Environmentalists have succeeded in protecting
an area altogether the size of China, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But these efforts have come at considerable human cost, the
critical anthropologists say. Approximately 70 percent of the
protected areas are inhabited by Homo sapiens as well as other
species. Between 1986 and 1996, about 3 million people were forced
to move as a result of both development and conservation projects,
according to World Bank statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt has generally been borne by extremely poor indigenous
people. ``I'd like to see what would happen if a delegation from
Madagascar arrived in New Jersey and told people they couldn't use
their cars to drive to work,'' said Maurice Bloch, who teaches at
the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and has worked in Madagascar for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the anthropological critics concede that
protecting the environment is ultimately in everyone's interest,
they feel that Western environmentalism needs to examine some of
its deepest assumptions. The idea of wilderness _ of pristine,
untouched nature _ is not a universal truth but an idea of Western
urban civilization, said Philippe Descola, a leading French
anthropologist who has worked among Indian groups in Brazil.
Virtually everything Westerners regard as ``nature'' has been
significantly modified by tens of thousands of years of human
presence, he said. Indeed, many indigenous peoples do not have a
special word for nature and do not see themselves as separate from
the environment in which they live.
</P>
<P>
   This seemingly abstract point has had powerful practical
consequences for the environmental movement, the anthropologists
insist. The world's first national park, Yellowstone, specifically
excluded people from living within its borders even though Shoshone
Indians were there at the time. In the first years after the
creation of the park in 1871, some 300 Shoshone were killed in
conflicts with the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a park that excluded human habitation was then
exported to the Third World by various colonial administrations,
particularly by the British and French in Africa and Asia. The big
game parks in Kenya and what is now Tanzania involved mass
expulsion of the Masai people. The French in Madagascar created a
series of nature preserves, and in the 1940s tried to force the
people living in the country's rain forests to leave their
villages. When people resisted, some 20,000 were killed in
conflicts with the French colonial authorities. Although methods
have grown gentler in recent decades, expulsions have continued at
some of the big parks in places like Kenya, Botswana, Indonesia and
Sri Lanka, said Marcus Colchester of the Rain Forest People's
Program in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Many ecologists feel that this criticism, while valid, is out of
date. ``I think the conservation movement has become much more
sophisticated in the last 20 years,'' said Don Melnick, a professor
of biology at Columbia University and the director of the Center
for Environmental Research and Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Melnick insisted, environmentalists have come to
see that local cooperation is essential to the success of their own
work. At Chitwan National Park in Nepal, he said, the government
recently reversed its policy of preventing local residents from
entering the forest. ``They designated a certain number of weeks in
which people could come in and collect grasses and plants they use
for baskets and as building materials, as long as they use
traditional and nonmechanized means for doing so,'' he said. ``It
resulted in a kind of festival of harvesting, and those people
became the greatest protectors of the resouces of the park. It
became theirs, and they were very vigilant about outsiders going
into the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Colchester agrees that environmental groups have become better
about recognizing the rights of local people. But he said that the
problem was that, in many places, ``this has yet to translate into
change on the ground; national governments have not kept pace with
the international guidelines.'' Recently, he went on, in defiance
of the international organizations that financed the project, the
government of Guyana extinguished the rights of local residents in
extending the boundaries of Kaietur National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists think this kind of pressure smacks of the
same neocolonalism that the anthropologists see in others. ``If the
federal government of Brazil decides it's strategically important
to set aside millions of acres for protection, isn't it neocolonial
if groups from outside tell them they shouldn't?'' asked Melnick.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the question of who has final say about land _ the
people who have traditionally lived on it, the regional and
national governments in the surrounding area, or international
groups who see the environment as a world heritage _ is extremely
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, both environmentalists and anthropologists agree, at
least in theory, that they are working on two sides of the same
problem. Conservation groups have estimated that 60 percent of the
world's biodiversity is contained in less than 5 percent of the
world's land mass. At the same time, the indigenous peoples who
generally inhabit those tropical biodiversity ``hot spots'' account
for as much as 60 percent of the world's 6,000 spoken languages,
according to the British ethnolinguist Suzanne Romaine of Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests of forest people and the interests of the
environmental people are similar,'' says Richard H. Grove, a
professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of
Canberra in Australia and the author of ``Green Imperialism.'' He
explains: ``The same environmental threats that are wiping out
species are wiping out indigeneous cultures as well.''

SUMMIT CONFEREES TACKLE `INTRACTABLE' MIDEAST ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: In 11th graf, ``today'' refers to Saturday.) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators slogged
through their fourth day of talks in secret Friday, wrestling with
what U.S. officials characterize as ``intractable issues'' in the
search for Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations continued at Camp David, officials hustled to
keep dissidents away from journalists and to keep a lid on details
of what is happening at the mountain retreat.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart dismissed reports that the
Palestinian delegation, led by Yasser Arafat, had threatened to
leave the summit when a proposal by the United States appeared to
favor Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any luggage,'' Lockhart said, acknowledging that
the talks are tense and will only get harder as they continue. At
the same time, he said, he has not seen any deterioration in the
two sides' willingness to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tensions every day when you try to work through
these issues,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with his senior advisers Friday morning after a
late-night round of one-on-one talks with Israel's top negotiator,
Shlomo Ben-Ami, and later with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, sessions that lasted until 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About midday, the Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. teams of
negotiators broke into small groups to focus on specific issues
that go to the heart of settling the 52-year Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On the table are the status of Jerusalem, the nature and borders
of a Palestinian state, the future of Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and whether more than 2 million Palestinian
refugees will be allowed to return to their homes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Whether either side was showing signs of yielding was not
evident during Lockhart's two briefings for a large group of
international journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are intractable issues,'' he said, ``These are issues
that go to the vital interests of both of the parties. So this is
very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal negotiations came to a halt at sundown Friday in
observance of the Jewish Sabbath. Still, Lockhart said, some
informal meetings were likely today but full-scale negotiations are
not expected to resume until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left the
presidential compound temporarily to meet with a group of
Palestinian leftists in nearby Emmitsburg, Md. The seven were
demanding an audience with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which wants Arafat and Barak to focus on
settling their differences without distractions, did not rule out
the possibility that Arafat could meet the delegation at some
future time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the spirit of the ground rules we've put down, we
indicated that we would prefer that that meeting not happen up at
Camp David,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the seven Palestinians, Tayseer Khaled, refused to meet
with Albright and accused the Americans of interfering in
Palestinian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to go to the meeting with Albright in protest of the
American behavior. This is meddling in Palestinian internal affairs
and the U.S. has no right to do that,'' said Khaled, a member of
the radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   American hosts barred Israeli or Palestinian delegation members
from visiting with reporters, and in the second such incident this
week an Israeli official was ushered out of an elementary school
being used as a press room about six miles from Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Limor Livnat, a spokeswoman for Israel's opposition Likud Party,
was asked to leave by State Department officials, then was escorted
from the press facility as she was outlining objections to Barak's
willingness to yield somewhat to Palestinian demands on Jerusalem
and the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit, Barak indicated that he was prepared to allow
the Palestinians a foothold in Jerusalem, where Arafat wants to
locate a Palestinian capital. Barak also signaled that the
strategic Jordan Valley could be turned over to the Palestinians if
they agree to allow Israel to establish early warning facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for compromises,'' said Livnat, a member of
Israel's Knisset. But Barak, she said, is the nation's first prime
minister who has agreed to discuss ``giving up Jerusalem.''

<P>
   The proportion of low-birthweight babies, those born weighing
less than 5.5 pounds, has been growing steadily since 1984, a
federal report released Thursday says. Most of the rise can be
attributed to the rapid increase in the number of multiple births,
especially to older white mothers using assisted-reproduction
techniques like in vitro fertilization and drugs that increase
ovulation.
</P>
<P>
   Such techniques often produce twins, triplets or quadruplets,
who are far more likely than single babies to be born prematurely,
and tiny. The number of twin births rose more than 50 percent from
1980 to 1997, while the number of triplets quadrupled _ with white
women older than 45 having the highest rate of multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiple births and assisted-reproductive technologies account
for the bulk of the increase in low-birthweight babies,'' said Dr.
Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development. ``It's become a substantial concern among
OB-GYNs, who are beginning to step back a little, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, if they get seven healthy fertilized embryos in
an in vitro attempt, they might put two or three back in, not all
seven. The problem is with the older mother, who may have only one
shot at pregnancy and wants them all. And then you get into whose
embryos are these, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks traditionally have had a higher rate of multiple births
than whites. But with more whites turning to assisted reproduction,
that gap has narrowed substantially; white mothers are now more
than twice as likely as blacks or Hispanics to have triplets.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the age of women giving birth has been creeping up;
Massachusetts has become the first state where women older than 30
now make up the majority of new mothers. And older women, overall,
run a higher risk of delivering a low-birthweight baby.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of low-birthweight babies is intensely
troubling to health policy makers, who have devoted enormous
resources in the last three decades to new programs intended to
offer easy access to prenatal care, in hopes of solving the
low-birthweight problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting back in the 1960s, there were all these programs to
provide care to low-income women earlier in pregnancy, and we
thought it would really make a difference,'' said Alexander. ``The
low-birthweight rate did go down in the '70s, but since the middle
of the 1980s, it's been going up. You have no idea how frustrating
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the latest year for which statistics are available,
low-birthweight babies made up 7.6 percent of the nation's births,
according to the report, ``America's Children: Key National
Indicators of Well Being 2000,'' which was released on Thursday.
While the current rate is not quite as high as the 7.9 percent rate
in 1970, it has climbed substantially since the low of 6.7 percent
reached in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of all logic and expectations, and everything we'd
like to see as policy makers, it's been very difficult to show that
prenatal care can reduce low birthweight,'' said Dalton Conley, a
sociologist at New York University who studies low-birthweight
babies. ``We still assume it makes a difference, but the research
doesn't show the effects.``
</P>
<P>
   Low-birthweight babies are a serious health concern, because
such infants are far more likely to have vision and hearing
impairments, cerebral palsy or impaired intellectual ability.

 &HT;    Judge objects to attorney's comments
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco,
ruddy complexion aside, was seeing red when he walked into federal
court Friday. The morning newspapers carried lead plaintiffs
attorney Mike Caddell's comment that Smith was trying to engineer a
verdict against the Branch Davidians in their wrongful-death
lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell took exception to Smith's instructions to the advisory
jury, which later in the day would find for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Smith didn't differentiate in the jury charge between men, women
and children. Instead, when asking jurors what degree of
responsibility those at Mount Carmel bore for what happened seven
years ago, Smith referred to ``the Davidians,'' as a group.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't need to read faces to gauge Smith's reaction to
Caddell's comment. Upon sitting down, Smith granted a government
motion. When Caddell stood up to respond, Smith snapped, ``Sit
down, Mr. Caddell.''
</P>
<P>
   Before bringing in the jury, Smith told the packed courtroom
that he wanted to ``set the record straight.'' The judge said he
didn't usually pay attention to media reports about trials,
accusing them of often being
</P>
<P>
   inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I am involved in a case where there is media
reporting, I do take an interest in that because I think it's
important for me to know what the jury might be exposed to,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Smith got down to the nitty-gritty. ``First of all, I have
not in any way tried to engineer the jury instructions or verdict
forms in order to have (certain) results,'' Smith said. ''I have
tried to simplify the jury charge in order to get to the bottom
line. That's all I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that it ``must be remembered by those with the
ability to understand'' that Congress denied those suing the
government the right to a jury trial. Judges, however, can appoint
advisory juries in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress simply did not trust juries to decide cases where the
government is being sued,'' Smith said. He then asked how many
lawyers in the courtroom had been involved in cases with advisory
juries, which provide a judge issuing a verdict an idea of how the
community feels about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Only Caddell raised his hand. It was a tactical error. ``That
absolutely amazes me, Mr. Caddell, because you're the one who seems
to have absolutely no understanding of the process,'' Smith told
him.
</P>
<P>
   With an advisory jury, he was free ``to take that advice or I
can reject it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell didn't respond to Smith's remarks. Caddell said later,
though, that he felt the need to tread lightly during his closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term 'Davidians' was not defined in the instructions given
to the jury, so I had to feel my way there,'' Caddell said.
``Obviously I didn't want the judge to come down on me in my
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the jury left at noon to deliberate, Smith had one more
thing to say about Caddell's accusation that he had lumped all the
Davidians together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully recognize that there are differences between children,
old people and active shooters,'' Smith said. ``All that will be
taken into consideration, sorted out and determined by me.''
</P>
<P>
   A government attorney said he was astounded by Caddell's public
comments about Smith. ``I thought we might have another suicide
plan to discuss,'' the attorney said. ``I am not familiar with that
kind of strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, was unapologetic. ``I'm going to say what's
right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell told a throng of media that he and Smith were in
agreement on one point. ``This (charge) does make it simpler,''
Caddell said. ``They don't have to go through individuals... That
doesn't change the fact that the charge that was submitted to the
jury does not reflect Texas law. I don't know any other way to say
that. And, frankly, I think the judge acknowledged that by saying
that when he makes a judgment he will make a decision on an
individual basis.''

 &HT;    Jury vindicates government in Davidian trial
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, TexAS _ A federal court jury in Waco on Friday placed
blame for the 1993 Branch Davidian tragedy squarely on the
shoulders of David Koresh and absolved government officials of
wrongdoing in the botched raid that killed nine and the fire in
which 76 sect members died.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, empaneled only to advise U.S. District Judge Walter S.
Smith Jr. on liability issues in the case, deliberated about 2 1/2
hours before unanimously finding in favor of the government after
the monthlong trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the $675 million wrongful-death lawsuit filed by
surviving Branch Davidians were whisked away from the federal
courthouse by federal marshals and were not present in the
courtroom when Smith read the verdict. The judge said the jury
would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found that 76 agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms did not use excessive force by firing indiscriminately
and without provocation when they came rolling up to Mount Carmel
in cattle trailers to arrest Koresh for weapons violations on Feb.
28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents were killed and16 were wounded during the fierce
two-hour gunbattle with Koresh and his followers. Five Branch
Davidians were killed that morning and a sixth was shot and killed
later than afternoon trying to enter the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which consisted of two white women, a white man, a
black man and a black woman, also ruled that the FBI was not
negligent in the way it handled the 51-day standoff and how it
chose to try to end the siege on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors answered no to each of three allegations remaining in the
trial pertaining to the April 19 fire, finding that FBI agents were
not negligent in using tanks to penetrate Mount Carmel; that they
did not contribute to the start or spread of the fire; and that the
government response to the fire was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford of Beaumont, the government's
co-lead counsel, said he hopes the jury's verdict will put the
controversy over Mount Carmel to rest. Bradford was flanked by 14
government attorneys and staff members as he talked to the press
after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gratified with the jury's verdict today,'' Bradford said.
``I think this is a vindication for the law enforcement officers
who were out at Mount Camrel in 1993 doing their duty, doing their
best to carry out their job in very difficult circumstances, very
dangerous circumstances. I think what this verdict shows is that
several of the positions we've taken are true. And that is the
Branch Davidians started the fire, burned down their own complex
and caused the tragedy that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of Houston said he was
unsure if he would appeal the verdict, which is an advisory verdict
to assist Smith, who will issue the final judgment in the case
later.
</P>
<P>
   The judge removed from the trial the issue of whether FBI agents
fired into Mount Carmel on the final day because a key expert
witness was not available for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the judge set a tentativyou take cases that are very,
very tough, and we knew this was going to be a tough case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that once we were transferred to Waco, it would be
tough. We didn't file this case in Waco. We offered to move this
case to any court in the Western District other than this court. We
went to the Supreme Court to try to get Judge Smith recused. So
that may tell you a little bit how hard the government fought to
get this case tried in front of this judge and how hard we fought
to keep it from being tried in front of this judge,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who was brought into the case when U.S. Attorney Bill
Blagg of San Antonio removed his office from the case, said he
hopes the trial will bring to a close a tragic chapter in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this puts to rest the concerns about federal law
enforcement's activities that day,'' Bradford said. ``This was a
randomly selected group of citizens that constituted a jury who
heard the evidence and came back with a very quick verdict in favor
of the law enforcement agencies. And I think that speaks volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he thinks that the ``vast majority'' of Americans
will take the verdict as the final word on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the American public won't know what the
jury charge looked like or won't know if it was in accord with
Texas law or not. What they will take away from this is that five
people sat on a jury through four weeks of a trial and issued a
verdict saying that the government was not negligent. I think that
is what people will take away from this, and for most peple that
will be the finish to Mount Carmel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final word, however, may belong to former Missouri Sen. John
Danforth, Caddell said. Attorney General Janet Reno appointed
Danforth as special counsel to review the FBI's actions at Mount
Carmel on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Senator Danforth has got some issues that he is
looking at similar to the issues we raised,'' Caddell said.
``Whether this verdict will influence his decision, I don't know.
I'm sure he would deny that. But the reality is that a jury verdict
like this makes it easier for Senator Danforth to conclude that
there was no government wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Koresh and his followers bore total
responsibility for the fiasco by resisting agents' efforts to serve
arrest and search warrants on Koresh on Feb. 28 and by setting fire
to the compound themselves. Bradford told the jury repeatedly
during his closing statements Friday morning that the Davidians
were under a spell cast by Koresh, yet could have come out of Mount
Carmel at any time during the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate Koresh's hold over his followers, Bradford
reminded the jury of testimony relating to the death of Davidian
Perry Jones, who was shot in the stomach during the initial raid
and refused medical attention offered by the government. He said
the 64-year-old Jones sent a message to Koresh asking if he could
commit suicide to end his suffering. He died from a gunshot wound
to the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you had to get permission to do anything at Mount
Carmel, you even had to get permission to kill yourself from David
Koresh,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell told the jurors in summations that their verdict would
send a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing about this case is that there will be
another David Koresh,'' Caddell said. ``I said in the beginning
that this case is about the children of Mount Carmel. But it is too
late to save them. So this is also about the next set of children,
those children who will be with the next David Koresh and the next
and the next. So what we do here will help those next children.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Caddell said he hopes the message to law
enforcement is not a negative one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does send a message to law enforcement, it would be a
bad one,'' he said. ``It would be one that sounds like tanks are OK
and knocking a building down like that and ignoring a plan that had
been carefully thought out is acceptable. I hope that that message
is not being sent to law enforcement because that would be pretty
frightening, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Davidian civil lawsuit jury Friday answered the
questions put to it by the court:
</P>
<P>
   Did the plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
the ATF used excessive force on Feb. 28, 1993, either:
</P>
<P>
   1. by firing at Mount Carmel without provocation? NO
</P>
<P>
   2. by using indiscriminate gunfire at Mount Carmel? NO
</P>
<P>
   Did the plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
the FBI acted negligently on April 19, 1993, in one or more of the
following respects?
</P>
<P>
   1. by using tanks to penetrate Mount Carmel other than in
accordance with the approved Plan of Operations on April 19, 1993.
NO
</P>
<P>
   2. by starting or contributing to the spread of the fire at
Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993. NO
</P>
<P>
   3. by affirmatively deciding to have ``no plan to fight a fire''
at Mount Carmel, despite Attorney General Reno's directive that
required ``sufficient emergency vehicles to respond both from a
medical and any other point of view.'' NO

 &HT;    Waller cruises into high jump final
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ For Tisha Waller, qualifying Friday in the
high jump proved a piece of cake. The Atlanta school teacher's
training partner, Lynn Houston, didn't have it quite so easy, but
she, too, advanced to Sunday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   Waller, reigning U.S. champion and an Atlanta Olympian, easily
cleared 5 feet, 10 3/4 inches in her first attempt. Houston
required a second attempt for clearance. But after just 25 minutes
of jumping at the single height at the U.S. Olympic Trials, the
field of 24 had been whittled in half for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked it didn't take more attempts,'' said Waller, who
has a personal-best clearance of 6-7. ``I was hoping we'd get to
attempt two or three heights so I could get more work on the
(jumping) surface. I still have to make the team. Nothing is being
given to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be an upset if Waller isn't Sydney-bound, however, with
her battling Amy Acuff and Gwen Wentland for the top spot. Houston
would be happy just to leave town having improved her personal-best
of 6-0 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old is the younger sister of NBA star Allen Houston.
Next month, she'll complete the master's program in industrial
engineering at Georgia Tech. But her performance here will be the
test of whether she goes shopping for a real job or sticks with the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally assumed a clearance of at least 6-4 will be
required to make the team. That's the dream of Houston, whose
brother is attending a wedding in Detroit but called Friday to wish
her luck.
</P>
<P>
   As for her brother's game, Lynn said she dabbled with minimal
success on her high school basketball team. ``All I could do was
run fast and block shots,'' she said. ``I wasn't a scorer like
him.''

 &HT;    Davidian trial plaintiffs anticipated jury verdict
 &HT;    By Martha Ashe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Survivors of the tragedy at Mount Carmel and
relatives of Branch Davidians who died in the blaze said Friday
they did not expect to find justice in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the wrongful-death case against the government
blamed Waco residents, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith and federal
agents after the five-member advisory jury returned a verdict
Friday against the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general who represented
some of the plaintiffs, huddled outside the courtroom after the
verdict with Davidians and their relatives, telling them they could
not have received a fair trial in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were making a statement, on behalf of the Waco community,
by deliberating less than three hours to arrive at a verdict, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a statement (saying), `We don't like people like that,'
'' Clark said. ``Religion is a factor, but the demonization of that
is part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark compared Waco's relationship to the Davidians to Dallas'
desire to distance itself from the assassination of President
Kennedy. Except, he said, in Waco's case, ``they were homegrown.''
</P>
<P>
   David Koresh and 75 others died April 19, 1993, when the 51-day
government seige of the Branch Davidian compound at Mount Carmel
ended in fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Haldeman, Koresh's mother, said jurors had their minds
made up before they began deliberating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of good people in Waco . . . but I think
what you hear mostly is the voice of the few,'' Haldeman said.
``I'm not disappointed. If you don't expect something, you can't be
disappointed . . . The jury was sort of a farce, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Burgo, whose father Floyd Houtman died in the 1993 fire,
said the jury's verdict was as painful for her as the day the Mount
Carmel compound went up in flames, though in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often think of him,'' Sherry Burgo said. ``I know he's
probably not happy'' with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was more specific. ``I know what he would say,''
Kenneth Burgo said. ``He would say, `Wait on God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Burgos traveled from their home in Massachusetts for the
four-week trial. Now they said they will await the ruling from
Smith, who will consider the decision of the ``advisory jury,'' and
hope an appeals court will see the case their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be strong,'' Sherry Burgo said. ``Once we're
out of Waco, we'll have a chance. All I wanted was justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't fair from the beginning. We weren't allowed to bring
in evidence to present the case. All our evidence was destroyed at
Mount Carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burgos blame Smith for rulings that prevented the plaintiffs
from presenting evidence that the fire did not destroy. They blamed
the federal government for covering up its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you try a case when you see a judge being one-sided?''
Kenneth Burgo said. ``This here was just a big joke to (the federal
government). They knew they were going to railroad this case before
they even got here.''
</P>
<P>
   For Branch Davidian Sheila Martin of Waco, Friday's verdict
against the Davidians was a reflection of people's rejection of the
sect's religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take it one day at a time,'' Martin said. ``All you could
do was sit and listen (as the verdict is read) and hold your
breath. . . . Our trust is in God. You can't depend on any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch Davidian Clive Doyle of Waco, who escaped the fire and
later was acquitted in the 1994 criminal trial, said the verdict
was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming for the whole month,'' Doyle said. ``I didn't
expect anything different with the way it was set up with all the
restrictions the judge put on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned from the trial is to try to avoid a
confrontation with the government, which will win in the end, Doyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that you better not be on the receiving end of
the government.'' he said. ``They demonize you and justify anything
they want to do to you.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, who lost an 18-year-old daughter in the fire, said he
doesn't think the trial will put to rest any of the questions
remaining from Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will change anybody's mind. There are still
those questions out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is expected to make a final ruling on the case later this
summer, after an August hearing to consider evidence on whether
federal agents fired gunshots at the compound the day of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jury acted in an advisory capacity, Smith could
disregard its verdict and rule in the Davidians' favor.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, the plaintiffs' attorney, said he doesn't expect that
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem likely,'' Clark said. ``One of the great
things about life is it's full of surprises. Not lately, though.''

D.C. UNITED NO LONGER AN MLS BULLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Nearly everywhere D.C. United plays a soccer game
these days, coach Thomas Rongen faces the same questions:
</P>
<P>
   What in the world happened?
</P>
<P>
   How did the arrogant Goliath of Major League Soccer turn into a
puppy dog overnight?
</P>
<P>
   Since the league was born in 1996, United has played in the MLS
Cup annually, winning three titles, becoming the envy and target of
every franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Galaxy opened United's season with a 4-0 beating
against the defending champions at RFK Stadium in March, United
hasn't recovered. Each day, week and month since has been a
humbling and humiliating experience for United, which has the
league's worst record.
</P>
<P>
   What little life is left in United will be on display tonight at
the Rose Bowl as the Galaxy attempts to sweep its four-game season
series against the long-time MLS bullies without six starters
because of national team duty.
</P>
<P>
   United's fall from glory is baffling ,if not impossible to
understand. This is basically the same team minus striker Roy
Lassiter that beat the Galaxy 2-0 last October to capture its third
title.
</P>
<P>
   But after Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Tampa Bay, United dropped to
4-13-6 with 18 points. United is 1-4-5 in its last 10 matches and
two of its last three games were 3-0 beatings.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's practice at the Rose Bowl, Rongen shook his head,
stared at the turf and offered a simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have under-performed,'' said Rongen. ``You can use the
analogy from the movie `A Perfect Storm': A lot of things at the
same time went haywire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with under-performing, then there were injuries,
national team and Olympic team duty and then not getting the luck
that good teams normally get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything collided at one time and we're still trying to
recover from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman nodded his head yes when asked
if he enjoyed United's fall to the worst record in MLS nine points
behind Dallas (8-11-3, 27 points), which holds the eighth and final
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to wish something bad on anybody, but I think a
lot of people have adverse feelings about how D.C. handles
themselves around the league,'' said Hartman. ``There has been some
ring-waving going on, so yeah, it's hard to feel for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri echoed Hartman's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think deep down inside most of the players in this league
are happy about what's happened to them because they pretty much
stole the show since the league began,'' said Caligiuri. ``I really
can't answer what didn't motivate them to come out and play the way
they have in prior seasons because most of their roster is still
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen admits his team is getting no sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made 11 coaches and 11 general managers very
happy,'' he said. ``There is no one shedding tears over what has
happened to us, but we expected that. We built a dynasty here, so
regardless of our record, we're the game everyone points to.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent loss, midfielder Richie Williams and Rongen were
nose to nose, screaming at each other after Williams was taken out
of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Etcheverry, a two-time MLS MVP and the league's best
playmaker, has lost his cool on occasions. He was ejected the last
time D.C. visited L.A. after taking a nasty swipe at Mauricio
Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all the small things start to happen to them and now
it's added up,'' said Hartman. ``Sometimes you see players fighting
with a coach, or this or that. I think they can sense (the season)
starting to get away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean United isn't taking this last stretch of games
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno are in town instead of with Bolivia
for a national team game. Even so, United is missing Ben Olsen and
Jeff Agoos because of injuries, along with Raul Diaz Arce (El
Salvador) and Eddie Pope (U.S.), who are with their national teams.
</P>
<P>
   With only nine matches left, Rongen admits United needs to win
nearly all of them to reach the postseason and defend its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our last game a lot of guys played with a lot of energy and
a lot of heart,'' said Rongen. ``We've got a huge task ahead of us.
Every game is a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to be in this situation but this is the hole we
have dug for ourselves. We'll just have to find out if we can dig
ourselves out.''

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Gephardt has emerged high on Al Gore's
list of possible running mates, people close to Gore say. But
there's a big problem: Gephardt's advisers insist that he wants his
name scratched.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the advisers said a Gephardt emissary on Friday
telephoned Warren Christopher, who is leading Gore's search, to
tell him that Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, would not fill
out a detailed questionnaire about his voting record and would not
hand over any financial and personal information because he does
not want to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers to Gephardt said he had breakfast with Gore last
Saturday at the vice president's residence here _ at Gephardt's
request _ to tell him personally the reasons why Gore should not
pick him.
</P>
<P>
   The main argument was that it would greatly complicate the
Democrats' drive to retake the House. Gephardt also argued that if
Gore became president, he could be more helpful to him in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in any way trying to be cute,'' said a Gephardt
confidant. ``He would be very happy if they picked someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that Gephardt is being cute. His
advisers refuse to declare flatly that he would never take the job
under any circumstances. And Jack Kemp, who was Bob Dole's running
mate four years ago, recalled that he had repeatedly told Dole he
did not want to be picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Would you be interested in being my running mate?'
'' Kemp said in an interview. ``I said, `Well, I'm flattered but I
don't know that I'm the best running mate. You need an attack dog
and I'm not known as an attack dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it seems clear that Gore is seriously interested in
Gephardt. But Gephardt's resistance underscores the difficulty he
may be facing in settling on an appealing choice.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats agree that there seems to be a dearth of options
with sizzle. For all his appeal as a seasoned, respected politician
from the hotly contested state of Missouri, many Democrats said
Gephardt was far from electrifying. And his advisers said he would
rather stay where he is, poised to become speaker if the Democrats
win back the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good people around, but I don't think the
Democratic Party has done a particularly good job of showcasing
them, and we're paying a price for it,'' said Robert Strauss, a
former Democratic national chairman and wise man in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Among others under consideration, according to prominent
Democrats and people close to the process, are Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, former Sen. George
Mitchell of Maine, Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Sen. Evan
Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Gephardt, it could be, as often happens in
presidential politics, that the Gore campaign is floating his name
as a trial balloon. Who really knows the vice president's
intentions? Probably only Gore and his wife, Tipper, Christopher,
and, maybe, William Daley, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of the dangers of all the uninformed speculation,
Michael Whouley, one of Gore's top strategists, said, ``None of the
sirens of conventional wisdom have actually had a conversation with
Apollo.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, Gore's overtures to Gephardt are being
taken seriously enough that they have set off maneuvering among
House Democrats over who would fill Gephardt's job as the House
Democratic leader and speaker-in-waiting) if he left.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the No. 2 Democrat, telephoned
reporters Friday to assure them that prospects for House Democrats
would not be jeopardized if he was to serve as the acting leader in
place of Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the leadership in the caucus would rally behind me as
acting leader,'' he said in an interview, ``and we would have a
very close coordinated relationship with the Gore-Gephardt ticket
if that's where all this moves to.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not say what he thought Gephardt should do. In an
interview earlier this summer, Bonior cited Rep. Robert Menendez of
New Jersey and Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, among others
as good possibilities. Asked why he did not mention Gephardt as one
of his favorites, Bonior replied, ``I didn't think it was a real
possibility then.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Gephardt said he had thought hard about Gore's
entreaties but that they posed a serious quandary for him: would he
be more valuable on the national ticket or helping his party try to
win control of the House? And what about his own ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   Although he has long had designs on the White House, Gephardt,
who is 59, decided not to take on Gore for the nomination this year
so he could devote his efforts to picking up enough House seats to
assure himself of becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's associates said that he would rather be speaker than
vice president but that he recognized either perch could be a
jumping off point for a later bid for president. (But while several
vice presidents have moved up, no speaker has ever advanced
directly to the White House.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Both races are, in my view, a tossup,'' said one person who
has discussed the predicament with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's interest is understandable. Gephardt has a deep command
of the issues, is popular with many constituency groups like labor,
where Gore still has to do some fence mending. He could also assure
Gore that the ticket would be more competitive in Missouri.
Gephardt is also a seasoned campaigner who would effectively make a
case for the Democrats, and tear down Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, Gephardt is hardly a fresh face. And he
would contribute to the feel that the ticket is composed of two
longtime Washington insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Already Friday, CNN was broadcasting excerpts of tense moments
between Gore and Gephardt in a debate in 1988. In fact, the two
long had an icy relationship dating back to when they battled each
other that year for the Democratic nomination _ and both lost to
Michael S. Dukakis. But in the last two years, their relationship
has warmed appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   And nominees have never hesitated to turn to foes as running
mates. Dole and Kemp had never been pals. When John Kennedy picked
Lyndon Johnson, their relationship had long been bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare and wondrous event when something happens such as
a Kennedy picking Johnson and Johnson taking the job, which he
regretted for years,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
``Oh God, what a torment that was for him!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one ever disputed the outcome: Johnson was crucial in
assuring that the Democrats won.

 &HT;    BB&AMP;T to put its name on 45 Atlanta banks
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Signs of change will be showing up over 45
Atlanta-area banks Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Winston-Salem, N.C.-based BB&AMP;T Corp. will change the signs and
operating systems of the Atlanta-area branches of First Citizens
Corp. and Premier Bancshares, both acquired over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   And while most folks may see the new signs as just another name
on their bank statements, the folks who run or invest in many of
Atlanta's smaller banks may see opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: BB&AMP;T Corp. says it wants to buy or build more banks
totaling at least $2 billion in assets in Georgia, which it sees as
its next logical growth market.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year-and-a-half, BB&AMP;T has acquired five Georgia
banks with $5 billion in assets, including Newnan, Ga.-based First
Citizens in July and Atlanta-based Premier Bancshares in January.
</P>
<P>
   That puts BB&AMP;T in the No. 8 spot both in Georgia and the Atlanta
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be in the top five in the markets we serve,''
said John Allison, BB&AMP;T's chief executive officer. ``We need about
$2 billion in additional assets in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank prefers to get there with acquisitions. During
the past 10 years, BB&AMP;T has acquired 45 community banking
companies, bringing itself to $55 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   BB&AMP;T was rumored last week to be interested in Birmingham-based
SouthTrust, which has almost $44 billion in assets and operations
in eight states, including Georgia and the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   But Allison said BB&AMP;T is not interested in a merger of
equal-sized banks or the Alabama market, at least now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, yes. Right now, we're focused on our
footprint,'' he said, referring to growth within its seven-state
territory stretching from Washington, D.C., to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   SouthTrust officials dismissed speculation last week that it is
in talks with BB&AMP;T, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is the timing is not correct for either company,''
said Christopher Marinac, a Robinson-Humphrey analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Inman, chief executive officer of Tucker Federal Bank, said
he's noticed commercial lending activity has picked up since BB&AMP;T's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Federal is part of Tucker-based Eagle Bancshares, which
has $1.2 billion in assets and 14 branches in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have been actively recruiting commercial loan
officers,'' said Inman.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a newcomer like BB&AMP;T can probably capture 10
percent of the Atlanta market by concentrating on commercial
customers too small to be targeted by Atlanta's four largest banks,
Bank of America, Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks and First Union
Corp.

   SALINA, Kan. _ From complaints about impolite cell-phone users
to gripes over bad service at restaurants, it seems that everyone's
gotten a bit prickly over everyone else's manners _ or lack
thereof. This perception that civility is on the decline has taken
hold not only in places often associated with rudeness, like busy
Eastern cities, but also in the supposedly more mannerly cultures
of the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   I can't comment on conditions elsewhere, but I would argue that
this so-called rash of incivility has not pervaded the country
completely. Civility in Kansas and the rest of the heartland, for
example, remains intact. It has endured because it comes not so
much from any strict code of etiquette but from a comfortable lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   In my 43 years living in the heartland, I can think of only two
instances in which I was the victim of what I consider overt
rudeness. Both were perpetrated by people who were trying to
enforce their own brand of etiquette. Both ran against the relaxed,
live-and-let-live attitude that to me has always seemed the gentle
core of Plains culture.
</P>
<P>
   Both involved my hat.
</P>
<P>
   In third grade, in my hometown of McCook, Neb., I wore my Cub
Scout uniform, cap and all, to school. I was pretty proud of it.
But the principal had only one thing to say: ``Do Cub Scouts wear
their hats in the house?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only sentence I remember her speaking to me in the
five years I attended that school. I took the hat off, stifling the
urge to tell her we were not in a house.
</P>
<P>
   The second time was in 1984. I was having an early dinner in a
bookstore-coffee shop in the artsy Westport neighborhood of Kansas
City, Mo. It was a warm day, and I was wearing a white Panama hat.
I thought it looked quite jaunty.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of older women rose to leave from a nearby table. As they
passed me, one leaned over and said: ``I must say, I remember a day
when a gentleman would never wear his hat inside a building.''
</P>
<P>
   I left it on, stifling the urge to tell her she was no lady for
insulting a perfect stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland men like John Wayne (from Winterset, Iowa) and Henry
Fonda (from Omaha) would be more likely to have said something
like, ``Well, you do as you please _ just don't get in my way,''
than tell someone that what he or she was doing was impolite _ even
if they generally took their hats off to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the Plains, we don't get in each other's way much.
As long as that standard is met, friction stays at a minimum. Road
rage is not the rage here _ we don't have to fight for parking
spaces and spend as much time on crowded freeways as other
Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the Kansas solution to those who are worried about a
decline in civility: Don't worry so much. It only makes you cranky.

BACKYARD ASTRONOMER DISCOVERS NEARBY ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a lucky mistake.
</P>
<P>
   As Fitchburg, Mass. schoolteacher Leonard Amburgey was using his
backyard observatory earlier this month, he was carrying on a
conversation with friends outside through an open window, and the
distraction caused him to mistype one of the numbers entered on a
computer to aim his telescope at a specific point in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that error, what he saw through the scope was not
what he expected. The streak of light that appeared in that patch
of sky turned out to be an asteroid on a path that sometimes takes
it across the Earth's orbit, making Amburgey the first person in
Massachusetts to discover a near-Earth asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky about it,'' Amburgey said in an interview
Friday. ``It was a pretty good nugget. I was quite astounded.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also one of the few amateur astronomers ever to make such
a discovery. Most such finds are now made by one of a handful of
large, constant professional surveys aimed specifically at
protecting the Earth by tracking objects that might someday be on a
collision course.
</P>
<P>
   Amburgey's asteroid, called 2000 NM, is not a threat; its orbit
will keep it safely away from Earth for at least the next million
years, according to Brian Marsden, the Cambridge, Mass. astronomer
who runs the official world clearinghouse for information on new
astronomical finds.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that 2000 NM was found accidentally by an amateur
with a relatively small telescope underscores the crucial role that
amateurs still play in the field of astronomy _ not to mention in
the field of serving as cosmic lookouts for our planet. Someday,
such a discovery could help to save the Earth from being blindsided
by a hurtling space rock similar to the one that is thought to have
destroyed the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But Amburgey, who teaches astronomy and environmental science at
Leominster (Mass.) High School and a graduate course to science
teachers at Fitchburg State College, wasn't out to make any
discoveries. Rather, he has been spending every available clear
night for the last five years observing asteroids, helping with the
unglamorous but crucial work of doing follow-up observations of
asteroids discovered by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is not discovery,'' Amburgey said. Those who
concentrate on trying to discover asteroids, comets or supernovas,
as many amateurs do, end up spending most of their nights taking
dozens of pictures that then are thrown away because they produce
no new finds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've done 15 or 20 measurements'' in a night, ``they're all
useful, they go into the database. If something unique happens _
like discovering an asteroid _ that's icing on the cake.'' That has
happened twice before, in 1997, when he found two ``main belt''
asteroids _ the ordinary, relatively commonplace kind.
</P>
<P>
   But the new find is different. ``Something like this is more
than just icing,'' he added. Near-Earth asteroids are special not
only because they are much rarer _ fewer than 600 are known,
compared to more than 10,000 main belt asteroids, which orbit
between Mars and Jupiter. They are also of greater interest because
they are the only ones that could someday threaten human
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Amburgey has received more than 100 congratulatory
e-mail messages from amateur and professional astronomers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is only through the dedicated efforts of amateurs like him in
many countries, Marsden explained, that the orbits of such
asteroids can be determined. Without their work, it would be a much
more difficult, if not impossible, task to determine whether there
is a rock out there with Earth's name on it. Earth has been
pummeled in the past and someday, astronomers say, there will be
another asteroid headed our way; it might be tomorrow or a million
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Amburgey was able to find the unusually bright
asteroid when the pros missed it, Marsden said, was because most of
the professional search telescopes are concentrated in one area _
Arizona and New Mexico _ that typically receives an onslaught of
heavy rain and stormy weather every July and August. Local
residents refer to it as the monsoon season. And one of the few
search efforts outside that region, based in Hawaii, has been in
limited operation lately because of changes being made to equipment
there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, until late June this particular asteroid was in a
part of the sky that could only be observed from the Southern
Hemisphere, and at present there is no ongoing search program for
near-Earth asteroids south of the equator. A long-term effort based
in Australia had to shut down two years ago for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   So that left Amburgey and his typing error to make the find,
even though the asteroid was brighter, and thus easier to find,
than most.
</P>
<P>
   Among the string of random events that helped to make the
discovery possible was the fact that Amburgey was feeling sleepy
that evening, thanks in part to the early rising time of his
4-year-old twins. Despite his dedication to backyard astronomy,
which he has been pursuing since 1985, he explains, ``I'm not
really a night person.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Jury vindicates government in Davidian trial
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, TexAS _ A federal court jury in Waco on Friday placed
blame for the 1993 Branch Davidian tragedy squarely on the
shoulders of David Koresh and absolved government officials of
wrongdoing in the botched raid that killed nine and the fire in
which 76 sect members died.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, empaneled only to advise U.S. District Judge Walter S.
Smith Jr. on liability issues in the case, deliberated about 2 1/2
hours before unanimously finding in favor of the government after
the monthlong trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the $675 million wrongful-death lawsuit filed by
surviving Branch Davidians were whisked away from the federal
courthouse by federal marshals and were not present in the
courtroom when Smith read the verdict. The judge said the jury
would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors found that 76 agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms did not use excessive force by firing indiscriminately
and without provocation when they came rolling up to Mount Carmel
in cattle trailers to arrest Koresh for weapons violations on Feb.
28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents were killed and16 were wounded during the fierce
two-hour gunbattle with Koresh and his followers. Five Branch
Davidians were killed that morning and a sixth was shot and killed
later than afternoon trying to enter the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which consisted of two white women, a white man, a
black man and a black woman, also ruled that the FBI was not
negligent in the way it handled the 51-day standoff and how it
chose to try to end the siege on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors answered no to each of three allegations remaining in the
trial pertaining to the April 19 fire, finding that FBI agents were
not negligent in using tanks to penetrate Mount Carmel; that they
did not contribute to the start or spread of the fire; and that the
government response to the fire was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford of Beaumont, the government's
co-lead counsel, said he hopes the jury's verdict will put the
controversy over Mount Carmel to rest. Bradford was flanked by 14
government attorneys and staff members as he talked to the press
after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gratified with the jury's verdict today,'' Bradford said.
``I think this is a vindication for the law enforcement officers
who were out at Mount Camrel in 1993 doing their duty, doing their
best to carry out their job in very difficult circumstances, very
dangerous circumstances. I think what this verdict shows is that
several of the positions we've taken are true. And that is the
Branch Davidians started the fire, burned down their own complex
and caused the tragedy that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of Houston said he was
unsure if he would appeal the verdict, which is an advisory verdict
to assist Smith, who will issue the final judgment in the case
later.
</P>
<P>
   The judge removed from the trial the issue of whether FBI agents
fired into Mount Carmel on the final day because a key expert
witness was not available for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the judge set a tentative hearing date for Aug. 2 to
hear testimony from David Oxlee, a specialist in infrared tape
analysis from England who works for Vector Data System and who is
recovering from recent cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The judge indicated he would issue a judgment in the entire case
after hearing Oxlee's analysis of a March gunfire recreation at
Fort Hood that was captured on infrared cameras. The recreation did
not prove the plaintiffs' claims of government gunfire on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get this all disposed of at the earliest date
possible,'' Smith told the parties to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell hinted after the trial that he might not pursue the
allegations pending over the gunfire issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the judge has his decision to make and the jury
is advisory, but I think from a practical matter, we would
recognize that there will be no judgment against the government
issued by Judge Smith,'' Caddell said. ``I wouldn't be foolish
enough to suggest otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell was critical of the judge's instructions to the jury,
charging that they were designed to elicit a verdict favorable to
the government. The judge angrily denied those claims Friday
morning before bringing in the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not someone who pursues lost causes,'' Caddell said. ``I
think there are enough causes that can be won that you don't have
to pursue the lost ones, generally. But I also think that
sometimes, as a matter of principle, you take cases that are very,
very tough, and we knew this was going to be a tough case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that once we were transferred to Waco, it would be
tough. We didn't file this case in Waco. We offered to move this
case to any court in the Western District other than this court. We
went to the Supreme Court to try to get Judge Smith recused. So
that may tell you a little bit how hard the government fought to
get this case tried in front of this judge and how hard we fought
to keep it from being tried in front of this judge,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who was brought into the case when U.S. Attorney Bill
Blagg of San Antonio removed his office from the case, said he
hopes the trial will bring to a close a tragic chapter in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this puts to rest the concerns about federal law
enforcement's activities that day,'' Bradford said. ``This was a
randomly selected group of citizens that constituted a jury who
heard the evidence and came back with a very quick verdict in favor
of the law enforcement agencies. And I think that speaks volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he thinks that the ``vast majority'' of Americans
will take the verdict as the final word on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the American public won't know what the
jury charge looked like or won't know if it was in accord with
Texas law or not. What they will take away from this is that five
people sat on a jury through four weeks of a trial and issued a
verdict saying that the government was not negligent. I think that
is what people will take away from this, and for most peple that
will be the finish to Mount Carmel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final word, however, may belong to former Missouri Sen. John
Danforth, Caddell said. Attorney General Janet Reno appointed
Danforth as special counsel to review the FBI's actions at Mount
Carmel on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Senator Danforth has got some issues that he is
looking at similar to the issues we raised,'' Caddell said.
``Whether this verdict will influence his decision, I don't know.
I'm sure he would deny that. But the reality is that a jury verdict
like this makes it easier for Senator Danforth to conclude that
there was no government wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Koresh and his followers bore total
responsibility for the fiasco by resisting agents' efforts to serve
arrest and search warrants on Koresh on Feb. 28 and by setting fire
to the compound themselves. Bradford told the jury repeatedly
during his closing statements Friday morning that the Davidians
were under a spell cast by Koresh, yet could have come out of Mount
Carmel at any time during the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate Koresh's hold over his followers, Bradford
reminded the jury of testimony relating to the death of Davidian
Perry Jones, who was shot in the stomach during the initial raid
and refused medical attention offered by the government. He said
the 64-year-old Jones sent a message to Koresh asking if he could
commit suicide to end his suffering. He died from a gunshot wound
to the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you had to get permission to do anything at Mount
Carmel, you even had to get permission to kill yourself from David
Koresh,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell told the jurors in summations that their verdict would
send a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing about this case is that there will be
another David Koresh,'' Caddell said. ``I said in the beginning
that this case is about the children of Mount Carmel. But it is too
late to save them. So this is also about the next set of children,
those children who will be with the next David Koresh and the next
and the next. So what we do here will help those next children.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Caddell said he hopes the message to law
enforcement is not a negative one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does send a message to law enforcement, it would be a
bad one,'' he said. ``It would be one that sounds like tanks are OK
and knocking a building down like that and ignoring a plan that had
been carefully thought out is acceptable. I hope that that message
is not being sent to law enforcement because that would be pretty
frightening, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Davidian civil lawsuit jury Friday answered the
questions put to it by the court:
</P>
<P>
   Did the plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
the ATF used excessive force on Feb. 28, 1993, either:
</P>
<P>
   1. by firing at Mount Carmel without provocation? NO
</P>
<P>
   2. by using indiscriminate gunfire at Mount Carmel? NO
</P>
<P>
   Did the plaintiffs prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
the FBI acted negligently on April 19, 1993, in one or more of the
following respects?
</P>
<P>
   1. by using tanks to penetrate Mount Carmel other than in
accordance with the approved Plan of Operations on April 19, 1993.
NO
</P>
<P>
   2. by starting or contributing to the spread of the fire at
Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993. NO
</P>
<P>
   3. by affirmatively deciding to have ``no plan to fight a fire''
at Mount Carmel, despite Attorney General Reno's directive that
required ``sufficient emergency vehicles to respond both from a
medical and any other point of view.'' NO

GAY GROUP'S SUIT TARGETS BAY STATE SODOMY LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After numerous unsuccessful attempts in the Legislature
to repeal the state's centuries-old sex statutes, a gay rights
group has filed suit asking the state's highest court to declare
the laws prohibiting sodomy unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Filed by Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders and several
individual gay and straight plaintiffs _ since the laws apply to
both _ the suit asks the Supreme Judicial Court to make a
declaratory judgment that the sodomy laws violate state
constitutional rights of privacy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The laws make Massachusetts one of only 17 states in the nation
that criminalize certain types of homosexual and heterosexual
behavior, including oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Levi, an attorney for GLAD, said the suit was spurred
in part by failed legislative attempts to repeal the laws, which
are rarely prosecuted, though Levi said she knows of incidents in
which people have been arrested on sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been very significant efforts made to try to
address this issue through the Legislature and they have all simply
hit dead ends,'' Levi said. ``The statute is so clearly in
violation of the privacy and dignity guaranteed to all citizens of
the Commonwealth that it calls out for judicial redress.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was also fueled by several recent legislative repeals
and judicial decisions that have struck down sodomy laws in other
states, including Maryland, Montana, Tennessee, Nevada, Rhode
Island, New York, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia and Michigan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, Massachusetts stands alone as the only state
with laws criminalizing sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative and religious organizations insist that
the laws provide a crucial moral template.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue goes to the very heart of the matter when it comes
to society and homosexuality, which is that it's been the settled
conviction of civilizations for centuries that sodomy is a crime
against nature,'' said C.J. Doyle, executive director of the
Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, which has opposed
legislation to repeal the state's sodomy statues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the law is a teacher,'' Doyle added, ``and the laws
ought to remain on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit names as defendants Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly,
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, and Middlesex
District Attorney Martha Coakley.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coakley declined to comment, saying she hadn't
yet been served with the suit. Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for
Martin, said he had ``never heard of a single case'' in Suffolk
County of a person being prosecuted for a sex act that took place
in private, although arrests are frequently made for public
lewdness.
</P>
<P>
   Borghesani added that Martin ``enjoys great support from the
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office issued a statement saying only
that, ``We are defending the district attorneys and look forward to
the opportunity to present the case and allow the courts to clarify
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has two sodomy statutes, one prohibiting ``the
abominable and detestable crime against nature,'' which case law
has defined as anal sex, and one prohibiting ``unnatural acts,''
which various court rulings have applied to both oral and anal sex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the laws apply both to certain homosexual and
heterosexual acts, Levi said their existence encourages anti-gay
sentiment, since laws regulating sexual intimacy are often
associated, even if incorrectly, with gay people.
</P>
<P>
   And in practice, she noted, the laws are enforced almost
exclusively against same-sex sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   The mere existence of the statutes sends the message that ``gay
men and lesbians aren't worthy of protection as individuals in
Massachusetts,'' she argued, adding that the laws ``have a
tremendously negative effect'' on the dignity and self-worth of gay
people.
</P>
<P>
   Levi also contends that the statutes ``legitimate or encourage
violence, police entrapment, and even discrimination'' against
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said that prosecutors have other tools to enforce laws
against public lewdness, including laws against indecent exposure
and public sexual exposure, charges she said are ``completely
distinct from sodomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Striking down the sodomy statutes doesn't remove from the
state its ability to prosecute offenses involving public conduct,''
Levi said, noting that at least two state laws prohibit indecent
exposure and public sexual exposure. ``All is does is to remove the
state's ability to regulate some of the ways in which people
express intimacy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the dawn of the nuclear age a half-century
ago, when J. Robert Oppenheimer moved from Berkeley, Calif., to the
New Mexico desert and led the effort to build the atomic bomb, the
University of California has been the government's close partner in
running its nuclear laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the post-Cold War era, this historic relationship has
endured because of a belief that the university was uniquely suited
to nurturing the independent scientific minds needed for creating
these complex weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, and unexpectedly, the partnership is poised for
unsettling changes, and not because the threat of nuclear war has
all but disappeared and the mission of the laboratories has
altered.
</P>
<P>
   The series of security lapses that have swamped the Los Alamos
National Laboratory over the past year have disrupted that bedrock
partnership and put the government on an uncertain new course of
breaking free, at least partly, from the University of California
system.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest last year of a scientist on charges of mishandling
vast amounts of secret data, the unexplained disappearance and then
reappearance of computer hard drives packed with classified
material, and a growing climate of anxiety about further criminal
investigations related to misplaced secrets have prompted the
government to consider contracting out some duties to private
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary, Bill Richardson, has announced that he
will strip the university of its oversight of security at Los
Alamos and the other two government labs it manages, as well as
some functions like construction management. The university would
still manage the most significant tasks _ research, for example _
ensuring the reliability of the nuclear stockpile and
administration.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shift, though, that some people feel could have subtle
but profound implications for the scientists at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the current tension between the government and the
university reflects a wider historic clash that has been present at
Los Alamos since its inception. The scientists have long argued
that without a free flow of information they cannot accomplish
their tasks, while the government has contended that too much
openness can harm national security.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that tightening security now outside the
university's control could undermine the whole rationale for having
an academic institution overseeing weapons research _ maintaining a
semblance of intellectual freedom _ which is required for
scientific innovation _ even while following strict secrecy
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The university has long argued that its solid academic
reputation and influence traditionally shielded the laboratories'
scientists from some potentially stifling government restrictions
on communication, so that sophisticated scientific research could
still be conducted. The question now is: If the university loses
its ability to control security, will it also lose its ability to
protect the laboratories' limited intellectual freedom?
</P>
<P>
   Richardson insisted that it would not, but said that the
scientists would simply have to cope because, as he put it, ``The
status quo isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do,'' Richardson said in an interview, ``is to
use what the University of California does best, and take away what
it doesn't do well, to enhance the overall management of the labs
and perhaps establish a pattern of joint ventures with the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're not punishing or scapegoating the University
of California. We want to use their strengths and eliminate their
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Drell, a professor emeritus of physics at Stanford
University and a member of the presidential commission that
criticized security at the government's nuclear labs last year, put
it more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful for me to say, because I'm one of those
scientists,'' Drell said, ``but I think the freedoms they had in
the past and the open attitude are unacceptable now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an even more basic concern. Many officials at Los
Alamos are girding for the possible indictment of some respected,
senior laboratory scientists on criminal charges for their
mishandling of the disappearance of the hard drives earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that this could not only harm the lab's already
substantial problems in recruiting young scientists but could cause
an exodus of senior scientists fearful of heavy-handed government
prosecutions. That fear has led some of those in charge at Los
Alamos to warn that any reductions in the University of
California's role should be prudent, thoughtful and modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that whatever appears to have broken can be fixed,''
said John C. Browne, the lab's director and a university employee.
``The benefits to the country of this relationship far outweigh the
problems. To me, if you go too far, it's like you're going to throw
away the whole system because of a couple of bad apples.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Richardson agreed, saying that dropping the
contract with the university and bringing in a private defense
contractor to run Los Alamos could be devastating. If a large
government defense contractor were to take over, Richardson said,
``then you would have an exodus from our labs.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials have expressed a willingness to negotiate a
new arrangement with the Department of Energy, but clearly the
institution's pride has been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds arrogant to say, but we don't need this relationship
for the university,'' said an official, echoing a common view. But
others say that, while eager to mend the partnership, they are
looking at possibly deeper changes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point when we separate is easy enough to identify,'' said
John Davies, a university regent and until recently the board's
chairman. ``It's the point when the security becomes so burdensome
that it drives the scientists out of the labs. For me, at this
point, though, I don't think we're anywhere near that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rulon Linford, a former lab scientist who is now the associate
vice provost for research and laboratory programs at the
university, said: ``I think the university gets out of the deal
what it has always gotten out of the deal. Its motivation is public
service. If the university walked, the national security of this
country would be harmed.''

</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the University of California system and
the government began informally in the early 1940s as the Manhattan
Project got under way, and it was first codified in 1943 with the
historic contract W-7405-Eng-36, which established the university's
management of the previously secret Los Alamos site.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the number of labs overseen by the university grew to
include Lawrence Berkeley as well as Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore. The Berkeley site is devoted to nonweapons research,
while the other two labs do both.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship, however, has traditionally been bumpy. The
scientists have always chafed under the government's security
restrictions. Also, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many university
faculty members objected to having an academic institution so
intimately involved in creating weapons of mass destruction. On
several occasions committees explored the relationship and drew up
alternatives, including separation.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1970s, as the research at Los Alamos expanded to
include the environment and energy, a consortium of Midwestern
universities asked for control of the labs to utilize this new
expertise. The proposal was rejected, but it led to other
examinations of the partnership and a series of changes throughout
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The university says the relationship has created little in the
way of financial rewards. Under the current five-year contract,
which expires in 2002, the university receives a series of fees,
some of which can expand or shrink, depending on performance.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is broken down into several components. There is a
payment of $11 million to cover several federal contracts, another
payment of $3.5 million to $4 million specifically to cover the
costs of a central administration office, and an administration
fee, adjusted to reflect performance, of roughly $14 million, but
it could go as high as $16 million. About half of those fees are
used to operate Los Alamos, with the rest used to pay for the other
two labs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some substantial benefits to the relationship for
the university.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory scientists are not like faculty members at
university campuses; they do not have tenure, they do not have
complete academic freedom and they must comply with a large body of
government rules. Also, none of the university employees at Los
Alamos are unionized, although some at the two California labs are.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship, however, is an important recruiting tool. Many
young scientists who might not be thrilled at the prospect of
working at a government lab devoted to building weapons of mass
destruction find the idea of being a University of California
researcher far more palatable. The relationship also means that
should a scientist decide to leave the lab, getting a job in
academia would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Xian Chen, a young biophysicist at Los Alamos
involved in nonweapons work, said the fact that he became a
university employee was critical. ``That's the reason I was
attracted,'' he said. ``Los Alamos has a good reputation in the
scientific world.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Los Alamos has some of the fastest computers in the
world and other sophisticated research equipment, all paid for by
the government. Weapons scientists can use some of these tools for
nonmilitary research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a one-way street,'' acknowledged Ronald A. Nelson,
the university's director for contract management. ``We get some of
the scientific results of those labs, and that reinforces our
reputation for excellence and prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are important financial incentives. The university
system offers a lucrative retirement package that some believe is
perhaps the single most important amenity offered. Also, children
of Los Alamos scientists can attend the university at the same
rates as California residents, a huge saving.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Gusterson, a professor of anthropology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, who is writing his second book on the
weapons labs, said he believed that the supposed intellectual
freedoms were a myth. Historically, Gusterson said, the university
had not stood up for scientists who angered the government, which
was certainly the case in the recent series of security lapses. But
the economic benefits, he maintained, had been crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retirement package is incredibly important,'' Gusterson
said. ``But it's my own view that the labs wouldn't be very
different without the University of California. They've been sort
of an absentee landlord. I think the UC element has always been
this little carrot the recruiters could dangle.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality now is that the priorities are changing, and
whatever protections the university could provide for the
scientists involved in sensitive research will be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present climate has already cost them young people,''
Drell said. ``The question is how we stop it and protect the
quality of the labs. The university is at its moment of truth in
standing up to this, and finding a way to make all this work. I
don't think the tensions are unreconcilable, but they are more
difficult.''

BUSH AND PATAKI DISCUSS VICE PRESIDENCY, BUT DOUBTS ARE PLENTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas met privately
Friday morning with Gov. George Pataki of New York to talk about
the vice presidency, and Republican officials with ties to Pataki's
office said that the hourlong discussion coincided with other signs
that Pataki is being looked at for a spot on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   None of these officials claimed that Pataki had emerged as the
front-runner in a selection process that has been shrouded in the
utmost secrecy, and others expressed skepticism that Bush would
choose him.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans said that aides to Pataki had spent much
of the last week reviewing his record and his past to assist with
the kind of intensive background check that prospective vice
presidential candidates typically undergo.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that Pataki's breakfast meeting with Bush, in a
hotel suite in Newark, N.J., where Bush was campaigning, came after
Pataki had received one of the questionnaires that the Bush
campaign distributed to possible running mates and after the New
York governor had spoken on the telephone several weeks ago with
Richard Cheney, the former defense secretary, who is supervising
the selection process for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, after both Bush and Pataki had addressed the New
York Conservative Party in Manhattan, they ate lunch together in a
hotel suite there, Republican officials said. These officials said
they did not know if the second meeting was private, or if it
concerned the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely been a kick-up of activity there,'' said
one Republican official, referring to communications between the
Bush campaign and Pataki's office.
</P>
<P>
   But other prominent Republican officials, some of them close to
Pataki, said that his chances would be hurt by his support for
abortion rights and his recently aggressive advocacy for gun
control. Those positions are not only at odds with the Texas
governor's but also inevitable points of contention with
conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   They also said there was no evidence that Pataki could help Bush
carry New York state, which is considered nearly a sure winner for
Vice President Al Gore. They said that Bush's meeting with Pataki
on Friday morning, which the Bush campaign made no effort to hide,
could simply have been a gesture intended to flatter Pataki and to
project the image that Bush was openminded about sharing the ticket
with a more moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it was done as theater,'' said one Republican
official who is close to Pataki. ``Nobody in Austin is talking
about Pataki. And they're not going to take the risk of picking a
pro-choice governor and having the convention become all about
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, confirmed that
Bush and Pataki talked about the vice presidency Friday morning,
but did not provide details. Until now, Pataki's name had been
mostly absent from Republican officials' speculation. Other names
that have been mentioned frequently include Gov. Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, Sens. Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, Sen.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Elizabeth Dole and, more recently, Gov.
James S. Gilmore III of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also campaigned frequently and spoken privately with
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a close friend. But many Republican
officials and political analysts say that Ridge and Pataki will
ultimately be passed over because of their support for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But a Republican official with close ties to Pataki's office
said that the party was so solidly behind Bush that he might be
able to afford the choice of Ridge or Pataki, and that Pataki was
the less controversial of the two. Unlike Ridge, the official
noted, Pataki had not been drawn into bitter disputes with the
Catholic leaders in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, a senior adviser to Pataki, said Friday that ``the
governor has not and will not talk about any private conversations
he may or may not have had with Governor Bush.'' And Bush and
Pataki, in their remarks to the Conservative Party, simply made
clear that they shared a friendship and a mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world of George Pataki,'' said Bush, who attended
Yale University at the same time as Pataki and became governor of
Texas the same year that Pataki became governor of New York. ``He's
a really good man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Bush added, ``the second-best thing that happened
in 1994, in November of 1994, was watching the New York returns
come in.''

</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Computers
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 86-11, a measure to relax
export restrictions on high-performance computers. The provision
would decrease the period Congress has to review administration
changes in computer export controls from 180 to 60 days. Supporters
said it would help American manufactures. Opponents said it would
allow American systems to be used against the nation. A ``yes''
vote supports the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: RU-486
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday rejected, 182-187, a measure to bar the Food
and Drug Administration from examining, developing or approving
chemicals intended to induce abortions. An amendment to the FDA
appropriations bill, the provision would have restricted testing on
the drug Mifepristone or RU-486. Supporters said it would have
protected women and children. Opponents said it would have
interfered with the ability of women to make health-related
decisions. A ``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: Abroad
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 363-12, an amendment to the Food
and Drug Administration spending bill that would prohibit the
agency from enforcing restrictions on traveling abroad to purchase
prescription drugs. Supporters cited the high cost of drugs in the
United States. Opponents said the provision would prevent the FDA
from stopping counterfeit drugs. A ``yes'' vote supports the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: Agricultue
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 339-82, a $75.3 billion
appropriations bill for food, farm and drug programs. Supporters
said it would aid farmers. Opponents said it would not provide
enough for nutrition programs and environmental protections. A
``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: Marriage
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 269-159, a bill to reduce the
marriage tax penalty. The bill would increase the standard
deduction for married couples, cutting $182.3 billion in taxes over
10 years. Supporters said it would require married Americans to pay
equitable levels of taxes. Opponents said it would benefit only the
wealthy. A ``yes'' supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: Debt
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 216-211, a measure to forgive
$225 million of debt from poor nations. The provision is the
amendment to a foreign appropriations bill. Supporters said it
would stabilize Third World governments. Opponents said the
provision would limit international military training and
assistance. A ``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: AIDS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 267-156, a measure to add $42
million to international AIDS funding. The provision is an
amendment to the foreign appropriations bill. Supporters said it
would slow the spread of AIDS. Opponents said the provision would
limit international military training and assistance. A ``yes''
vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   7) BILL NUMBER: Foreign
</P>
<P>
   The House on thursday approved, 239-185, a $13.3 billion
appropriations bill to provide international aid for military
training, debt relief and AIDS programs. Supporters said it would
provide needed foreign assistance. Opponents said it would fall
short of the President's proposal, underfunding international
programs such as the Peace Corps. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.

 BUSH DEFENDS DEATH PENALTY TO RELIGIOUS AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of George W. Bush's campaign events unexpectedly turned into
a debate over the death penalty on Friday, when a black minister
raised questions about the governor's compassion and told him that
a recent execution in Texas was ``not a moral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise exchange, in what is usually a highly scripted
campaign, took place at a Presbyterian meeting hall in Elizabeth,
N.J., where Bush had gone to highlight his belief in using
religious institutions to provide social services.
</P>
<P>
   The presumed Republican presidential nominee sat with a mostly
black and Hispanic panel of church leaders, community organizers
and local officials, who had been assembled by his campaign to
discuss how churches provide services. But halfway through the
event, the Rev. Joseph H. Garlic, seated immediately to Bush's
right, changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had to ask a sensitive question. ``It is one I could
not live with myself if I did not ask or bring up,'' he said, ``and
that's about Gary Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had been convicted for the 1981 murder of a man
outside a Houston supermarket, was executed in Texas last month,
with Bush proclaiming that ``justice is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the questions that swirled around the case,
including the competence of Graham's lawyer and the fact that only
one witness testified against Graham, Garlic said the case had
given Bush ``an opportunity to show some compassion and love in a
way that had not been shown before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when you chose protocol and not setting a
precedent over a decision about a man's life,'' Garlic said, ``you
missed an opportunity to show some of this compassion, and to show
some of this new Republican spirit that you talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I must differ on the death penalty,'' a surprised Bush
replied, speaking softly. ``I support it because I think it saves
lives when it's administered fairly and justly and surely.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My job is to uphold the laws of my state. That's
what I was sworn in to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said of his refusal to intervene in the execution, ``It's
not an easy decision to make, as I'm sure you can understand.'' He
added, ``But it isn't a political decision for me, Reverend.'' He
said he would continue to ``uphold the law'' and ``if it costs me
votes, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied, Garlic persisted. ``With all due respect, sir,
that is not an answer,'' he said. ``That is not a good enough
answer for me.'' He said the issue was whether Graham was guilty.
``And while you say to me that it was not a political decision, it
definitely was not a moral decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just disagree on that case,'' Bush said, and the group
returned to talking about services for children and to a proposal
by him for a $400 million program to help lower-income parents pay
for after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a concerted effort throughout his campaign to
prove he is a ``different kind of Republican,'' by appearing in
minority neighborhoods. He began his week at the convention of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And he
told the small crowd of guests on Friday that he hoped his
appearance before the civil rights organization would cause black
voters to think, ``Hey, there might be a little different cut to
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many Republican presidential candidates have
come to this neighborhood before,'' he said. ``I hope it tells
people I care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the end of the event he had the crowd laughing, when he
raised the question of whether he would remember his visit. ``I
think it's safe to say I might,'' Bush said with a smile. Then the
governor turned to Garlic, former director of the the Elizabethport
Presbyterian Center, where Bush spoke, and shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though Garlic said afterward that he ``was absolutely not''
satisfied by Bush's response, he said Bush ``handled himself very
well in the total situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several others in the audience said the governor had left them
more comfortable with the idea of a Bush presidency and even
willing to consider voting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little bit more down to earth than I thought,'' said
William Ward, a member of the center's board. ``He's more
impressive than I thought. Now I've got to listen to the other
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a sense of humor,'' said Vera Atkinson, an assistant
director of an organization that builds low-income housing in the
neighborhood. ``I thought he was uncomfortable but answered the
best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Bush traveled to more traditional Republican
turf _ a reception of New York's Conservative Party in a New York
City hotel ballroom. But the Gary Graham issue followed him, as two
protesters rose in the back of the room and began chanting. They
were quickly evicted.

 &HT;    Jury delivers record setting verdict in tobacco trial
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The ``day of reckoning'' sought for years by cancer- and
emphysema-ravaged Florida smokers arrived Friday in a packed
courtroom as a jury slammed the tobacco industry with a
record-shattering $145 billion punitive damages verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco lawyers vowed to put years of appeals and legal
roadblocks between Friday's verdict and any payday for sick
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated less than five hours before arriving at the
largest civil verdict in U.S. history. The trial lasted nearly two
years and was the nation's first smokers' class-action trial to
come before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day of reckoning,'' proclaimed Stanley Rosenblatt,
the attorney for an estimated 300,000 to 700,000 Floridians with
smoking-related illnesses. Rosenblatt urged a multibillion-dollar
penalty to punish tobacco companies for decades of misleading the
public about the health risks of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco lawyers blasted the award as excessive and the trial as
legally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably not a country in the world that can withstand
a verdict of this size and pay it at one time,'' said Dan Webb, the
attorney for industry leader Philip Morris, which was socked with a
$73.96 billion penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is roughly seven times larger than the previous U.S.
record, a $22 billion award by a Hawaiian jury in 1996 against the
estate of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. That award
was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Kaye can reduce Friday's verdict if he finds it
excessive. Florida law forbids a punitive damages award that would
bankrupt a business.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, when he was first handed the verdict, appeared stunned by
its scale. He slowly leafed through the thick packet of pages
detailing the award, then placed his left hand over his mouth and
exhaled. Ten seconds passed and the hushed crowd in the courtroom
watched as Kaye fumbled with the papers.
</P>
<P>
   After the wait, Kaye muttered, ``I will publish this verdict.''
But he stopped short, raised his right index finger to the jury,
smiled, and said: ``Wait. Before I do that, let me think on this
for just a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrowing his brow, Kaye waited five more seconds before his
deliberate reading of the damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the verdict, Kaye said, ``A lot of zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   The five tobacco companies that were sued in the case claimed a
combined net worth of $15.2 billion and said they could not afford
to pay more than $381 million in damages _ less than 1 percent of
the amount jurors awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco lawyers noted Friday that about two dozen other state
and federal courts have rejected similar class-action suits,
generally saying the smokers' histories and awareness of risk were
too varied to be tried in a single case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been heard of in American history to do anything
like this . . . This should not happen in an American courtroom,''
Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every court in this country has ruled that these
types of cases . . . should not be litigated as one huge,
consolidated case,'' said Lorillard general counsel Ron Milstein,
who vowed to appeal the $16.25 billion penalty against his company.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds lawyer Jim Johnson, whose company was ordered to
pay $36.28 billion in damages, blasted the proceeding as a ``show
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Friday's verdict is upheld, tobacco lawyers said they
don't expect to part with damages money in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that day will come for decades,'' said Webb,
who maintains that the hundreds of thousands of smokers in the
class must go through separate trials before collecting damages.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt called that argument ``an absurdity'' and the
industry's complaints in general as ``sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they got tagged. Finally they got hit. The day of
reckoning was delayed in coming and they should just take it,''
Rosenblatt said. ``I don't think two years of hard work by a
dedicated judge and a dedicated jury will be thrown down the drain
by some technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's verdict, Philip Morris share prices closed at
$24.69, down 31 cents on the day, while shares of RJ Reynolds
closed at $26.19, down 94 cents. British American Tobacco
Industries, parent of Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, closed at $12.50,
down 25 cents. Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard Tobacco, closed at
$63.06, down 44 cents. Vector, parent of Liggett Group, Inc.,
closed at $14.44, down 44 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in 1994 and went to trial in 1998. The same
jurors who returned Friday's verdict decided last year that the
tobacco industry conspired to conceal the deadliness and
addictiveness of cigarettes. In the trial's second phase, the
jurors in April awarded $12.7 million in compensatory damages to
two smokers with cancer and the widower of a third.
</P>
<P>
   One of the compensatory damages recipients, Orlando clockmaker
Frank Amodeo, hugged Rosenblatt after Kaye read the jury's numbers
to a hushed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only about money. It's about justice,'' said Amodeo,
whose throat cancer forces him to eat and drink through a tube in
his stomach. ``There's no amount of money in the world that's going
to change the way I eat or drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Farnan, who also was awarded compensatory damages in April,
tearfully said jurors ``should be commended by this whole country''
for Friday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   After their verdict was read, Kaye encouraged jurors not to
publicly discuss the reasoning behind their verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've done here is your own private business. Nobody can
question it. Nobody should,'' said Kaye, who arranged for the
jurors to be whisked from the courthouse before reporters could
question them.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, who asked for $154 billion in damages and said any
substantial reduction would be ``a crushing blow to public
health,'' praised jurors for their verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six thoughtful, courageous Americans listened quietly and
carefully to testimony for close to two years,'' Rosenblatt said.
``And, dammit, they did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the decision ``an obscene
symptom of a court system that is out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trial lawyers have subverted the legal system for their own
financial gain,'' said Bruce Josten, Chamber executive vice
president. ``Legitimate, but politically out-of-favor businesses
have been attacked by attorneys driven by the prospect of absurd
punitive damage awards.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-smoking advocates also heralded Friday's verdict. Even
if the punitive damages are reduced, Northeastern University law
professor Richard Daynard said the verdict will shake the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a tremendous landmark,'' said Daynard, who chairs
the Tobacco Products Liability Project. ``There's no question, this
is going to force the tobacco companies one way or another to
change the way they do business.''

COMMENTARY: TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. _ Tom Wolfe set some of his last novel near here,
but even he couldn't make this scene up:
</P>
<P>
   In the packed, sweltering living room of the tiny house that
serves as the Dylan Glenn for Congress headquarters, a Louis
Farrakhan acolyte is brandishing The Final Call, the Nation of
Islam newspaper, and ranting about a Washington conspiracy to rob
Georgia's peanut farmers. Listening to him are a couple of dozen
angry and weather-beaten black farmers, lifelong Democrats, as well
as Glenn, who wants their vote. Looking down on them all is a regal
poster-size photograph of a starchy Barbara Bush, replete with
pearls _ but it's not there as a gag. Glenn is a 31-year-old black
Republican, an unabashed George W. Bush cheerleader, who believes
he can be elected to Congress by a white-majority district that has
never sent any Republican to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first Black Muslim I've ever seen in southwest
Georgia,'' the candidate muses after the meeting, in which he seems
to win over his audience, Muslim included, just as I'd seen him win
over the all-white staff of a small local telecom business a few
hours earlier. Such cross-cultural incongruities abound in Glenn's
race: His campaign coordinator, Lizanne Clay, is a white Jewish
Democrat gung-ho for Al Gore. The district itself, Georgia's 2nd,
is one big anomaly. Because Glenn's opponent, the Democratic
congressman Sanford Bishop, is also black, this is that rare
white-majority district in the South, let alone the country, that
offers no white choice in its House race. ``The race card is more
or less removed from the table,'' says Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The district is also unusual in having missed out entirely on
the New Economy that has showered spectacular growth on Atlanta,
150 miles and a world away. Though Georgia's 2nd encompasses some
of the South's most spectacular old hunting plantations _ the
prototypes for the fictional spread owned by the hero of Wolfe's
``A Man in Full'' _ it is among the nation's poorest precincts. The
poverty level in some of its 31 counties is three times the
national average, and unemployment in Albany, the largest town
(pop. 80,000), nears 8 percent. Functional illiteracy levels
approach 40 percent in some counties _ giving the local chain
outlet's midnight party for Harry Potter a special poignancy. While
Jimmy Carter may still live in Plains, young people flee faster
than such past native sons as Ray Charles and Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty, deserted storefronts are common; billboards heralding
dot-coms are absent. Clay, a fourth-generation ``Albanian,'' doubts
her own daughter will return after college. ``It's like a Third
World country down here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So what's an ambitious young black middle-class Republican doing
in a place like this?
</P>
<P>
   I first met Dylan Glenn a few months ago and was curious to
watch him for a simple reason: If Bush's ``compassionate
conservatism'' is more than a campaign slogan, it must reside in
someone like Glenn, a smart candidate blessed with charisma and a
sense of humor who is taking on a seemingly quixotic political
mission. No black Republican has ever defeated a black Democrat in
a modern congressional race; his opponent is a formidable incumbent
whom Glenn himself regards as ``a decent man.'' As Glenn's
strategist, Ron Jensen, explains, Glenn can win only by holding on
to the all-white GOP base (with no defections from any racists who
might want to abstain altogether), peeling off some conservative
white Democrats and, most crucially, winning some 15 percent of the
heretofore monolithically black Democratic vote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   If the potential crossover black Democrats I met are any
indication, they won't leap easily. One such Glenn enthusiast, a
71-year-old county commissioner and '60s civil-rights veteran named
James Mays, regards both George W. Bush and his father as among
``the most evil people in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who was a young aide in President Bush's White House,
hammers in the George W. message _ the classic Republican mantra of
``growth, lower taxes, opportunity, individual responsibility,
jobs.'' In essence, he sands down any ideology beyond a faith in
free enterprise. The son of educators, he presents himself as an
educational reformer and as an energetic, well-connected rainmaker
more likely than Bishop to attract new businesses to an area in
desperate need. Like the Texas governor in his address before the
NAACP this week, Glenn doesn't pretend that his party has a
distinguished record with minorities. ``There's a perception that
the Republican Party is intolerant _ against immigrants, gays,
blacks,'' he says, ``and we play into that.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly. In primary season, Bush and John McCain both
lacked the courage to take on South Carolina's Confederate flag.
Last month Colin Powell, who is a Glenn contributor, went on Fox to
say that the GOP is ``certainly not seen as the black guy's party''
and to dissent strongly from its opposition to affirmative action.
This week the Bush campaign made light of a Washington Post
reporter who dared bring up the hard-line white supremacist past of
its ally Strom Thurmond. Meanwhile, even as Bush appeared before
the NAACP, the news media feasted on a 1996 photo of a Republican
governor, Christie Whitman, broadly grinning while frisking a black
man. Whatever Whitman's intentions, the image was a bizarre echo of
antebellum porn.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the white compassionate conservatives in his party, Glenn
can speak with some moral authority. He is a sharecropper's
grandson and the great-grandson of emancipated slaves. When
pressed, he can cite instances of experiencing discrimination, and
he recalls being the sole black person at a White House meeting a
decade ago where he had to speak up to challenge other Bushites'
derisive views of welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In between campaign stops that ranged from a diesel-scented drag
strip populated equally by blacks and whites to a watermelon
festival parade in Cordele (``Watermelon Capital of the World''), I
asked Glenn if the latent, tentative GOP embrace of minorities is
more spin than action, more election-year packaging than substance.
He unsurprisingly asserted that Bush is ``100 percent sincere'' and
is intent on moving beyond the ``outreach programs and window
dressing'' that have often constituted the GOP's attempt to woo
minorities. ``I know the party isn't seen as motivated by the right
reasons,'' he adds. ``It's seen as the party of the rich, white
country club and doesn't have a lot of credibility.'' He argues
that if he can bring economic relief to those left behind in
Clinton-era prosperity he can help turn the page. As the first
black Republican elected to Congress from a Confederate state since
1901, he would certainly be a highly watched test case of whether
there can be results to back up his party's compassionate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Glenn wins or not, there's no doubt he is on the edge of
a generational shift. The Albany area was the site of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s biggest, and legendary, defeat on the road
to Montgomery. It's where a sheriff told The New York Times
reporter Claude Sitton, in a famous 1962 front-page story, ``We
want our colored people to go on living like they have for the last
hundred years.'' But while such events may have helped forge
Glenn's opponent _ who, as Morehouse College student president,
sang at King's funeral in 1968 _ they happened before Glenn was
born. Now they are history: The Albany Movement is documented in a
new museum at the old Mount Zion Baptist Church, once the site of
overflow civil-rights rallies led by the Freedom Singers, but today
a quiet refuge in a somnolent town segregated in its entirety from
the American boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation and younger didn't live through the civil-rights
movement,'' says Glenn. ``We know and understand it and respect
what it did, but we want to go on to the next step.'' If the
Republican Party is really to be a credible part of that next step,
it will not be enough for its presidential candidate to pose
incessantly with black schoolchildren and boast about his
``heart.'' It will need someone like Dylan Glenn to make good on
his promise to lift up both black and white Americans in a patch of
the country as ripe for change as this.

FAKE JEB BUSH LETTER USED IN FIGHTING BILL TO CURB WEB GAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Conn., Texas)  By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida authorities are investigating a letter
purportedly from Gov. Jeb Bush to a Florida member of Congress that
the governor's office says is a forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which claims to detail Bush's position on
legislation now before Congress to ban gambling on the Internet,
was addressed to Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., and dated June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says Bush is opposed to the bill on the grounds that
it would prevent the state from selling lottery tickets online and
would infringe on states' rights. The document has been circulating
on Capitol Hill for the past several days and has been used by
opponents of the measure as an argument for its defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter is a forgery, Bush's office said Friday. ``We
don't know where it came from,'' said Justin Sayfie, Bush's
communications director. ``It is not his position. It is not the
governor's signature. It is not his letter. It is not authorized.
And it is troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayfie said that Bush had taken no position on the bill. Neither
has Gov. George W. Bush of Texas taken no position on the bill, an
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the letter became clear late Friday, although its
authorship remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   An official of Shandwick Washington, the Washington subsidiary
of Shandwick International, a major public relations firm based in
London, contacted Bush's office last month to request a letter
stating Bush's position on the gambling legislation, said Mark Day,
a Shandwick spokesman. Shandwick requested that the letter be
addressed to a member of Congress, Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick represents eLottery Inc., a Connecticut company that
provides computerized services for state lotteries and would profit
from online sales of lottery tickets. The Internet gambling
legislation would prohibit sales of lottery ticket on the Internet;
it is opposed by eLottery and several other lottery vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick said it had hoped to get a letter from Bush stating
his opposition to the bill _ as they had from several other
governors _ because it would inhibit electronic sales of lottery
tickets and infringe on states' rights. Day said that Shandwick
received the letter in late June and immediately began circulating
it on Capitol Hill, hoping to generate opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We requested of Governor Bush's office and received a copy of
a letter to members of Congress, which we had every reason to
believe originated in the governor's office,'' Day said. ``It
appeared to be on official stationery and contained what appeared
to be an official signature. We later learned that the governor's
office did not authorize the letter and disavowed it. We
immediately stopped using the letter and urged others to do the
same. If there's a problem with the letter we believe absolutely we
should get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Degliomini, senior vice president of sales and
marketing at eLottery, referred questions about the matter to John
M. Haddow, partner in the Washington lobbying firm Symms &AMP; Haddow
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Haddow said that he and eLottery officials were angry about the
letter and ``furiously trying to find out the source of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously not a valid letter,'' Haddow said. ``I can't
tell you how much this annoys me and my partner.'' Haddow's partner
is Steven Symms, a former Republican senator from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to come before the House for a vote next
week. The measure seeks to curb the growth of wagering on the
Internet, particularly on casino-style games and sports. Many
governors oppose the bill because it would deny them the option of
selling lottery ticket online. It is supported by state attorneys
general, major professional and collegiate sports leagues, family
organizations and the Nevada gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns said in a statement that he never saw the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and my staff do not recall receiving a letter addressed to
me dated June 23, 2000, from the governor of Florida, Jeb Bush,
expressing his opposition'' to the Internet gambling bill, Stearns
said. ``If such a letter had been received, it certainly would have
been brought to my attention. However, at this time only the
governor's office can comment on the authenticity of this letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayfie said that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was
investigating the letter. ``Hopefully, we'll get to the bottom of
this,'' he said.

 &HT;    Cox acquires area papers
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Cox Newspapers, publisher of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and the Dayton Daily News, expanded its reach
across southwestern Ohio Friday by acquiring daily newspapers in
Middletown and Hamilton and several non-dailies, including papers
in Miamisburg, Germantown and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Cox acquired the Middletown Journal and the Journal-News in
Hamilton, plus 10 weeklies, from Thomson Newspapers, a unit of
Toronto-based Thomson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The non-daily newspapers include the Miamisburg News and West
Carrollton News, the Germantown Press and the Lebanon Western Star,
plus the Oxford Press, Fairfield Echo, Franklin Chronicle,
Springboro Star Press, Today's Express in Morrow and the Monroe
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction also included several niche publications and a
printing plant in Butler County.
</P>
<P>
   The various publications have 350 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase follows the announcement last month that Thomson
had sold these publications and certain others across the U.S. to
the Gannett Co. Inc., Arlington, Va., for $1.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cox held a right of first refusal in future Thomson
transactions when it negotiated a newspaper swap in 1996 that gave
Cox two newspapers in North Carolina and Thomson two Cox newspapers
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett is proceeding with the purchase of 19 Thomson dailies
and 23 non-dailies in central Ohio, Louisiana, Maryland, Wisconsin
and Utah for approximately $1.035 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises,
did not disclose the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   However, based on what the publicly traded Gannett Co.
acknowledges paying for the other Thomson publications, the price
is approximately $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pending regulatory approvals, Cox expects the deal to close in
the third quarter, according to J. Bradford Tillson, president and
chief executive of Cox Ohio Publishing and publisher of the Dayton
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Tillson noted that the acquisitions are Cox's second major
investment in Cox Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently spent $90 million on the Dayton Daily News
Print Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   The investments represent a powerful vote of confidence in the
future of newspapers in southwest Ohio, and in the strength of the
Cox Ohio team of employees, Tillson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with Carl Esposito, the Thomson
executive in charge of southwest Ohio properties, to ensure an
orderly transition of the properties and their employees from
Thomson to Cox,'' Tillson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to achieve the highest level of service to our
customers during and after this transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite TV's importance and the growing use of the Internet,
newspapers remain a major force for delivering news and
information, Tillson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers are still the biggest mass media in the country in
terms of reach and advertising dollars,'' Tillson said. ``Cox
believes they will continue to be strong in the future. That's not
to say that the Internet is not going to come in and grow, but Cox
believes in newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillson said there is no plan to combine any Cox newspapers or
their sections with the Thomson publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought them because we think they are good properties,
period. Once the deal is closed, we're going to go in and learn a
lot more about the Thomson operation and the Thomson newspapers.
Working with them, we'll look for ways down the line that we can
grow our revenues and market share. But we don't have any plans to
combine anything at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of serving advertisers, bigger is better to some
extent, Tillson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have under the Cox Ohio group daily newspapers with
circulation of close to 300,000. Obviously, for some advertisers,
that will be very attractive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the perfect end to a day of swimming, relay
races and folk singing at summer day camp in the Rockland County
woods, north of New York City: a Hawaiian luau with hamburgers,
pineapple slices and inflatable palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the beginning. The campers were looking
forward to campfires and s'mores for the one night that they were
to spend without their moms, dads, brothers and sisters, or teddy
bears too big to squeeze into knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   So the 140 children, ages 7 to 10, piled into five buses with
their sleeping bags _ and rode into Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the camp experience in the age of the mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in at least a decade when the skies were
clear, Manhattan's 92nd Street Y camp's fabled overnight under the
stars would take place indoors in Manhattan instead of at the Henry
Kaufmann campground in Pearl River, N.Y. Instead of a campfire,
there would be a circle of flashlights. The s'mores would be made
with marshmallow fluff.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Y said that out of concern for the safety of
the children and parents' fears about the West Nile virus, they did
not want campers exposed to mosquitoes during the active feeding
hours between dusk and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at a time when danger lurks in the form of disease-bearing
pests and litigious parents, camp operators are becoming more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're dealing with the outdoors, we're dealing with ticks
and we're dealing with mosquitoes and we're dealing with bats,''
said Peg Smith, the executive director American Camping
Association, based in Indianapolis. ``I think everybody's more
conscious today. Clearly everybody is living in that world that
tends to be concerned about lawsuits. But what we're most concerned
about is the safety of children going to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she did not know of any other camps in the country
that had eliminated outdoor camping. The fears over West Nile are a
local phenomenon, and so far this year, no one in the New York
region is known to have become infected.
</P>
<P>
   For the children at Camp Yomi, the only day camp sponsored by
the 92nd Street Y that features an overnight camp out in Rockland
County, safety meant sleeping indoors in the Y building on
Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The campers found themselves sitting atop hardwood floors in a
dance studio, smearing marshmallow fluff on graham crackers. When
it was time for the nighttime story, they assembled into a rough
circle, around a campfire fashioned from small blue flashlights.
</P>
<P>
   And at night, they padded down the hall to the bathroom and back
to the classrooms where the carpeting was covered by a wall-to-wall
patchwork of sleeping bags. After a few tears were wiped away and
several campers had phoned home for a reassuring good night,
post-lights-out giggles reverberated from plaster walls instead of
disappearing into the stars and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Katz, 10, was not impressed with the alternate
arrangements. ``I live in the city, and it's just all the stars you
see'' at the camp in the woods, she said. The Yomi campout last
year ``was much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people brought junk food,'' she said wistfully. ``It
was just that we liked the stories they told and everything _ it
was just a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Marissa had her own solution to the mosquito problem. ``I'm
trying my best to catch them and kill them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the West Nile virus, the Camp Yomi kids'
awareness spanned from blissfully in the dark to surprisingly
plugged in. Some are anxious, others fearless.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Gilbert, 8, did not claim to be fearless, but nor did she
reserve her antipathy for the carriers of the ``Western disease,''
as she called it. ``I'm scared of all bugs,'' Molly announced,
twisting a red and purple lanyard.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Saltz, the director of the 92nd Street Y's many camp
programs, said he wanted the campers to have the experience of
dealing with their fears in the woods. He recalled his own
childhood summers sleeping on tarps beneath the open sky at the
same Henry Kaufmann campground, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole trend in parenting that I've seen in my 10
years here, that I'd call micromanaging,'' he said, adding, ``It's
hard to imagine my folks getting worried about these kinds of
things. I just think the world has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saltz ultimately decided to err on the side of caution after
consulting with the Rockland County health department. Six of the
10 crows infected by the West Nile virus in the New York region
this year were discovered in the county. He said the fear of
lawsuits did not figure into his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of
Health, said the 92nd Street Y's move was a ``prudent precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not telling any overnight camps that they shouldn't be
in business,'' Smith said. ``We're telling them what the risks are
and what the personal prevention measures are that could be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent said she was glad Saltz took the initiative. Juggling
the responsibilities, concerns and errands of child rearing, she
said she forgot even to worry about West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling bad that I really haven't thought about it,'' said
Diana Rodriguez, who arrived at the Y just before the buses left
for Henry Kaufmann to drop off the in-line skates that her son
Joshua Flores, 9, left behind. ``You hear about it, but I don't
have any connection with anyone who's had it,'' Rodriguez said.

EXPERTS PLAY DOWN ABM TEST FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second straight failure of a test for the proposed national
missile shield has set off a barrage of criticism. But such
breakdowns are routine in ambitious rocketry programs, even ones
that eventually succeed, several military and industry experts
outside the Pentagon say.
</P>
<P>
   The comments suggest that in the long run, a much larger
challenge to the program will come from critics who say that no
matter how well the shield eventually performs in the tightly
controlled tests, it will be all but worthless in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly the case that they'll be able to make this system
work against a simple, laboratory-designed threat,'' said Dr.
Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who
specializes in military policy. ``These failures someday will end.
However, it doesn't mean it can defeat a real-world threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doubts about the shield are based on the contention that
decoys could always confuse an interceptor to let a warhead slip
through. For their part, officials in the antimissile program
maintain that the system can sift through the decoys.
</P>
<P>
   But among technically knowledgeable observers on all sides of
the debate, there is a remarkable range of agreement that the
shield's fattest target for criticism at the moment _ the generally
low-tech breakdowns that have caused the test failures _ say little
about whether the program will eventually succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every program has gone through failures,'' said Louis Deeter
of Quantum Research International in Huntsville, Ala., a retired
colonel who for three years was government program manager of the
Army's theater high-altitude area defense, or THAAD, antimissile
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything, today, that says the system
won't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the test last week, a modified Minuteman rocket topped by a
so-called kill vehicle was launched into space from Kwajalein Atoll
in the Pacific Ocean. With the help of radar and satellite data and
its own sensors, the kill vehicle was supposed to fire its
thrusters and guide itself into a collision with a mock warhead,
pulverizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the final stage of the two-stage rocket began tumbling,
and then the simple mechanism that was supposed to release the kill
vehicle from the booster did not function properly, said Lt. Col.
Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new technology,'' Lehner said. ``There has never
been a problem with that particular technology.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Pentagon analysts were examining second-by-second
telemetry data from the flight to determine exactly what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous test, last January, the kill vehicle separated
properly from the booster. But the vehicle missed the target
because a cooling line clogged, shutting down its heat-seeking
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   And in October, the Pentagon described the system's first
intercept test a complete success, but later was forced to concede
that the kill vehicle had drifted off course and locked onto a
decoy balloon. It turned out that the kill vehicle's navigation
system had been loaded with an incorrect star chart, and that the
guidance system suffered from a drift.
</P>
<P>
   Those failures were similar to the basic mechanical breakdowns,
electrical shorts and software flaws that led to a spate of recent
failures in launchings of commercial booster rockets for lifting
satellites into space and in the test program for THAAD, which is a
less ambitious antimissile system that is meant to protect troops.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in April, during a string of six failed launchings
in nine months, a protective shroud covering a payload failed to
detach from a Lockheed Martin Athena 2 rocket, dragging an
earth-imaging satellite back into the atmosphere, much as the
Minuteman did with the kill vehicle last week.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, one of six consecutive misses by THAAD was
apparently caused by particulate contamination of its seeker eye, a
problem similar to the one that derailed the national missile
defense test in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch business is absolutely unforgiving,'' said John
Willacker, vice president for space launching operations at the
Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., who was involved in several
critical reviews of the booster program.
</P>
<P>
   But after what Willacker called a ``return to fundamentals''
involving management changes and redoubled quality-control
procedures, the booster program returned to flawless launchings.
</P>
<P>
   The THAAD program followed its heavily criticized failures with
two hits last year after a reorganization of the testing program
and extensive analysis of the problems. Earlier missile and
antimissile programs, with names like Sprint, Patriot and Polaris,
had similar histories of repeated failure followed by success, at
least in controlled tests.
</P>
<P>
   David Mosher, a policy analyst at the Rand Corp. who specializes
in nuclear weapons and missile defense, said the national missile
shield would ``need a couple more good failures'' before the crisis
atmosphere that surrounded the THAAD misses could be expected to
set in. But he added, ``This is a hard thing to do, and you should
expect failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehner said that pending the Pentagon's investigation of the
miss last week, the system's next test is expected to take place in
October or November.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts cautioned that whatever the technical relevance of
the problems, another miss would exact a steep price in political
criticism of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall program has not tested successfully,'' said Janne
Nolan, director of International Programs of the Century
Foundation, who sits on the Defense Policy Board, which advises the
Pentagon. Until it does, she warned, ``there's no there there.''

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A five-member advisory jury on Friday cleared
federal agents of any wrongdoing in the fiery deaths of some 80
Branch Davidians near Waco, a decision that government attorneys
said should end a 7-year-old controversy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. is expected to issue the
final verdict next month in the $675 million wrongful death
lawsuit, but the lead attorney for the Davidians indicated that he
may be finished with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be resolved is whether FBI agents fired into the sect
headquarters on April 19, 1993, the day the 51-day standoff ended
in a fatal fire. Smith has tentatively set Aug. 2 to hear
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for 2 1/2 hours on Friday before issuing
its finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is vindication for the law-enforcement officers
who were out at Mount Carmel doing their jobs under very difficult
circumstances, very dangerous circumstances,'' said U.S. Attorney
Michael Bradford, who represented the government in the month-long
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the decision proves that sect leader David Koresh
and the Davidians were responsible for the April 19, 1993, tragedy
at Mount Carmel, the name of the sect's complex about 10 miles
outside of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, lead attorney for the Davidians and their
families, said he has spent more than a million dollars on the case
and may drop the allegation against the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in pursuing lost causes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions from survivors and relatives of the Davidians killed
at Mount Carmel included disappointment, bitterness and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it wasn't a fair trial. I said that before it
started,'' said Clive Doyle, 59, an Australian-born Davidian who
escaped from the fire, with burns. His 18-year-old daughter was
among those who died.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle described his reaction to the decision as ``ho-hum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been surprised if the jury and the judge had
ruled in our favor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his efforts to make new evidence against the government
public, Caddell said he fears that the focus will be solely on the
jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of the American people will take
this as the final word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell predicted that the jury's decision might influence
former Sen. John Danforth's independent investigation of the events
at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Danforth, who was appointed in September by
Attorney General Janet Reno, told The Associated Press that he
would not comment on the jury's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys James Brannon of Houston and former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark joined Caddell in trying to prove that 75 agents from
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fired indiscriminately
in a gun battle that broke out when they tried to serve a search
warrant at Mount Carmel on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Brannon and Clark left without comment.
</P>
<P>
   The raid left four ATF agents and six Davidians dead.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, during closing arguments, pointed to testimony from some
of the ATF agents, saying they fired at windows from where they
believed the shots were coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't see anybody; they just shot,'' Clark said. ``If
that's not indiscriminate, what is indiscriminate?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plaintiffs' closing argument appealed to the jurors'
emotions. Clark described sect members as peaceful church people;
Brannon showed photographs of three babies killed in the fire; and
Caddell read aloud part of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury found that ATF did not act inappropriately and that
the FBI, which took over after the botched raid, was not negligent
April 19. Smith asked the jury to determine whether the FBI was
negligent in any of three ways: by using tanks to destroy part of
the sect's building; by starting or contributing to a fire that
raced through it; and by failing to have a firefighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of about 80 Branch Davidians were found
after the fire was doused, although the actual number remains in
dispute. Autopsies, some of which were performed by Tarrant County
Medical Examiner Nizam Peerwani, show that the majority died by
smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen died of gunshot wounds consistent with suicide and a
few suffocated or died of blunt trauma, the reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the government never presented testimony to counter
the Davidians' fire investigation expert, Pat Kennedy, who said the
government helped at least spread the fire by using tanks to insert
tear gas directly into the sect's living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you destroy a building, you make kindling,'' Caddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government presented secretly-recorded tapes from April 19
that voice engineers said captured Davidians discussing their
efforts to spread fuel and then light a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, David Koresh and the Branch Davidians were responsible
for that tragedy, as well,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvelyn Cooney, 48, whose sister Jaydean Wendel was fatally
shot during the initial raid as she combed her child's hair,
praised the jury and the Davidians' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the verdict could have been different, but I admire
everyone who tried to bring justice,'' Cooney said from Spokane,
Wash., where she cares for her sister's four children.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the jurors, whose names were not made public, did
not want to be interviewed by attorneys or news agencies. They left
the courthouse before the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he couldn't say why the jury wasn't persuaded. He
said jurors may have been unsettled by the Davidians' firepower,
which included automatic weapons, grenades, grenade launchers and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``for some people, it is difficult, if not
impossible, to believe that anyone with law enforcement would not
be completely truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also said that the judge's instructions to the jury
omitted key information, such as what responsibility the government
bore in foreseeing the tragedy and what duty it had to avert the
suicide of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would eat my shoe,'' Smith responded, if the instructions
didn't reflect the issues in the case.

JURY SAYS TOBACCO INDUSTRY MUST PAY $144.8 BILLION IN CLASS-ACTION
SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the largest damage award in U.S. history, a jury in
Miami-Dade County on Friday ordered the tobacco industry to pay
$144.8 billion in punitive damages to some 500,000 sick Florida
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some of the sick smokers and the widows and widowers
of others celebrated the verdict as a sweeping victory over the
industry, tobacco executives called the award ridiculous, and one
that would push the companies into bankruptcy, if it is ever paid
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The companies vowed to appeal, a process that could take years.
While those appeals are underway, their financial exposure could be
relatively minimal. Under a law passed last year with this case in
mind, cigarette makers could be required to post an initial bond of
no more than $100 million per company. A judge may decide as soon
as Monday whether that law applies in this case, since the suit was
filed before the law was passed. In addition, Florida law prohibits
a damage award that would force a company into bankruptcy. Experts
on both sides debated whether such a massive judgment would put the
companies out of business. ``There is no industry in America,
there's probably not a country in the world, that could withstand a
verdict of this size,'' said Dan Webb, a lawyer for Philip Morris,
the country's largest cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury, which has weighed the different phases of
this case for two years now, deliberated only five hours before
reaching its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of zeroes,'' said Judge Robert Kaye, as he read the
amount of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Saa, who has had his vocal cords and much of his
throat removed because of smoking-related cancer, became so
emotional after the verdict was read that he had difficulty
breathing, and had to leave the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how happy I am,'' said Saa, one of the
plaintiffs, speaking through an electronic voice box. ``My heart is
happy, because this is a lesson for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the massive verdict was an
appropriate punishment for an industry that makes a product that
kills 430,000 Americans every year and for misleading the public
about the dangers even after medical research showed that smoking
causes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye can reduce the amount, but lawyers for the industry are
likely to appeal any award approaching the billions the jury voted
for.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the five companies had said in closing arguments
that such a verdict would be a ``death warrant'' for the industry.
But after the jury's decision, the companies' lawyers said instead
that the judgment would have no immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased, because there is no practical impact on Philip
Morris,'' said Webb.
</P>
<P>
   He called the verdict ``an unfair procedure, unheard of in
American history,'' but one that would not stand up under an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a verdict in favor of no one,'' said Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris was ordered to pay $73.96 billion, R.J. Reynolds
$36.28 billion, Brown &AMP; Williamson $17.59 billion, Lorillard
Tobacco $16.25 billion, and Liggett Group Inc. $790 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire industry could not even pay that amount,'' said Dan
Donahue, senior vice president at R.J. Reynolds, of the judgment
against his company. ``It's a ridiculous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The punitive damages would come on top of the $246 billion the
industry agreed in 1998 to pay the states over 25 years in a
concession that ended its record of successful resistance to claims
of damages.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the $144.8 billion judgment was to be paid by
the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute, which
had provided false data that refuted medical research of the
dangers of smoking.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sick smokers, some of whom have followed the case every day from
the courtroom pews, were optimistic about the outcome. The same
jury had found in July 1999 that the tobacco industry manufactured
a deadly product, and that it had deceived the public for years. In
April, the panel ordered cigarette makers to pay $12.7 million in
compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the jury heard 157 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the punitive stage of the trial, sick smokers first asked for
$196 billion in damages. But the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs,
Stanley Rosenblatt, would eventually suggest an award of $154
billion to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day of reckoning,'' said Rosenblatt. ``This was never
about money. This was about showing these companies up for what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said the jury, which was made up of a postal worker,
a bank teller, a welder, a telephone technician, an assistant
principal and another school employee, ``did the right thing. They
said to those companies, `Cut it out. Tell us the truth.' They were
stoic, unemotional.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter in the case from now on, said Frank Amodeo, one of
three sick smokers who legally represents the 500,000 others in the
class-action lawsuit, the jury's verdict is the most significant
victory so far in a fight to make the companies acknowledge their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Amodeo contracted throat cancer about 10 years ago, cannot
swallow and must be fed through a tube. ``There is no amount of
money in the world that will change the way I eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was history making in other ways. Top executives for
the companies, who rarely testify under oath, took the stand to say
that their companies had changed, that they were spending millions
to discourage underage smoking and were repentant of the way
business was done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the companies had said the cigarette makers could
afford to pay between $150 million to $375 million, but would be
put out of business if the jury granted anything approaching the
requested award.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either destroy them or you don't,'' said Gordon Smith, a
lawyer for Brown &AMP; Williamson, in his closing argument. ``Your
verdict must reflect current ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of punitive judgment the industry said it could
afford to pay represents a fraction of its audited net worth, and
could be recouped in just a few days of wholesale cigarette sales,
said critics of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson, a unit of British American Tobacco, is
valued at $13.6 billion; Liggett, a unit of the Vector Group, is
valued at $317 million; Lorillard Tobacco, a unit of the Loews
Corp., $6.2 billion; Philip Morris, $56 billion, and R.J. Reynolds,
$2.7 billion.
 &UR;  &LR; ``We ask you to speak for all those silent, anonymous victims of
tobacco grieved by their loved ones but unknown to a callous and
deceitful industry,'' Rosenblatt said in his closing argument.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eclipsed the punitive damage award of $5 billion
against Exxon Mobil for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and a
$4.8 billion award against General Motors in a car fire in
California _ a judge later reduced that award to $1.09 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the largest award of any kind, much more than
the $22 billion awarded in Hawaii in 1996 to a treasure hunter who
sued former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines for an
alleged theft of gold bullion. That verdict was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, a former Wall Street executive who formed Smokefree
Educational Services, had testified for the plaintiffs on the
industry's ability to pay in the event of such a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Turner does not believe the plaintiffs will ever see any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, the guilty people don't always have to pay,''
he said. ``They were found guilty of lying, killing, causing
diseases. But the tobacco cartel has friends in high places. They
own Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The award, he said, ``will never amount to a hill of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the message, he said, will.
</P>
<P>
   ``These six ordinary people,'' he said, ``have decided this
industry is guilty of the biggest fraud, deceit, maiming, killing,
destroying and lying in the history of mankind. Nothing will ever
change that fact.''

RUSSIAN CREW MODULE CLIMBS TOWARD RENDEZVOUS WITH SPACE STATION
SEGMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recently launched Russian-built crew module for the
international space station began its climb Friday toward a linkup
with the other components of the orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Two successful maneuvers placed the 43-foot module, which is
designed to serve as the living quarters for the slowly developing
station's first resident astronauts, in an elliptical orbit with
high and low points of 224 miles and 167 miles, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The unpiloted crew module was launched from Central Asia by the
Russians late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous and dock with two
previously launched and joined segments of the U.S.-led station
late July 25. They are circling the Earth at an altitude of about
240 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Guidance and propulsion systems aboard the station's first
segments are designed to rendezvous automatically once the crew
module completes its climb through a gradual series of maneuvers.
The operation is being closely monitored by the Russian mission
control facility in suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   If the modules are successfully mated, the first resident crew
of cosmonauts and astronauts will be launched to the station for a
three-to four-month stay in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The crew module's many electronic and mechanical systems have
been undergoing a component-by-component check.
</P>
<P>
   The only component that has not passed muster so far is a backup
docking target, said Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman in Moscow. The
fixture may actually be correctly positioned, though a sensor is
indicating otherwise to ground control teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The target would be used only if the automated rendezvous is
unsuccessful. In that event, the Russians plan to launch a pair of
cosmonauts to the crew module in a Soyuz capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, the cosmonauts would attempt to bring the modules
together using a backup system that relies on television cameras
for guidance. The target is one of the guidance cues the cosmonauts
would use for the linkup.
</P>
<P>
   The crew module represents only the third large component of the
orbital outpost launched since assembly began in late 1998. Russian
financial difficulties delayed its lift off by 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are part of a 16-nation partnership
involved in the assembly of a new space station whose laboratories
will be used for a range of physics, biology and medical
experiments.

NASA SAYS HAZARD COULD CAUSE SPACESUITS TO CATCH FIRE 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bulky white garments that U.S. astronauts have worn for two
decades on spacewalks outside the shuttle have accumulated an oily
contaminant in their emergency oxygen supplies that could ignite,
NASA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The finding comes as the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is preparing for a steep increase in its number of
spacewalks, raising the concern. The space agency estimates that
its astronauts will conduct at least 165 of the six-hour excursions
over the next five years as it assembles the U.S.-led international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has ordered the dirty dispensing mechanisms in the garments
cleaned. New filters to prevent further contamination will be
installed in the ground oxygen supply systems for the suits' air
tanks before its astronauts walk in space again, said Greg
Harbaugh, who manages the agency's spacewalk planning office. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The concern, Harbaugh said, is that the oily droplets in the
regulators of the all-oxygen environment could ignite in the
high-pressure emergency system of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency apparatus is designed to force out a half-hour of
air for a spacewalking astronaut, even if the suit is punctured by
a small meteorite. The lower pressure primary system that normally
furnishes seven to eight hours of oxygen could be rapidly depleted
if the protective garment were breached. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; NASA's 84 previous spacewalks, including one during the most
recent shuttle flight in May, were conducted without the need for
an astronaut to turn to the backup air supply.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the space agency does not intend to press its luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is something that has the potential to create a fire if
the right conditions are present,'' Harbaugh said. ``It is my
judgment that it's an unacceptable risk to take.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA maintains 12 of the $10 million spacesuits, which were
developed before shuttle flights began in 1981. Though not every
mission includes plans for a spacewalk, at least two astronauts on
each trip aloft are trained and equipped to make an excursion to
deal with a range of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh said the spacesuit issue was brought to NASA's
attention in mid-June by the companies that developed the garments
and the vendor for the contaminated regulators, prompting a quick
response.
</P>
<P>
   Those activities were first disclosed by an Internet news
service on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A small quantity of an oily contaminant was found in the
regulators of the backup oxygen supply of all 12 suits. The
mechanisms had not been examined since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are still trying to track down the source, but the
leading suspect is the supply tank used by NASA's shuttle
contractors to prepare the spacesuits for flight. Shuttle engineers
believe the grime has been accumulating for years, Harbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason the contractors have been instructed by NASA to
install new low-temperature filters in their supply lines to trap
contaminants before they enter the suits, Harbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   The spacesuits are constructed of a puffy fabric suit pant, a
rigid structure that fits over the upper torso of the astronaut, a
helmet and a large backpack. The backpack contains the suit's life
support apparatus, including the primary and backup air supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also prompted an assessment of the primary oxygen
regulators in the suits, an analysis that will not be complete
before NASA's next scheduled shuttle flight in early September.
That mission includes a single spacewalk. Four excursions are
planned during another flight to the space station in October.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NASA has not found a contamination problem with the
primary air supplies of its spacesuits. Nonetheless, its engineers
have conducted a series of tests designed to reveal whether high
quantities of grime could ignite in a suit if it could not be
cleaned before a flight.
</P>
<P>
   The primary regulators were dirtied with twice the level of
contamination found on the emergency mechanisms for the trials.
Engineers were unable to detect signs of ignition in the primary
regulators, though they were cycled dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the findings, Harbaugh said he believes it will be
safe for NASA to continue with its shuttle missions as long as the
spacesuits they carry have only emergency air supply mechanisms
that have been thoroughly cleaned.

   A JURY IN FLORIDA AWARDS $144.8 BILLION TO SMOKERS
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Florida ordered the tobacco industry to pay $144.8
billion in punitive damages to 500,000 smokers in the largest
damage award in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some of the sick smokers and the widows and widowers

</P>
<P>
   SENATE REPEALS FEDERAL ESTATE TAX
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted to repeal the federal estate tax, brushing
aside a veto threat from President Clinton and giving Republicans a
symbolic victory on an issue at the top of their election-year
agenda. The vote was 59-39. Although Democrats have long said
repeal of the tax would be a hugely expensive giveaway to the rich,
nine of 45 Democrats voted for the legislation. Four Republicans
voted against.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ'S HIGHEST CLOSE IN THREE MONTHS
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market finished with its highest close in three
months as strong earnings and a tame inflation report bolstered
hopes that the Federal Reserve Board would not raise interest rates

   NEW PRESENCE IN THE BOSS'S OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   A federal agency's ruling this week that nonunion workers

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN MAID'S SUIT AGAINST DIPLOMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rare federal lawsuit in which a domestic worker accused her
employer, a diplomat from Bahrain, of keeping her in virtual
peonage has been settled out of court, the woman's lawyer said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the case, a prerequisite to any
criminal charges, the lawyer said. Until that investigation is
completed, she added, the maid, Shamela Begum, will remain in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in December in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, accused Mohammed Saleh, the second secretary at the
Bahraini Mission to the United Nations, and his wife, Khatun, of
flagrant labor law violations and indentured servitude, a violation
of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants had not addressed any of the suit's
allegations, but instead claimed diplomatic immunity. Under the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomatic envoys cannot
be prosecuted by a host country, although according to State
Department rules, they are to abide by local laws, including wage
and hour provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement prohibits the parties from discussing its terms
publicly. On Friday, Begum said only that she was glad to have
taken her case to court and was satisfied by its outcome. ``I
thought it was more or less fine,'' she said in a brief telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially strange twist, the Clinton administration,
which has been pushing for greater vigilance against what the
attorney general has called ``modern-day slavery,'' sided with the
defense, warning that a failure to honor the defendants' immunity
could lead to retaliation against American diplomats abroad. The
judge, Richard M. Berman, did not throw out the case, but urged the
parties to pursue out-of-court talks.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement agreement was reached last month, said Begum's
lawyer, Chaumtoli Huq of the Asian-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Begum, an illiterate mother of three from Bangladesh, has said
her ordeal began nearly two years ago, when an employment broker in
her hometown, Dhaka, arranged for her to work as a maid in Bahrain.
She was persuaded to be brought to work for the Salehs in December
1998 and was kept a virtual prisoner in the family's high-rise
apartment on Manhattan's East Side. They took away her passport the
day she arrived, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine months, she said, she was forced to work seven
days a week and was forbidden to leave the apartment alone. Her
wages _ $100 a month, she said _ were sent to her husband in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   Begum, who speaks only Bengali, escaped from the household last
summer with the help of a Bengali-speaking fruit vendor who worked
nearby and a South Asian workers' rights group called Andolan _
struggle, in Bengali. She has worked as a maid in other households
since then.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 800 migrant domestic workers with special visas
allowing them to work for U.N. officials in New York, State
Department officials said. In recent years, several of these
workers have sued for back wages and over other labor law
violations. A few cases have been settled out of court, like
Begum's. Others have been dismissed on the grounds of diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Huq said she hoped Begum's case would prompt other women to come
forward if they had been mistreated. Moreover, she said she hoped
the FBI would urge federal prosecutors to file criminal charges if
there was sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Margolin, an FBI spokesman, said he could not confirm his
agency's involvement in this or any other case.

CAMP DAVID TALKS IN LULL BEFORE EXPECTED WHIRL OF DECISION-MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whizzing around Camp David in golf carts and on
bicycles, as if they were resort guests and not confined like
prisoners of diplomacy in a pressure-cooker peace summit, Israeli
and Palestinian leaders spent their fourth day in secluded
negotiations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They divided into groups to tackle issues separately, and a
senior Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David said the
Americans had begun to offer proposals to bridge the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   With the information lid still tightly secured on the
presidential retreat in Maryland, it was unknown how far the
parties had progressed toward an actual agreement or whether, as
some American officials believe, they had not progressed much at
all.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have averted a crisis, a storm-out, a showy packing
of the bags or a deliberate leak to the news media. But Reuters
cited unnamed Palestinian officials as saying they had come close,
and claiming that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was ready
to storm out in anger after seeing the American bridging proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides expect that the serious decision-making
will begin only this weekend, despite a slowdown for the Jewish
Sabbath on Saturday, and will build toward some kind of peak early
next week before an unofficial deadline of Wednesday, when
President Clinton is scheduled to depart for a Group of 8 meeting
in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The informal atmosphere _ including one fender bender between
negotiators' golf carts _ belies the seriousness of the mood, said
Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman. ``These are intractable
issues,'' he said. ``These are issues that go to the vital
interests of both of the parties, so this is very serious. You
know, at times discussions are tense, but that should come as no
surprise to you.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official said that Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
spirits remained as high as they were on the plane ride to the
United States. At that time, the official said, Barak believed that
both sides were primed to compromise because they saw ahead only
negative alternatives _ renewed violence and unilateral steps that
would complicate each party's carefully nurtured international
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and American officials are stressing to the Palestinians
that Barak, whom the Palestinians had soured on long before the
summit talks, represented their best hope for a conciliatory peace
partner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the picture they are painting: Despite the fragility of
his new minority government, Barak, as a former general committed
to forging an agreement, has the authority to sell serious
concessions to an Israeli public hungry for an end to the conflict.
If no agreement is reached and the relationship disintegrates into
violence, Barak could end up forging a unity government with the
rightist Likud Party. Or he could go to new elections, in which
case either a rightist leader or a centrist with less clout as a
security expert than Barak would be elected.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, some Cabinet ministers have been priming Israelis for
possible concessions by publicly discussing some of the compromises
that may be on the table at Camp David. Some Israeli-Arab lawmakers
have been leaking ideas, too. None are new thoughts, but they are
being aired in what seems to be an effort to ease them into the
realm of the possible.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, whose draft
agreement in 1995 with Abu Mazen, the secretary-general of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, is providing a template, said on
Thursday that Israel would consider swapping land with the
Palestinians. That is, in order to retain some of the West Bank and
annex the Jewish settlement abutting Jerusalem, it might be willing
to turn over land adjacent to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   And Avraham Burg, the Parliament speaker, who has served as an
unofficial Israeli spokesman in Washington and New York this week,
hinted that land swaps might work in Jerusalem too. Jerusalem could
``expand and shrink,'' he suggested. That is, it could gain some
neighborhoods _ the Jewish ones outside its limits _ and lose
others, the Arab ones within. It is an idea that would provoke
volatile emotions in Israel but could help broker a solution to the
thorniest issue, Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an Israeli-Arab legislator, Ahmed Tibi, who used to
advise Arafat, said he had learned that both sides had agreed that
Israel would relinquish the few remaining settlements in the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The periphery of Camp David drew both Israeli and Palestinian
opposition leaders on Friday. Limor Livnat, a lawmaker from the
Likud party, showed up at the Thurmont Elementary School to give a
piece of her mind to the hundreds of reporters awaiting any
information. She opposes the peace summit. But she was ushered out
by American officials, into the parking lot, where a ragtag
collection of protesters gather every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Amr, a Palestinian Cabinet minister, was similarly exiled
earlier in the week. American officials are trying to keep the
parts of the Camp David area that they control a propaganda-free
zone in order, as one said, ``to give peace a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the outskirts of the summit zone, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright met with Palestinian opposition leaders who were
barred from entering Camp David to consult with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke with them in Emittsburg, Md., where side conferences
on issues like the environment and the regulation of the
electromagnetic space shared by the two sides are supposed to be
discussed. They are not being allowed to see Arafat inside the
retreat because it is restricted to official delegates, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the spirit of the ground rules we've put down, we
indicated that we would prefer that that meeting not happen up at
Camp David,'' Lockhart said.

HIGH-FLYING LAWYER AGAIN INFLICTS DAMAGES ON TOBACCO INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (With FLA-TOBACCO-SUIT, FLA-TOBACCO-ASSESS)  
 By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley M. Rosenblatt, the lawyer who won the biggest
class-action lawsuit award in history Friday, is part of a
husband-and-wife legal team that operates as lone eagles in the
tobacco wars. They are not among the big-name plaintiffs' lawyers
who sued the industry on behalf of the states and amassed hundreds
of millions of dollars and great political power.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the first time that Rosenblatt has scored big
against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be out of my mind if I was doing this for the money,''
Rosenblatt said in 1996, when his class-action lawsuits against
tobacco companies were just beginning to seem dangerous to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   That was before he was awarded $49 million in fees in the
tobacco industry's 1997 settlement with flight attendants, who
claimed they were damaged by secondhand smoke. And that also was
before Wednesday, when he won what one tobacco attorney called a
``death warrant'' for the industry: a $144.8 billion damage award
in a lawsuit brought by Florida smokers who blamed their illnesses
on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt's fee is yet to be determined by the court. He will
submit his expenses, and ask the judge for a percentage of the
award.
</P>
<P>
   The small _ some say aloof _ firm run by Rosenblatt and his
wife, Susan, an appellate lawyer, has made its reputation by
succeeding where polished celebrity lawyers have failed, and by
being paid handsomely for it.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco activists criticized his fee in the flight
attendant's lawsuit, particularly because the plaintiffs received
nothing. Four of the largest tobacco companies agreed to spend $300
million researching smoking-related illnesses. But the plaintiffs
retained the right to sue for individual damages.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal appeals panel dismissed what would have been the
largest class-action suit in history, brought against the tobacco
industry by a consortium of some 60 lawyers in 1996, attention
shifted to Rosenblatt's two suits, the flight attendant suit and
the suit representing some 500,000 Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's up to Ma and Pa Kettle,'' Rosenblatt said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   They have won several multimillion-dollar malpractice judgments
in Florida, including a $6 million verdict on behalf of a motel
guest who became a quadriplegic after diving off a pier and $3.8
million for the parents of a teen-ager who was killed when his
motorcycle was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt first encountered the effects of cigarettes in 1988,
when he successfully defended a St. Petersburg, Fla., doctor who
was accused of murder after he wrote about helping his wife die.
The doctor's wife had been suffering from lung cancer.

STARR SPOKESMAN DEPICTED AS EAGERLY LEAKING DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department closed its criminal contempt
of court case against Charles G. Bakaly III Friday by portraying
the former spokesman for the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, as
eagerly leaking confidential information to make the counsel's
office look important.
</P>
<P>
   Two FBI agents quoted Bakaly as telling them that he had seized
on an opportunity presented by questions from The New York Times
about the future of the office, but then felt the story had not
hidden his role as a source. ``I played a risky game, and I got
burned,'' an agent, Thomas F. Lewis, quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is charged with making false statements to government
officials when he denied providing sensitive information to The
Times for a Jan. 31, 1999, article that portrayed Starr as having
decided he could indict a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Bakaly told him that ``reporters need to be fed
information,'' and that the questions from The Times offered an
opportunity to tell the public that even if the Senate acquitted
President Clinton, ``the independent counsel's office was not going
to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another agent, Russell P. Robinson, said Bakaly told him the
message he wanted to send from the Office of the Independent
Counsel was ``in the event there was an acquittal in the Senate
case, the OIC could move forward with its indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Bakaly argued for a directed verdict of acquittal,
saying the prosecution had not even made a minimal case that he had
lied in denying discussing secret information. Bakaly's lawyers
have portrayed him throughout as earnestly seeking to deflect the
article away from the details of what was going on in the
prosecutor's office and toward a historical approach.
</P>
<P>
   Michele A. Roberts, a defense lawyer, said the government had a
``burden to prove to the court that these matters were nonpublic
matters'' and could have tried to do so by showing that none of the
information had been published before, or by getting Starr to
testify that the issues Bakaly discussed with The Times were
secrets. By doing neither, she said, the government forfeited its
case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court here said
she would rule on the motion on Monday. But she told the defense to
be ready to proceed with its case. She is hearing the case without
a jury, which is permissible under the law of criminal contempt
because the Justice Department had promised not to seek a prison
sentence of more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared in the midst of Clinton's Senate trial, and
it produced angry complaints from his lawyers and from Johnson.
Both charged that the story revealed secret information from the
grand jury. But last fall a federal court of appeals said
information about the prosecutor's strategy was not protected grand
jury material.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that by making false or misleading statements _
in particular the denial of discussing ``nonpublic matters'' _
Bakaly delayed the investigation of the leak and wasted the court's
time. Johnson ruled that such delays would constitute contempt; the
defense has said it will appeal the ruling if Bakaly is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Friday's argument dealt with how much of a secret it was
that Starr was considering four options _ to indict Clinton
quickly, to indict him but keep the indictment under seal until he
left office, to wait until he left office to indict, or not to
indict. Several government witnesses have conceded under
cross-examination that those choices are always available and did
not constitute any secret.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, 1999, all of the Starr office lawyers debated the
options in a lengthy meeting, and on Jan. 28, according to FBI
agent Michael Erbach, the Times reporter, Don Van Natta, brought
them up with Bakaly.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson testified that two independent counsel lawyers, whom he
did not name, sent a memo around the office the day after The Times
article ran, saying that from its detail, ``it appeared as though
Van Natta was at the all-attorney's meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis revealed another detail about that meeting. He said Bakaly
told them that Starr's deputy, Jackie Bennett, told him the lawyers
present had taken a straw vote on whether Clinton should be
indicted. But he did not give the result of the vote.

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry may be forever changed by a Florida jury's
stunning award of $145 billion in punitive damages in a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of injured smokers in
Florida. The process of appeals on every aspect of this case will
likely continue for years, making it hard to predict how much of
the award will ultimately stand. But there is no doubt that this
case poses a serious threat to the survival of the cigarette
business.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the award is an important symbol. The
industry, which for so long had been able to escape liability for
individual deaths and illnesses, is now facing a sea change in
public attitudes _ and the attitudes of future juries _ about its
responsibility for selling products that cause death and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, a punitive damages award cannot drive a
defendant into bankruptcy. The industry is challenging the
appropriateness of allowing a plaintiff class that could cover more
than 500,000 Florida residents. Other questions are also
unresolved. For example, the punitive damages are awarded to the
entire class, but it is unclear how such an award would be divided
among the unidentified class members, who would each still have to
show that his or her particular injuries came from cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the individual class members have yet to prove
their cases and many procedural issues will be reviewed by higher
courts, the six-member Florida jury has now found that the industry
committed fraud on the public, conspired to conceal the dangers of
smoking and placed on the market a product that was ``defective and
unreasonably dangerous.'' This spring, in the second phase of the
trial, the jury awarded nearly $13 million in compensatory damages
to three plaintiffs who had contracted lung or throat cancer as a
result of smoking. Now it has found that the industry must be
punished and deterred from further wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   For years, tobacco firms were able to beat such lawsuits by
blaming the smoker for not quitting. But that strategy did not work
with this jury when it was confronted with thousands of internal
industry documents showing that the companies had known for decades
that smoking causes disease and is addictive, and yet mounted
public campaigns to cast doubt on the scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco firms tried to argue that punitive damages were
unnecessary because the industry changed its conduct when it made a
$246 billion settlement with the states. The jury, reaching its
decision in only five hours, was not convinced. A California jury
also rejected that argument when it awarded a smoker with terminal
cancer $20 million in punitive damages in March. In the end, these
juries simply refused to let the industry get away with decades of
lying about a product that causes more than 400,000 deaths in
America a year.

leaders realized long ago the road to wealth lay in private
enterprise, not agriculture. So it decided to capitalize on a
traditional handicraft of its Muslim population -- sheepskin
processing. In 20 years, the village has grown these backyard
businesses into a multi-million dollar niche market. It now processes
5 million sheepskins a year. Sangpo proudly calls itself China's "Fur
City." Ding Yufeng, 23, left, and his father Ding Cunzheng, 50, stand
in their factory's warehouse surrounded by unprocessed sheepskins.

THINGS AGAIN LOOKING UP FOR ACUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - At first glance, there was nothing notable about
Amy Acuff's opening high jump of the 2000 Olympic Track and Field
Trials on Friday. The bar beckoned at 5-10. That was eight inches
lower than the former UCLA star's career-best mark, so the fact she
cleared it on her first try didn't send any pulses racing.
</P>
<P>
   Except hers.
</P>
<P>
   What looked for all the track world to be a humdrum jump was, in
fact, a huge step forward for Acuff, whose dreams of making a
second Olympic team came close to crashing on June 22 when her car
was rear-ended on her way to practice at UCLA's Drake Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff, 25, suffered whiplash in the accident and was
understandably worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt pretty bad,'' she said. ``The next morning I was
trying to put a spoon to my mouth and I was having shooting
pains.''
</P>
<P>
   Acuff missed four days of training. When she resumed jumping,
she was in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really bad because I couldn't hold my upper body up to
run,'' she said. ``It was a really retarded form of jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until this week that Acuff began to feel like the
jumper who set the collegiate outdoor record at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of impact, did Acuff see her Olympic dreams flash
before her eyes?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a second, I thought it's bad timing,'' Acuff said. ``But I
think everything happens for a reason. I just try to go with the
flow no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Acuff, one of track's pin-up girls, was deemed by a men's
magazine to be one of the country's most beautiful athletes. On the
track, however, she has suffered from a maddening lack of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just a big lack of meets'' for high jumpers, Acuff
said. ``I've been going to all-comers meets with 50-year-old men
competing against me, (in conditions) where I was going over the
river and through the dirt and jumping over curbs. It's really a
relief to get out and feel a little bit of pressure, just enough to
get the juices flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, she'll be one of 13 jumpers vying for three Olympic
berths in the high jump final. If she makes the team, it will be no
accident.

ANALYSIS: INDUSTRY CROSSES TROUBLING LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FLA-TOBACCO-SUIT, FLA-TOBACCO-LAWYER) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For tobacco companies, getting the $145 billion punitive damage
award handed down Friday by a Miami jury reduced, and even possibly
thrown out, may be the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting this one case may be the least of the industry's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago the idea that an individual smoker could
legally triumph against a tobacco producer was unthinkable. Now
even though the industry scores most wins, that has changed. And
the Miami panel's decision Friday in the first class-action case to
go to a jury has taken producers across an ever deeper and more
troubling legal Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, this is the realization of the industry's
50-year nightmare,'' said Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford
University. ``And that nightmare was that when the dam burst, it
would burst catastrophically.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing when cities and states started to line up to
sue the industry. It is another if the millions of Americans who
believe they became ill from smoking can start lining up to file
claims. And many experts believe that Friday's verdict is likely to
encourage more lawyers to bring similar claims in other states. And
the size of the verdict may also cause jurors in other smoking
cases to become more liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it will tend to ratchet juror verdicts
upward,'' said Peter Schuck, a Yale law professor who has served as
a legal consultant to a cigarette company.
</P>
<P>
   Both cigarette company executives and tobacco industry analysts
shrugged off the Florida verdict. Offering a first glimpse at what
is likely to be a protracted appeals process, they said the
two-year state trial had been riddled with procedural errors and
would be thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tobacco industry lawyers have long argued that a
class-action case involving all Florida smokers should never have
been allowed to go forward, because members of the group had all
decided to smoke for different reasons and at different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any financial ramifications to this
decision,'' said David J. Adelman, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``The scale of the verdict speaks to the absurdity of
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that tobacco producers saw Friday's
verdict coming. In May, as the Miami case progressed, a strange
consortium of industry lobbyists, Florida officials and plaintiffs'
lawyers involved in recent state tobacco lawsuits successfully
pushed a bill through the Florida Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   That bill limited to $100 million the amount that a defendant in
a Florida lawsuit had to post to appeal a verdict. Under the
previous rule, a defendant had to post the entire verdict to
appeal, an amount that, given the size of Friday's award, might
have driven producers into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Kaye of Miami-Dade Circuit Court, who is presiding
over the case, may decide as soon as Monday whether to enforce the
bond limit. And presuming that he does and that Stanley Rosenblatt,
the plaintiffs' lawyer in the Miami case, cannot get the new
Florida appeal measure declared unconstitutional, the tobacco
industry will have plenty of financial breathing room while its
appeals proceed.
</P>
<P>
   But how far they may want to pay the string out is another
issue. On Wall Street, the huge award will likely hang over the
value of the companies' stock. And while industry lawyers said they
were confident that a higher Florida court would dissolve the
class-action cases on procedural grounds, other experts are not
sure.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, the Stanford professor, said that while the Florida State
Supreme Court previously deferred ruling on the appropriateness of
a class action by smokers, their lack of action might not be
welcomed by producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have let the ball keep rolling so long and the case has
become so protracted that it seems unlikely they will turn around
now and say this case should not have happened in the first
instance,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. But now both producers and Rosenblatt, the
plaintiffs' lawyer, find themselves in a box with tremendous stakes
and with risks that could drive both closer to settlement talks,
something they have previously resisted, said Stephen Sugarman, a
law professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, despite his victories to date, could see them
quickly wiped out by an appeals court. For their part, tobacco
producers could roll their appeals' dice and lose. A settlement
could also wipe out much of Friday's award. But settling the case
might bring on more class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman said he had no idea how the Florida case would
eventually play out. But one lawyer who has worked with the tobacco
industry said that whatever happened in Miami case, its meaning was
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may get the Florida verdict reversed to zero,'' that
lawyer said. ``But this corroborates that the industry cannot win
the litigation battle.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HOMECOMING FOR A HERO? NOT REALLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  LONDON _ Pete Sampras and the Williams sisters have come to
Wimbledon and are now gone. Tiger Woods is not yet in St. Andrews
for the British Open. So Saturday night Britain presumably belongs
to the heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Or does it?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Business or pleasure?'' the man at Heathrow's passport counter
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business,'' the U.S. visitor replied. ``I'm here to cover the
fight Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What fight?'' the passport man asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lennox Lewis fight,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' the passport man said.
</P>
<P>
   In the taxi into Londontown, the driver had to be reminded that
Lewis was defending the WBC and the IBF titles against Frans Botha
of South Africa in the new London Arena next to the glassy office
buildings of the Docklands area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For another multimillion pounds,'' he snorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't Lewis a hero here?'' the American said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the boxing world he's known,'' the driver said, ``but it's
not like you have a pinup of him in your front room.''
</P>
<P>
   Or any other room.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight is billed as ``The Homecoming'' for Lewis, he
is not accepted here as a homeboy, even though he is the first
British-born heavyweight champion since Bob Fitzsimmons lost the
title to James J. Jeffries in 1899, and he parties here when he is
not in training. He also had most of his early pro fights in
England.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents are Jamaican and he grew up in Kitchener,
Ontario. He won the 1988 Olympic heavyweight gold medal for Canada
with a second-round knockout of Riddick Bowe at Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He seldom trains here anymore, but you would think that he would
have trained here this time, if only to help promote his first
fight in London since his second-round knockout by Oliver McCall at
Wembley in 1994 _ the only stain on his 36-1-1 record with 28
knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lewis trained, as he often has, at Caesars Brookdale
resort in Scotrun, Pa., in the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have mingled with the people, then the fight would
have been sold out the first night,'' Botha said, alluding to the
expected assembly of only 10,000 in the 12,000-seat arena. ``If I
was from London, I would have been training right here so I could
have all the fans around me. It was a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cable television era, boxers don't have to sell tickets
to the arena. Their money is usually guaranteed. Lewis will collect
an estimated $5.5 million and Botha $1.5 million for Saturday
night's delayed HBO telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The referee, incidentally, will be the respected Larry
O'Connell, the judge who judge scored Lewis' debatable draw with
Evander Holyfield at Madison Square Garden early last year as just
that: a 12-round draw.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is different here. Thursday's outdoor weigh-in at Covent
Garden should have been a promoter's dream. Attract the lunch-hour
crowd to the charming old market area that is now mostly cafes and
boutiques. See the boxers step on the scale in front of St. Paul's
Church, which opened in 1633 and was later a theater. Stir
interest. Sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But the London bobbies ordered the promoter Panos Eliades not to
publicize the site or the time of the weigh-in. The bobbies didn't
want the Covent Garden area more crowded than it usually is at
lunchtime. The bobbies got their wish. As Lewis weighed 250 pounds
and Botha 236, what turned out to be a nonevent was crowded but not
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fight itself, Lewis is a 14-to-1 favorite in the
legal betting shops over Botha, whose only losses in his 40-2-1
record were knockouts by Mike Tyson and Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put a lot of pressure on Botha,'' said Lewis'
trainer, Emanuel Steward. ``He'll be a real cutie-pie if you let
him. He'll turn, twist, grab you. If you give him room, it can be a
very awkward fight. You've got to stay busy. He's very durable,
too. Lennox can't sit around and wait. He can't fight a technical
fight. He's got to stay busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha's new trainer, Abel Sanchez, has the bulky South African
in better shape, with more strength and more stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that Frans punches harder than Oliver McCall did,''
Sanchez said. ``He could knock out Lewis in the first or the
12th.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody in London remembers how their homecoming hero was
knocked out by McCall six years ago. Or do they? &QL;

EU APPOINTS PANEL TO REVIEW AUSTRIA FOR POSSIBLE END OF SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Corrects spelling of Wolfgang in 20th graf.) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Five months after the European Union imposed sanctions
on Austria to protest the inclusion of members of a far-right party
in the Austrian government, machinery giving everyone a face-saving
way to end the diplomatic freeze is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts has been named to study Austria's human
rights record and the political nature of Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party. Once that is done, the sanctions are to be reviewed,
and _ if the panel finds Austria does not violate civil rights _
presumably lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Austria says it wants the sanctions off by October, when all 15
European Union leaders hold a summit meeting in France, although
France, the leader in imposing the diplomatic freeze on Austria,
still refuses to promise anything.
</P>
<P>
   But already there are signs of a thaw. At Bastille Day
celebrations Friday, Austria's ambassador was among the dignitaries
sharing the reviewing stand with President Jacques Chirac, a far
cry from the twists and turns that have gone on to keep Chirac out
of range of Austrian officials in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there are enormous pressures at work that are
likely to make the sanctions disappear fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, France has just taken over the rotating six-month
presidency of the European Union and both its prestige and perhaps
the timely expansion of the union are riding on its being able to
deliver on a difficult agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen countries on the runway to join the
union, the EU must overhaul its institutions or face paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for instance, most EU decisions require a unanimous
vote. That is hard enough with 15 members, but experts say it would
be virtually impossible to get anything done if there were more
members.
</P>
<P>
   With an issue like this to broker, many experts say, the tension
created by continued sanctions could be a disaster. Earlier this
month, Austrian officials threatened to use their veto to block any
sort of progress. This week, they seemed to back down, perhaps
judging how unpopular such a stand would make them. But analysts
say a failure to resolve the problem could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was French I would be worried,'' said Charles Grant, a
political analyst with the Center for European Reform in London.
``These issues are always brokered as a package. You don't want one
country that is not really trying to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the sanctions remain unanimously in force with
14 members refusing to meet Austrian officials at anything more
than a ``technical level,'' many European Union countries have
indicated that they would like to see the situation resolved.
Currently, France, Belgium and Holland are considered to be the
only hold outs calling for the sanctions to continue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some smaller ``euroskeptic'' countries, the freeze has been
seen as an example of big countries going after small ones for
their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the fact that Italy has had far-right
politicians in its government but no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   And many point out that Chirac's enthusiastic denunciations of
Austria's Freedom Party play well at home, where Chirac is already
trying to position himself for the 2002 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   That argument is having a particular impact in Denmark, which is
considering whether or not to adopt the euro as its currency. A
referendum on the issue is to be held this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boycott could cost the vote in Denmark,'' said Grant.
``The truth is that this freeze was entered into on the spur of the
moment, and nobody thought about the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   These ripple effects are also putting pressure on France to
stand down.
</P>
<P>
   This week certainly seemed to show a softening all around.
First, Chirac invited the Austrian ambassador to the Bastille Day
celebrations. Then, the Belgians announced that they, too, would
extend a similar courtesy and invite the Austrian ambassador to
their national day celebrations July 21.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria seemed to
be suddenly toning down his comments this week, and some analysts
suggested he already had the air of a man who had won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Brussels on Wednesday, he assured everyone that his
country would do nothing to sabotage the EU preparations for an
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words such as `threats,' `blackmail' and `veto' should be
deleted from the vocabulary,'' Schuessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel also embraced the choice of three ``wise men'' to
examine Austria's human rights record _ Martti Ahtisaari, the
former president of Finland; Jochen Frowein, director of the
Max-Plank Institute in Germany; and Marcelino Oreja, a former
Spanish minister and past member of the European Commission _ and
said they would have little problem reviewing Austrian ``commitment
to common European values.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts warned that Austria is not out of the
doghouse yet and could jeopardize the lifting of the sanctions if
it is not careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that everyone is getting ready for the
climbdown,'' said Peter Ludlow, the founding director of Center for
European Policy Studies in Brussels. ``But I'm still somewhat
skeptical of their ability to get there. ``The body language is
still not good. The Austrians better not crow too soon or too
loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his withdrawal of any threat to disrupt the coming
negotiations on expansion, Schuessel did not call off a referendum
on the EU sanctions that is planned for the fall if sanctions are
not lifted by then.
</P>
<P>
   Other EU countries have criticized the idea, fearing that the
Freedom Party will use the campaign to whip up anti-EU feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of the European Union's executive body,
Romano Prodi, who has been largely silent on the issue of the
sanctions, criticized them this week saying they should now be
ended ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said Prodi was willing to speak out now
because it was clear the sanctions had failed to achieve their
purpose and were fueling anti-EU sentiment in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in general terms that sanctions give better
results than those achieved in serious, vigorous, in-depth
dialogue.'' Prodi said.

HERGES MAKES BIG CONTRIBUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If someone asked you to name the most valuable
Dodger of 2000, whom would you choose?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield? Eric Karros? Kevin Brown?
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, Mike Piazza? Pedro Martinez? Eric Young?
</P>
<P>
   Let's throw another name in for consideration, without sarcasm.
Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that is proving to be just minutely better than the
last, Gary Sheffield is having a fabulous year at the plate and
Kevin Brown has been stingy as usual on the mound. But they were
expected to have good years. They're trusted, well-paid veterans
who are among the best at their craft.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges, on the other hand, is a 30-year-old rookie with a
modest resume who pitched his way onto the roster in the spring and
has been the most dependable arm in an otherwise undependable
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Herges has won six games without a loss while serving in that
bastard of baseball roles, middle relief. His six straight wins are
the most by any rookie pitcher in the majors this season, and he's
thrown 52 1/3 innings in 35 appearances while averaging almost a
strikeout per inning.
</P>
<P>
   He began the season by not allowing an earned run (and just one
unearned run) in his first 12 appearances over 19 1/3 innings. His
ERA is 3.37 -- 2.13 if you throw out his one bad performance, a
seven-run outing against Arizona in May -- and opponents are
hitting just .233 against him.
</P>
<P>
   During the All-Star break, several baseball publications checked
in with midseason nominations for awards, and Herges' name came up
in the rookie of the year category.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reach to think a middle reliever would get votes ahead of
an everyday player or starter. But the fact others have noticed his
work is more than enough flattery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored to death to just be mentioned,'' said Herges.
``I'm just hoping to duplicate or improve on what I've done so far
in the second half of the season. I don't think it's right for me
to talk about personal goals. I just want to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges may have been the longest shot of anyone to make a major
league roster in 2000. He made his major league debut last year
after seven years in the minors, and franchises don't provide many
opportunities for rookies over 30.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive, he stuck around and fought his way to the
majors after suffering a nightmarish 1997 season that would have
broken the spirit of most ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   After making 40 appearances in AA and AAA in 1996 and compiling
an earned run average under 3.00, in 1997 he blew up like Mt. St.
Helen's. He was 0-9 with an ERA over 8.00 in 100 innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a quality year in 1996, spent a month in AAA, and then
pitched well during winter ball in Venezuela,'' Herges said. ``I
felt I had a future. But everything went bad in 1997. I can truly
say I didn't have one good outing all year. Not one. It was tough
getting up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I analyzed everything to the point where it was blinding. Once
your confidence gets torn up, it's hard to get it back, especially
in (hitter friendly) Albuquerque. It got to the point where every
time I stepped on the mound I thought something bad was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 27 and having been removed from the Dodgers'
40-man roster, Herges was staring at a well-known intersection.
More than a few friends and family members suggested it might be
time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends from high school and college would say hey, when will
you give it up?' When is enough enough?' Even one of my brothers
who played college basketball asked how long I was going to stick
it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the same thing to everyone: They'll have to rip the
jersey off me, and there's 29 other teams out there. I'll quit when
every door is shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people who kept the door open for Herges were Claude Osteen
and Goose Gregson. Osteen, the current Dodger pitching coach, was
Herges' pitching coach at Albuquerque in '97 and got him a ticket
to winter ball in the Dominican after that awful season. ``I'll be
honest, I don't know what (the Dodgers) were thinking when they
said OK, all I know is I was grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregson, the Dodger pitching coach for parts of 1998 and 1999,
was Herges' pitching coach in the Dominican and worked with him
daily, teaching him a changeup and improving his mental approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can ever give up on anybody who has as good
an arm as Matt,'' Osteen said earlier this season. ``Even during
that season (1997), he had the ability to take the ball everyday
and pitch. He could throw back-to-back days and had good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think playing winter ball did wonders for him because he got
the chance to get his innings in. If a guy has the right makeup and
is willing to stick it out, there's a chance he'll find it if he
pitches enough. What he has going for him now is what he learned
from that adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times that season when Claude told me he had
restless nights after I pitched,'' Herges said. ``But he believed
in me and helped me get through it. No one ever said I didn't have
the stuff. If one had, I might have decided to quit. But they were
always encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges, who didn't start playing competitive baseball until he
was 15, rebounded well enough in the minors in 1998, then took out
a personal loan to go play winter ball in Australia. He got steady
work, picked up a slider, and then blossomed as a starter in
Albuquerque in 1999 before a mid-season callup.
</P>
<P>
   He made the Dodger roster in 2000 in part because of the team's
unsettled pitching, which included two relievers returning from
injury (Gregg Olson, Antonio Osuna), two starters with baggage
(Carlos Perez, 41-year-old Orel Hershiser) and one non-roster
player, Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his run-less April, he remained on the bubble. But
he's secured a spot with continued success. He's had 11 scoreless
appearances in 13 outings of two innings or more. His 6-0 record
could be even better if the offense had been as efficient. He
didn't allow a run in six one-run losses this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown us things this year we didn't see last year,'' said
Osteen. ``He's learned more about pitching and has more movement on
his fastball, and he has a great attitude towards everything,
because he's not taking anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, I dreamed of having a major league career,''
Herges says. ``I wish I could have figured out a way to get here
sooner, but it's just great to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   HERGES STATS:
</P>
<P>
   G / IP / H / ER / BB / K / ERA
</P>
<P>
   35 / 52.1 / 45 / 23 / 51 / 3.27
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: Didn't allow a run in April, 15 innings over 10
appearances ... Extended streak of innings without an earned run to
19 1/3 ... Has most consecutive wins of any rookie pitcher in 2000,
and fourth-longest streak of any pitcher in the National League ...
Hasn't allowed a run in 25 of 35 appearances on the season, and
allowed one run in 11 of 13 appearances lasting two innings or more
... Native of Champaign, Illinois. Attended Illinois State ...
Parents drove from Illinois to L.A. to see his first major league
game in 1999 ...

RUSSIAN PUZZLE: WHAT DOES THE WAR ON TYCOONS MEAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ No one outside the Kremlin is quite sure why, or what
it portends, or even whether it will last very long. But after nine
long years of fabulous high living and seeming immunity from the
rules that govern mere mortals, Russia's infamous tycoons have
suddenly found themselves marked men.
</P>
<P>
   At least, some have. Whether they continue to be targets will
say much about whether President Vladimir Putin's much-vaunted
``dictatorship of the law'' is in fact that or is more in the mold
of the last Kremlin, where the rich played by their own laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Russia's government has launched public
campaigns of legal and political pressure against the titans who
run five of the nation's most powerful business combines, including
the largest oil company, automaker, metals processor and power
utility.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, government agencies have lodged tax-evasion
charges against the No. 1 petroleum company, Lukoil, and the
automaker AvtoVAZ.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded in a letter that the tycoon who owns 38 percent of
Norilsk Nickel, a vast Siberian mining company, repay $140 million
supposedly shorted the government when the company was privatized
in the early 1990s. A similar complaint was filed against Tyumen
Oil, another big petroleum company, in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, the Russian parliament's Audit Chamber took aim at
the electricity monopoly RAO-UES, accusing it of illegally selling
a stake to foreigners when part of the state-owned company was
auctioned to the public in 1992. The chairman of RAO-UES is Anatoly
B. Chubais, who was former prime minister under President Boris
Yeltsin and who oversaw the early privatization of Russian
industry, including UES.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais is reviled by many average Russians as the symbol of
Russia's economic collapse. But he remains the godfather of
right-wing politics here and an icon of the very free-market
policies Putin has demanded that parliament enact this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Chubais called the accusations against RAO-UES unfounded
_ a ``red revanche'' led by parliament's communists, he said _ but
added that he was worried by their political implications.
</P>
<P>
   Whether founded or not, it would be hard to find in the gold
rush that was Russia's early transition to capitalism anyone who
did not play fast and loose with the few rules of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the political implications of this new campaign have left
almost all scratching their heads. For it is hard to tell, yet,
whether the rash of attacks on the so-called oligarchs is the
payoff on Putin's longstanding pledge to apply the same laws to
both the tycoon and the kiosk operator, or the beginning of some
darker and more subtle bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for clarity on this,'' said Thomas Graham,
a former U.S. diplomat who is now a Russia scholar with the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, everybody wants to see the thievery stopped,'' he
said Friday, ``and I think most people realize these oligarchs'
empires were built in an illicit fashion. But if it looks like this
is being politicized, it creates problems for investors in Russia
and for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics has been high on most observers' minds since May, when
the first major attack was sprung against Boris Gusinsky and his
Media-Most empire, a collection of print and broadcast outlets that
are among the Kremlin's most influential critics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, various government offices have staged
armed raids on Gusinsky's offices, seized a gun once awarded him by
Yeltsin, accused him of swindling the government in the sale of a
television station, and briefly jailed him in one of Moscow's most
notorious prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has chided his government for being overly enthusiastic in
its pursuit of Gusinsky, but he has otherwise been silent, leaving
the question of whether he has approved such assaults or is simply
tolerating them because he lacks the political power to call them
off.
</P>
<P>
   To some experts, the challenges are distinguished by two traits:
Many involve owners of powerful media companies, and none touch
those tycoons who are said to be closest to the Kremlin and the
people who made Putin president, the friends and relatives of
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Lukoil has extensive interests in newspapers and local
television. The power behind Norilsk Nickel, Vladimir Potanin, is
an investor in the national daily Izvestia. The man behind AvtoVAZ,
the much-maligned tycoon Boris Berezovsky, took control last year
of Russia most respected and powerful business newspaper,
Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to feel the government's sting is Roman Abramovich, a
Yeltsin-family intimate whose Sibneft oil empire was formed from
one of the most notorious privatization schemes in the mid-1990s.
Nor has Putin's government been especially cooperative in
Switzerland's investigation of another Yeltsin family friend, Pavel
Borodin, who oversaw a Kremlin restoration project that has become
the object of a sprawling bribery and money-laundering
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin resigned, Putin moved Borodin out of the Kremlin
to an honorific job as head of a body overseeing a slow-moving
economic union of Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other theories as to why the tycoons are suddenly
under assault. One is that the tycoons themselves are jockeying for
advantage in the new Putin government, using their remaining power
to muscle various state agencies into persecuting their rivals. By
that explanation, Putin is at least in part a bystander in a fight
that is not entirely under his control.
</P>
<P>
   Putin himself seems of two minds. In an interview Friday in
Izvestia, he said ``tax evasion and other abuses acquired a mass
scale and became routine'' in Russia's early years, and so it was
natural for those who benefited from the loose rules of the time to
oppose a crackdown now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many businessmen today have found themselves in the `zone of
risk,' in potentially difficult relations with the law,'' Putin
said. ``So, how can't they be but nervous?''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said, ``businessmen are now trying to
settle scores with one another by using state structures and law
enforcement bodies.'' He added: ``An end should be put to this.
Otherwise, further damage will be inflicted by such actions.''
</P>
<P>
   One longtime political expert, Vyachaslav Nikonov, a former
member of parliament, said in an interview Friday that an internal
battle among the tycoons was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally likely, he suggested, that Putin has simply
given his government free rein to go after the tycoons, both for
political gain and for the immense riches that the tycoons control,
which the government would like to tap.
</P>
<P>
   And if that is not enough, he said, the Kremlin has an obvious
reason to soak the very richest Russians: The very poorest ones,
who vastly outnumber them at the polls, have been salivating at the
prospect for close to a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just popular,'' Nikonov said. ``It's absolutely perfect
politics. People in the streets are absolutely delighted with
this.''

GENERAL MILLS SAID TO BE READY TO VOTE ON PILLSBURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This article now replaces ECON-REPORT on the first business
page of The New York Times.) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of General Mills is meeting Sunday to consider the
company's proposed acquisition of Pillsbury from Diageo PLC for
$10.5 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the board, the companies could announce the deal
on Monday, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would follow a rash of consolidations in the consumer
food industry as food makers battle with grocery retailers for more
leverage in pricing products.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would also immediately make General Mills an attractive
takeover target because it would diversify its product line, which
now includes cereal brands like Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs, to
include Pillsbury's stable of brands like Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
Green Giant frozen food and would give it annual sales of nearly
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, General Mills has offered to pay
Diageo about $4.5 billion in cash and about $6 billion in stock for
Pillsbury, giving Diageo a stake in the combined concern of about
33 percent. As part of the agreement, Diageo, which is based in
Britain, would also get two seats on the board of General Mills.
Both General Mills and Pillsbury are based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, which has historically acted like a holding company of
sorts for a variety of food and spirits companies, is quickly
abandoning the food business to focus on its much more profitable
spirits business, which includes Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker
whiskey and Guinness stout.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo recently announced that it planned to spin off 20 percent
of Burger King, signaling its intention to eventually sell the
entire fast-food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that with the proceeds from the sale of Pillsbury,
Diageo might go on its own acquisition binge, buying rival spirits
makers like Seagram's liquor business, which is being put up for
sale as part of Vivendi's recent plan to acquire that company.
</P>
<P>
   Though General Mills is expected to acquire Pillsbury's entire
stable of businesses, executives close to the company have
indicated that it may seek to sell brands like Green Giant and
possibly several others that do not strategically fit the company's
brand portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills products include the Betty Crocker line of cake
mixes, Hamburger Helper, Pop Secret microwave popcorn, Gold Medal
flour, and Yoplait and Colombo yogurt. It recently scored a major
hit with Go-Gurt, a yogurt aimed at children that is packaged in a
slender portable tube requiring no spoon. So successful is Go-Gurt,
in fact, that an adult version is being planned.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury's product lineup also includes the Old El Paso line of
Mexican food and Progresso soups.
</P>
<P>
   There are overlaps in several areas, particularly flour and cake
mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Jaine Mehring, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, recently
wrote in a report to investors, ``We believe General Mills would be
most interested in the Pillsbury Doughboy businesses and the
refrigerated-foods technology.'' She added, ``However, it's hard to
imagine Mills taking on Green Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Diageo dropped 2 pence each, to 597 pence, or $8.95,
in London on Friday. Shares of General Mills slumped 68.75 cents
each, to $36.3125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sale of Pillsbury follows Unilever's proposed $20.3 billion
acquisition of Bestfoods and Philip Morris' planned $14.9 billion
buyout of Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a General Mills-Pillsbury combination would put
even more pressure on companies like Campbell Soup, H.J. Heinz and
Kellogg to consider their own own acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would probably mean job cuts in Minneapolis. ``As with
any merger there will be some consolidation of jobs and things like
that, and I assume some executive-level jobs will be lost,'' said
Thomas Stinson, the Minnesota state economist.

JURY FINDS U.S. OFFICIALS NOT LIABLE IN DEATHS OF BRANCH
DAVIDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert sentence in 7th graf noting infrequency with which
such findings are overruled by the judges; in 9th graf, inserts
`charges.')  
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In a striking victory for the government, an
advisory panel of five jurors took just over an hour Friday to find
that federal officials were not liable in the deaths of nearly 80
Branch Davidians who were killed with four government agents in the
1993 raid and standoff at the sect's compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials portrayed the jury's finding as a vindication
for them in an episode that provided one of the darkest chapters in
the history of federal law enforcement, threatened the career of
Attorney General Janet Reno and continues to generate criticism.
The lawsuit itself represents a six-year legal struggle that
ultimately became a highly publicized test of the government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This terrible tragedy was the responsibility of David Koresh
and the Branch Davidians, not the federal government,'' the Justice
Department said in a terse statement. ``We are pleased the jury
affirmed that view.''
</P>
<P>
   The swift verdict, which came after a month of testimony, may
not be the final word on the case, however.
</P>
<P>
   Walter S. Smith, the federal judge presiding, will ultimately
decide the outcome of the wrongful-death suit. Earlier Friday,
before the jury was seated, Smith reminded lawyers involved that
``It's important for everyone to understand that their decision is
in no way binding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to consider the advice of the jury, but by law I
cannot be bound by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows for advisory panels in cases in which the
government is being sued, said Smith, who limited the jury's role
in the suit to this advisory capacity. Lawyers involved in the case
said Friday that they could not recall an instance in which a judge
overruled a jury's advisory finding.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will not make his ruling until at least August, after he
has heard another part of the case dealing with whether federal
agents fired into the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel compound as it
was consumed by flames on April 19, 1993. That issue will be
decided by him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and relatives of Branch Davidians killed during the
siege had sought $675 million, accusing the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms of using excessive force and firing
indiscriminately during the initial Feb. 28, 1993, raid to arrest
Koresh, the sect leader, on weapons violations charges. Six Branch
Davidians, as well as the four agents of the bureau, were killed
that day in the beginning of a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   They also claimed that commanders on the scene for the FBI at
the April 19 fire had exceeded their authority while implementing a
Washington-approved plan to use tanks to inject tear gas into the
compound, ultimately causing the fire in which about 75 people,
including 20 children, died. The government was also negligent,
they had claimed, for not having adequate equipment on hand to
fight that fire.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers had argued that the Branch Davidians ambushed
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents involved in the initial raid
and set the final, devastating fire themselves as part of a suicide
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments from both sides in the case, delivered earlier
Friday, were steeped in emotional outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing about this trial is that there will be
another David Koresh. This case is about the children. It's too
late to save the children of Mount Carmel. What you do here will
determine what happens to those next children,'' the plaintiffs'
lead lawyer, Michael Caddell, told jurors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had attempted to fix blame for the raid, standoff and
fire squarely on the shoulders of those who planned the operations,
but spoke glowingly to the jury of the ``brave men'' of the
government who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men under that kind of pressure make mistakes,'' he said.
``It's not their fault. They were placed in an impossible position.
They didn't give the orders. They didn't make the plans.''
</P>
<P>
   During his final argument to the jury, J. Michael Bradford, the
U.S. attorney representing the government, called the events at
Mount Carmel ``a terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of those children it makes me mad and angry.
Those children should be alive today, would be alive, but for the
actions of a man who thought he was Jesus Christ,'' he said,
referring to Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be shocked and outraged by the conduct of David
Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Instead, we have this lawsuit that
seeks to validate their actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his charge to the jury, Smith had listed four questions that
jurors should answer in assigning blame:
</P>
<P>
   Did the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms use excessive
force and fire indiscriminately during the initial raid? Did FBI
agents act negligently, going beyond their orders, in their use of
tanks during the final assault on the compound? Did those tanks
cause the April 19 fire, and were FBI commanders negligent in their
decision not to have firefighting equipment available on the scene
that day?
</P>
<P>
   As federal protections grant wide latitude for agents pursuing
official duties, Smith said, if jurors answered no to the first two
questions, there was no reason to answer the last two.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, jurors got no further than the first two questions,
the judge said. The decision of the panel was unanimous, and the
jurors did not want to speak to reporters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he thought the jury was likely swayed by ``all the
guns'' the sect kept at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that quantity of weaponry this close to Waco was too
much for them,'' he said of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would appeal the verdict, Caddell hesitated and
said, ``As a a practical matter, when you get a verdict, it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's lawyer, Bradford, said he believed the verdict
vindicated the actions of the government agents who, he said,
``faced a very dangerous group of people in a very difficult
circumstance in 1993 in trying to carry out their job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This verdict shows the responsibility for this tragedy is with
David Koresh and the Branch Davidians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said, ``The significance of the jury's
findings to the courageous federal law enforcement officers who
have had to absorb unproven allegations and public criticisms for
all those years cannot be overstated. An enormous burden has been
lifted from them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguments in the case were delayed Friday morning while Smith
responded to accusations made Thursday by Caddell that the judge
was trying to ``engineer a verdict'' through the four-part
questionnaires he had prepared for the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to set the record straight. I have not in any way tried
to engineer a jury charge. I have tried to simplify the issues for
this jury,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those involved in the case said Smith's narrow jury
charge, and limitations he placed on evidence admissible during the
trial, may have kept jurors and the public from getting all of the
relevant facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly, terribly frustrated by the way this case has
gone,'' said former attorney general Ramsey Clark, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, before the jury reached its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a negligence case, it's a constitutional case. How
do you drive a tank into a church dozens of times and then call it
negligence? The government has made the victims into the
violators,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And David Thibodeau, a Branch Davidian who survived the fire,
also expressed frustration at the narrow focus of the evidence
presented during the trial. ``It's outrageous that after two
congressional hearings and the criminal trial they are still
limiting what the public knows about this case. It'll be another 20
years before we find out what really happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still an ongoing investigation of the Waco events being
conducted by a special counsel, former Sen. John Danforth,
appointed by Reno last September. It is not known when he will make
his final report.
</P>
<P>
   But Caddell said that for many people, Friday's verdict may be
the end of lingering public questions about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vast majority of the American people will take
this as the last word. What they will take away is that five people
sat on a jury and decided that the government was not negligent,
and that will be the end of it,'' Caddell said.

CBS RECHECKING BACKGROUND OF `BIG BROTHER' PARTICIPANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reacting to the news that a participant in its new reality
series ``Big Brother'' is a follower of the former Nation of Islam
official Khalid Abdul Muhammad, CBS said Friday that it was
``looking into'' the report but at the moment saw no reason to
remove the man from the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, CBS said that ``we and the producers of `Big
Brother' will not tolerate nor permit any hate speech on the
program.'' But the statement emphasized that ``there has been no
hate speech on Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after The New York Daily News reported Friday
that William Collins, one of 10 participants in ``Big Brother,'' is
a follower of Muhammad, who now leads a group called the New Black
Panther Party. Muhammad was ousted from the Nation of Islam for his
denigration of Jews, whom he once called ``bloodsuckers.'' He has
also denounced whites and has called Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a
devil.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad organized the Million Youth March in 1998 in Harlem,
which ended in a violent confrontation with the police. Collins,
who also uses the name Hiram Ashantee, attended that rally. The
News reported that he was at Muhammad's side at a news conference
during the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, under the name Ashantee, was quoted in The Philadelphia
Inquirer after the march, criticizing the police; he made no
anti-Semitic statements. As Hiram Ashantee he is well known in
Philadelphia as an organizer for Khalid and an activist with black
youth groups. In a biography included in CBS promotional material,
Collins is called a ``youth group leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' show puts 10 strangers in a specially
constructed house for three months where their every movement is on
camera. Every other week one house member is voted out by viewers
after being nominated for banishment by the other housemates.
Collins was one of two house members nominated for ouster on
Thursday. The members who chose him cited the tension and
dissension he was causing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two weeks of shows, Collins has been outspoken
about his racial views, but he has not engaged in anything that
would have been described as hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some executives involved in the production of ``Big
Brother'' expressed concern that Collins had not been entirely
forthcoming about his background. For example, when asked if he
ever went by any other names he reportedly said only that he
sometimes used the nickname ``Hiram.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the show said that the production
company, Endemol, a Dutch television company, and CBS, which is
part of Viacom Inc., had conducted a background search on William
Collins, not Hiram Ashantee. The search included credit reports,
and a full legal report. Nothing was found to exclude Collins.
</P>
<P>
   CBS began another search Friday and said it still found nothing
that would warrant excluding Collins from the show.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS spokesman said that as of Friday evening the network had
received no calls of protest about Collins from any Jewish
organizations.

AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY LAST OF BODIES FOUND IN BARRELS  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY DIANE CARROLL and TANYANIKA SAMUELS, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As the last of the bodies found in barrels
was identified Friday as that of teen-ager Deborah Lynn Faith, a
family member said relatives had received suspicious-looking
letters about the time Deborah and her mother, Sheila Dale Faith,
disappeared six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, supposedly from Sheila Faith, said she had met a
wonderful man who was taking her and Debbie to Australia, said
Sheila Faith's brother, William Howell of Chandler, Texas. The
letters were sent to his two sisters in the summer of 1994, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The typewritten letters were ``in the form of what a
professional individual would write,'' Howell said. ``It wasn't
just common, everyday language Sheila would use.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, his sisters do not think that the signature at
the bottom was Sheila Faith's handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have charged John E. Robinson Sr., 56, of Olathe,
Kan., with capital murder in the deaths of the Faiths and three
other women whose bodies were found in barrels on both sides of the
state line.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also has been linked to three women and a baby who
disappeared in the 1980s. The families of two of those women have
reported receiving similar letters from their loved ones about the
time they dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the letters implied that the women were doing well
and would not be around for a while. One was received by the family
of Paula Godfrey, who disappeared in 1984, and another by the
family of Lisa Stasi, who disappeared in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Raymore Police Chief Kris Turnbow confirmed Friday that the task
force investigating Robinson had received the letters from the
Howell family.
</P>
<P>
   Howell said detectives told him that the letters could be
important evidence in linking the Faiths to Robinson. Howell's
sisters declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbow also said investigators have determined that a van owned
by the Faiths in 1994 turned up in Kansas City sometime in the
mid-1990s. The van was towed by Kansas City police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have asked the Police Department for a copy of the
tow report, Turnbow said. That report should say where the van had
been towed from and perhaps what kind of shape it was in.
</P>
<P>
   The van has since gone through several owners, Turnbow said, and
been sold for salvage.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, questions about bistate jurisdiction
appeared to be resolved on Friday. Robinson is charged in three
deaths in Missouri and two in Kansas. He is being held in the
Johnson County, Kan., Jail on $5 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster requested
temporary extradition of Robinson from Kansas to begin Missouri's
case against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson County Prosecutor Paul Morrison said that plan could
jeopardize the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Koster said Missouri's case would have to wait until
prosecutors in Kansas have tried their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri is ready to go,'' he said. ``So when John Robinson
comes for arraignment, we'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are continuing to pursue aspects of the case
including Robinson's source of income, his financial holdings and
the way he went about making contact with the victims. X-rays
crucial
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had to wait for X-ray records from California to
identify Debbie Faith, who was 16 when she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Young of the Jackson County medical examiner's office
used X-rays taken within one year of her disappearance to make the
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Faith had several ailments and used a wheelchair. She had
undergone surgery that required insertion of staples in her abdomen
area, and she also had a hip deformity, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbow said investigators had been confident all along that the
body was that of the missing teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators made certain assumptions earlier on, and so
detectives proceeded with investigation as if they knew the
identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities initially suspected that two of the bodies in
Raymore were those of the Faiths, but early tests indicated
otherwise. Those tests included comparing old dental records and
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   But lingering doubts by members of the task force investigating
the case prompted Jackson County medical examiners to take another
look.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Faiths said Friday that they still had held some
hope that the last body would not be Debbie Faith's.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Lawrence of Fullerton, Calif., whose daughter had been
best friends with Debbie Faith, said she and her daughter wondered
for weeks what the outcome would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad it has come to such a dreadful conclusion,''
Debbie Lawrence said. ``At least now we know'' what happened to
her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said the Faiths' relatives likely would be able to claim
the bodies by month's end.
</P>
<P>
   They were the last of the five victims to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Faith's body was identified three weeks ago. The remains
of the mother and daughter were found in a Raymore storage locker
along with those of Beverly J. Bonner, formerly of Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Two bodies found on property Robinson owns in Linn County, Kan.,
were those of Izabela Lewicka, a former Purdue University student,
and Suzette Trouten of Monroe County, Mich.

BRAZIL SCANDAL REACHES TOP RANKS OF GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A long-simmering political corruption
scandal has now penetrated the upper echelons of the Brazilian
government and prompted a sudden stock-market downturn, thanks to
the publication on Thursday night of what a Brazilian news magazine
describes as transcripts from 400 hours of wiretapped telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcripts, a fugitive judge who has been accused of
overseeing a fraud and embezzlement scheme, implicates a powerful
former presidential aide, a member of the economic Cabinet, a
senator and several congressional deputies in an illegal patronage
and influence-trafficking network. The magazine, Isto E, did not
disclose how it had obtained tapes of the wiretaps, but government
officials have not challenged their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal comes at a delicate moment for President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso. With municipal elections set for October, his own
popularity near a record low and opposition parties eager to
exploit the scandal, business interests have expressed concern that
the affair could dampen confidence in Latin America's largest
economy, which has come roaring back from last year's crippling
currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of the crisis, which the daily Jornal do Brasil
on Friday called the worst in the six years of Cardoso's
presidency, is a courthouse in Sao Paulo that remains unfinished
nearly a decade after the start of construction.
</P>
<P>
   Recent investigations have determined that normal bidding
procedures were bypassed in awarding contracts to
politically-connected developers and that nearly $150 million in
government funds for the project has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has already led the Brazilian Senate to expel one of
its members for the first time in its 170-year history. Senator
Luiz Estevao of Sao Paulo, a member of the government coalition,
was impeached on June 20, found guilty of violating parliamentary
decorum, and, once stripped of his parliamentary immunity, arrested
on charges that a construction company he owns pocketed the bulk of
the missing money.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, attention has shifted to Cardoso's former chief of
staff and coordinator of his 1998 re-election campaign, Eduardo
Jorge Caldas Pereira, now a prosperous business consultant in
Brasilia who has been pressed to explain the content of 117 phone
calls he received from the fugitive judge, Nicolau dos Santos Neto,
while the courthouse was being built.
</P>
<P>
   Also under fire is the minister of planning and budget, Martus
Tavares, who authorized additional spending on the project even
after it was being criticized for cost overruns. In the published
transcript of the tapes, dos Santos Neto, the fugitive judge,
boasts of using ``my connection'' to convince the planning minister
to authorize the outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions that Tavares would be fired during an emergency
cabinet meeting on Thursday night proved off base, and he has
denounced the press for what he calls a campaign of sensationalism
and a lack of understanding of the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the Senate's most influential members said that
``Tavares should leave Cardoso's government as soon as possible,''
and a group of deputies are circulating a petition that would call
Congress back from its winter recess for a special session to
investigate the case.

GEPHARDT ENTREATS GORE TO CONSIDER ANOTHER RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KEVIN MURPHY and STEVE KRASKE, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As if Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt weren't busy
enough trying to help Democrats take back the U.S. House this year,
he is now being mentioned as a possible savior of Al Gore's bid for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation ran full tilt Friday that Gore was seriously
considering Gephardt as his running mate, although late in the day
The Associated Press reported that Democratic officials were saying
that Gephardt had urged Gore in a private talk to pick someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said, however, that Gephardt was still a potential
pick. And with Gore's running mate decision just a few weeks away,
political analysts spent the day listing the pros and cons of the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The pros: Gephardt would help cement support from labor. He
would boost Gore's prospects of carrying Missouri, an important
swing state. And he could help ward off a growing threat from Green
Party nominee Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any high-stakes move, there are drawbacks. The
biggest: Gephardt would give the Democratic ticket a more liberal
bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would leave the center of the political spectrum
completely open to Mr. Compassionate Conservative,'' said
University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato about likely
GOP nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp has acknowledged that Gephardt, the House minority
leader, is on the vice president's short list. The two reportedly
held a secret meeting last Saturday at Gore's residence to discuss
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt hasn't ruled out sharing the ticket with Gore, but that
is not his priority, his press secretary, Sue Harvey, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you he is committed to running for re-election and
trying to take back the House,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted a Gephardt adviser saying the
Missourian had sought the Saturday meeting with Gore to point the
vice president in another direction. According to the adviser,
Gephardt's message to Gore was, ``If you really think I could make
a difference then we should have a conversation, but (taking a spot
on the ticket) would be a hard thing to do and I really think you
should look at other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has decided not to participate in the customary
candidate background check, according to a Gephardt adviser who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Gore said Gephardt's entreaty doesn't
necessarily mean he won't be asked to take the job, though the vice
president ``is aware of the downside'' to picking him.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has won praise as a tireless fund-raiser for Democrats
running for the House in an effort to erase the Republicans'
222-211 advantage. Running for vice president could seriously
undercut those chances, some observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an awful lot at stake in House races,'' said Charles
O. Jones, senior fellow of governmental studies for the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``It doesn't totally swing on Gephardt,
but he certainly has dedicated himself to that task.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who know Gephardt well question whether he would
consider trading away his years-long quest of becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in his heart of hearts he wants to be speaker
of the House,'' said Joe Carmichael, Missouri's Democratic
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The possible choice of Gephardt raises questions on other fronts
as well, Jones said. For one thing, Gephardt has broken with Gore
and President Clinton on some issues, such as NAFTA and trade with
China, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that Republicans may try to exploit those
differences, but that Gephardt could also help bring votes to Gore
from organized labor that backed him on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any erosion on the left or in the base of the
party, it shores that up,'' said Vic Kamber, a Democratic
strategist and president of a company that lobbies for labor.
Gephardt, who ran for president in 1988, has been scrutinized for
years and would not spring any surprises on Gore, Kamber said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato noted that many Democrats are terrified of losing votes
to Nader, the consumer advocate and Green Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader's moving up in the polls, not down,'' he said.
``Gephardt could help with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Gephardt may help draw traditional Democrats into the
Gore fold, he would do nothing to win over conservative Democrats
now leaning toward Bush, said David Israelite, political director
of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of problems Gore is having is with conservative
Democrats, not liberals,'' said Israelite. ``This would be a very
liberal ticket, a very Washington ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Gephardt is under consideration is that he is from
Missouri, a bellwether state that has sided with the winning
presidential candidate every election in the past century except
1956. A recent poll commissioned by The Kansas City Star shows Bush
leading Gore in Missouri by 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kamber said he did not think Missouri, even though historically
important, is a big enough prize to warrant Gore taking Gephardt as
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be thrilled if it would happen, but my first choice is
someone who can carry a big state,'' Kamber said.
</P>
<P>
   And given Bush's lead in Missouri, there's no guarantee Gephardt
could deliver the state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any great affection for Dick Gephardt outside of
St. Louis,'' said Missouri GOP spokesman Daryl Duwe.
</P>
<P>
   Without Gephardt, a slew of Democrats would find themselves
jockeying for position as the next Democratic leader. That could be
divisive at a time when Democrats need to unite to win the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an open race,'' acknowledged U.S. Rep. Karen
McCarthy, a Kansas City Democrat. ``It wouldn't be the smooth
transition that Al Gore is going to need as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential losses if Gephardt makes the run for vice
president would be his own House seat in suburban St. Louis, a
district in which Republicans figure to run strongly against a
newcomer.

FARMLAND INDUSTRIES REPORTS HIGHER QUARTERLY EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ERIC PALMER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Farmland Industries Inc. on Friday reported
net earnings of $37.1 million for its third quarter, ending May 31,
on sales of $3 billion. That gain compared with a $7.4 million loss
in the third quarter last year on sales of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, however, was attributable primarily to the $49.6
million Farmland received by selling off part of its marketing
operations to create a joint venture with two other cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of fiscal 2000, Farmland reported a
loss of $11.6 million, compared with a loss of $11.7 million in the
same period last year. Sales increased to $8.8 billion for nine
months, up from $7.8 billion in the same period the year before.
</P>
<P>
   While sales were up, the farm economy's depressed prices
continue to pressure Farmland's operations, Harry Cleberg,
president and chief executive of the Kansas City-based cooperative,
said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices on petroleum products resulted in a 54 percent
increase in sales and a $13.6 million increase in income over the
nine months for Farmland's petroleum business. The cooperative also
saw increases in refrigerated sales of meat, particularly beef,
Cleberg reported in a letter to members of the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland received nearly $50 million by selling a portion of its
farm marketing operations to create a joint venture with Cenex
Harvest States and Land O'Lakes. Called Agriliance, the venture has
offices in Kansas City and St. Paul, Minn. It markets fertilizer,
herbicides, seed and other products to independent retailers and to
farmers and ranchers who belong to all three cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said that talks were continuing with Cenex Harvest
States of Minnesota about reconsidering a merger but that there was
no timetable for such a move. Members of Farmland, the nation's
largest farmer-owner cooperative, last year overwhelmingly voted
for a merger, but Cenex members narrowly defeated it.
</P>
<P>
   Cenex is the country's second-largest farm cooperative.
Combined, Cenex and Farmland would have sales in excess of $18
billion. The cooperatives said combining could help them compete
against global food businesses and save them an estimated $500
million over six years.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the nine years since George Holliday, a Los Angeles plumber
standing on the balcony of his apartment, videotaped the vicious
police beating of Rodney King, tapes made by onlookers have become
a potent legal and political tool.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with two more beatings by police officers videotaped
by news helicopters in Philadelphia and in Lawrenceville, Ga., the
images are as powerful as ever, once again inspiring protesters who
say they are a uniquely vivid display of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But videotapes of police beatings are actually not so rare,
although few come to national attention. And a review of 18 recent
cases involving such tapes shows that the police officers captured
on film often face no criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   That is no surprise, prosecutors, defense lawyers and other
legal experts say, since bystander videotapes rarely present a
complete picture of an incident, often capturing only the last few
seconds of a violent chase or confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Facing videotapes in police brutality cases, therefore, defense
lawyers generally argue, as they did successfully in the first
prosecution growing out of the Rodney King beatings, that because
the video caught only a piece of the interaction, it missed the
context and the act of defiance that led to the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, hurried amateur tapes of violent attacks that last
seconds rarely provide clear views of precisely who is doing what,
even making it hard to tell which officer struck a particular blow.
For example, in the Philadelphia case, a frame-by-frame analysis of
the video by The Philadelphia Inquirer showed that the victim was
punched and kicked 59 times in 28 seconds before a supervisor
rushed in and backed the officers away.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes may come from a variety of sources. In a 1997 Pittsburgh
case, the beating of a motorist, Evan Gross, was automatically
recorded by a camera mounted on a patrol car. In a 1996 California
case, television news helicopters followed a wild 70-mile chase and
captured the 15-second beating of illegal immigrants piling out of
a rusty pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapes don't automatically lead to prosecution, because the
legal standard is one of reasonableness,'' said Austin Sarat, a
professor of law and political science at Amherst College. ``So
what appears to us on the outside as absolutely reprehensible,
might look to a prosecutor like bad behavior that, under the
circumstances, would not convince a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sarat said the easy availability of video cameras was a
positive development in helping to make cases against police
officers who were brutal, ``you can't just say, `Oh, gee, these
prosecutors should take these cases.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost every one of the incidents spurs local protests,
and if, as is often but not always the case, the police officers
are white and the victims black or Hispanic, the tapes rekindle
deep racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the most famous case growing out of a videotaped police
beating, an all-white jury in Simi Valley, Calif., acquitted the
four officers charged with beating Rodney King in March 1991. The
verdict set off riots that took more than 50 lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two of the officers were convicted in a federal court
of violating King's civil rights. And a year later, a Los Angeles
jury awarded King $3.8 million in damages for his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But many other cases never get to court:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1994 case in Compton, Calif., a police officer who was
sent to a trailer park to interview several siblings thought to be
neglected smashed the oldest child in the face with his baton, hit
him repeatedly after he fell to the ground, handcuffed the boy and
used the baton to drag him to a police car, a sequence videotaped
by the boy's godmother, a neighbor. The officer, Michael Jackson,
said that what the tape missed was that he had been threatened and
racially insulted by the boy, 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, and
struck by a younger sister. The district attorney did not charge
Jackson with any crime. A civil jury awarded Soltero, who suffered
a concussion but no broken bones, $1 in damages for the beating.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1997 Baltimore case, in which a bystander recorded the
fatal police shooting of James Quarles on a crowded August night at
the Lexington Market, the prosecutor said there was no probable
cause for manslaughter or murder charges. In the video, Quarles has
his back to the camera as four police officers point handguns at
him, so it is impossible to tell precisely what he is doing, but it
is clear that he has a knife in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1998 case in Broward County, Fla., a grand jury would not
indict a Fort Lauderdale police officer of any wrongdoing in what
appeared to be beating of a schizophrenic man, John Clements,
videotaped by two Polish tourists. The grand jury was apparently
unconvinced that it had enough information about what had happened
off-camera. But Clements later settled his civil claims against the
city for $210,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a 1997 Pittsburgh case, state troopers were videotaped
beating Evan Gross after a car chase. In the tape, Gross is seen
getting out of the car with his hands up and being ordered to lie
on the ground, where troopers swarmed over him, punching and
kneeing him. An Allegheny County grand jury, citing testimony from
two police experts in the use of force, decided not to recommend
filing excessive-force charges against any of the troopers, and the
police officers were permitted to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   In those and other cases, lawyers for the beating victims say,
the videotape did not overcome a presumption in favor of the police
_ or the sense that what took place before the tape began rolling
would provide a legitimate explanation for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors and police officers work together all the time,''
said Stewart Greenberg, the lawyer for Clements in Fort Lauderdale.
``No one wants to believe a police officer would ever do anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clements case, Greenberg said, the tape did not stand up
to the officer's lawyer's argument that without knowing what
happened off-camera, it was unfair to charge his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense lawyer's argument is always going to be that the
tape started at X moment, but missed the crucial moment that came
earlier, at X minus 5,'' said Peter Kirchheimer, supervising
attorney at the Federal Defenders Division of the Legal Aid
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, videotapes are a massive political fact,'' Kirchheimer
added. ``Normally, the criminal justice system is pretty opaque,
and people don't see what happened. Charges don't usually get
brought against the police unless there's egregious injuries like
the perforated rectum in the Louima case _ or a videotape. They're
the thousand-pound elephant, and they change the whole balance.''
</P>
<P>
   As they make their way through the criminal justice system, the
newest cases may face the same problems as their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Philadelphia television stations repeatedly played
the tapes of a group of police officers beating and kicking a man
accused of stealing a police car and shooting at officers in a
mile-long chase. The suspect, Thomas Jones, was treated for five
bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the King case, in which the police were white and the
victim black, the Philadelphia case involved both black and white
officers. While the tapes vividly show a group of police officers
beating Jones, a 6-foot, 240-pound ex-convict, they do not show how
the incident began: The police say that Jones, who was first
stopped for driving a stolen car, and fled on foot, then grabbed an
officer's gun, began shooting and jumped into a nearby patrol car
to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes show that the guy was subdued, and thereafter
assaulted,'' said Chet Mirsky, a professor of criminal law at New
York University. ``You see the guy down on the ground, being
gratuitously kicked, on a continual basis, by more than one police
officer. But in thinking about what's excessive force, you have to
remember that this is a dangerous person, that anyone in their
right mind would have reason to fear. My guess is that it probably
won't get prosecuted, unless there's just enormous public hue and
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in Lawrenceville, Ga., a news helicopter taped
police officers punching and kicking a drunken driving suspect,
Marshall Dwight Studdard, as he lay on the ground after a 20-minute
chase. But because Studdard is obscured by an officer on the tape,
it is difficult, in that tape, too, to determine what he was doing
during the beating.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just in prosecuting police beatings that
videotapes are becoming a factor. Banks and convenience stores have
long taped their transactions to deter crime. And as video cameras
are more widely used, tapes of public events are becoming almost
ubiquitous, whether of the Justice Department's removal of Elian
Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home, or the recent sexual
violence in New York's Central Park after the National Puerto Rican
Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amateur videotapes are everywhere,'' said Paul Chevigny, a
professor at New York University Law School. ``Look at what
happened in Central Park; they came up with something like 27
videotapes. It's true people are more likely to have cameras at a
parade, but it's also a measure of how much videotaping is out
there now.''

POLITICAL MEDDLING IN PUMP PRICES BAD FOR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY HEASTER KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Why did gasoline prices retreat as suddenly
as they surged? Did the recent unexpected relief result from market
forces or industry reaction to political threats?
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to believe politics didn't play some part in the
pump-price plunge, but before anyone celebrates, here's something
to keep in mind: The price mechanism is critical to a steady supply
of any good or service.
</P>
<P>
   If the industry was indeed cowed by saber-rattling politicians,
the short-term pocketbook benefit may come at a much higher
long-term cost in terms of both price and supply.
</P>
<P>
   The petroleum-industry reality is that when motorists were
enjoying historically low prices in the late '90s, those in the
gasoline-selling business were experiencing their hardest times in
a decade. The industry's difficulty generating adequate returns on
its capital explains why refining capacity has been static for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   There were varied reasons for the recent gasoline price spike,
but to the extent it enhanced the industry's profits, it could have
been a good thing as an incentive to expand refining capacity. The
reaction from consumers and their elected representatives, however,
did not send an encouraging message. It said, in essence, any price
development that might improve your return on capital to the point
of encouraging new refinery construction will be met with public
and political disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere down the road, Americans are going to reap a load of
hassle for their shortsightedness when it comes to energy
economics. The fact that government is mandating gasoline
reformulation to fight pollution probably means the day of
reckoning will come sooner than otherwise would be the case.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not what most Americans want to hear,
because so many of us consider cheap fuel a birthright. This
national attitude translates into more bad public policy. The
president's recent reaction to a predicted heating fuel shortage
this winter is the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   The president has ordered the creation of a home heating-oil
reserve for New England and is seeking legislation allowing
distribution of the heating-oil reserve if prices soar. This sounds
good, but it's the sort of government action that skews the
market's allocative function.
</P>
<P>
   First, the threat of price-depressing intervention in the market
might discourage refiners from increasing supplies if a
colder-than-usual winter is expected. If, on the other hand, the
industry does decide to increase heating-oil supplies, this will
divert some gasoline refining capacity to heating-oil production,
which could force pump prices to soar again this summer.
</P>
<P>
   No outcome can be predicted with certainty, but one thing is
certain: The more government meddles, the more industry makes its
decisions trying to anticipate policy initiatives instead of
marketplace supply-demand developments.
</P>
<P>
   As the price mechanism is short-circuited, resources won't be
put to their most valued use. In the short term, supply patterns
are distorted. In the long run, the capital needed to expand
refining capacity will remain scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Government can do many things, but what it can't do is force
businesses to operate at a loss or commit capital to unpromising
investments.
</P>

FAA REACHES COMPROMISE WITH MOST PILOTS ON SAFETY PROCEDURES TO
EASE DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the worst month of delays in air traffic
history, airline pilots and the Federal Aviation Administration
Friday ended a safety dispute that led pilots to sometimes refuse a
specific kind of land instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines said the refusal by pilots to use the procedure
added substantially to delays at airports in Chicago and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involved a procedure called ``land and hold short
operations,'' under which controllers clear a plane to land using
only part of a runway, because another plane will be landing or
taking off on another runway that crosses the first one. The
procedure had been in use since 1968, but in April the FAA
announced it would broaden use of the procedure, and some pilots
unions said the changes raised the chance that planes would
collide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Air Transport Association, the trade
association of the big carriers, the refusal by pilots to land
under the procedure was responsible for 25 percent of the delays in
Boston and 10 percent at O'Hare, in Chicago. Miami and Honolulu
were also affected by the action.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots unions often raise safety concerns to the FAA, but in
this case, some unions took the unusual step of recommending to
their members that they use ``discretion'' in deciding whether to
accept clearances to land under the procedure. Many of them began
refusing such clearances, adding to delays at busy airports with
runways that intersect.
</P>
<P>
   At the FAA, Ronald Morgan, the director of Air Traffic, said,
``where demand is high, it's going to decrease delays.''
</P>
<P>
   At United Airlines, which uses O'Hare as a hub and which in June
recorded an on-time performance of less than 57 percent, Peter
McDonald, the vice president of operational services, said, ``not
using it had a significant effect on our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is used only when there is little wind, when the
runways are dry and when visibility is good. McDonald said, ``It's
a good-weather procedure, but since we can't use it even on good
days, it is like bad weather all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the union raised a variety of safety questions. One was
whether the pilots of private planes, or pilots for foreign
airlines, could be trusted to understand instructions to stop in
the middle of the runway, without proof that they had been trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm landing full length on the runway, I need some
assurance that another pilot who has been told to land and hold
short of my runway knows how to do that,'' said Capt. Paul
McCarthy, executive air safety chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Union, the largest union. ``How do we verify and document that the
other pilot has the requisite level of training, and how can a
controller tell the difference?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, under a compromise, controllers can order two airliners
to land on intersecting runways, or two private planes; they cannot
order a private plane and an airliner to land on intersecting
runways.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, the union and the government have agreed
that controllers will stop using the procedure on a handful of
intersecting runways that the union believes have not yet been
adequately analyzed for the risk of collision if one of the planes,
as sometimes happens, fails to land but circles instead. So far no
incidents have been reported as a result of the procedure's use.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are always in charge of their aircraft, and whether to
accept a clearance from air traffic control, for landing or
takeoff, is always up to them. McCarthy said his union would be
advising its members that any clearance now offered by controllers
would be in accordance with the union's criteria, and that he, too,
was glad if the result was to allow more landings and takeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're job-dependent, and capacity means jobs to pilots,'' he
said. But, he added, ``my job is not to increase capacity: My job
is to operate the airplane from Point A to Point B, in the safest
possible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for some other unions also agreed to the compromise.
Some airlines, however, have never accepted the clearances for the
procedure and will not do so now. For example, Southwest Airlines
flies mostly to smaller airports, and has not trained its pilots to
use the procedure. Controllers are not supposed to offer the
clearances to Southwest planes, and if they do, pilots are supposed
to decline them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 28 days of June the airlines reported 44,000
delays, up from 38,000 in the same period a year earlier. Weather
was the biggest cause, and McCarthy noted that the FAA does not
keep track of how many landings and takeoffs are performed using
the procedure.  &QL;

AFTER RELUCTANT `YES' TO MINISTRY, CONFIDENT CLIMB TO TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Md., D.C., Ariz.)   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ She knelt down in her stiff new robe stitched with
purple and gold brocade, surrounded by a tight circle of four
bishops and five elders. One by one, they laid their hands on the
crown of her head in a mighty stack, consecrating her as the first
woman bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinch me,'' the Rev. Vashti Murphy McKenzie of Baltimore says
she told herself. ``It's really happening, but it seems unreal. All
I was saying was, `Let's not cry now. Let's cry later. Don't cry
here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When she stood, she was dry-eyed, but many of the 5,000 or so
church members watching at the convention center here were not. Men
and women streamed down the aisles to get close enough to snap
pictures of the new bishop, bathing her in a benediction of
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   The laying on of hands happened at 1:02 a.m. Wednesday after
seven days of campaigning at the church's quadrennial convention.
At 3:15 a.m., she was still in the convention center, meeting with
the pastors and lay leaders from the district where she will serve
her first four years: the 18th, which covers Mozambique, Lesotho,
Botswana and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to move to her district in Africa with her husband,
Stan McKenzie, a former NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the AME Church could not elect a woman as bishop
because the churches in Africa _ home to about a third of the 2.5
million AME members _ were not ready to accept a woman's
leadership. But McKenzie said that, to the contrary, some African
delegates had asked her to come to their districts if she was
elected. They told her they could use the experience she had gained
in Baltimore developing programs to help the uneducated,
unemployed, or those with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of placing my gender in front of me, I'll place who I
am and what I do, and who I serve in front of me,'' she said in an
interview. ``They know I'm a woman when I walk in the door. So
what? I've been one all my life. Get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, who says she is in the 50s, is a fitting first. Tall
and regal, her bearing recalls the runway modeling she did as a
teen-ager. Professional and prepared, in her campaign for bishop
she had the glossiest brochure of any of the 42 candidates, the
brightest red T-shirts on her supporters and the slickest video
promoting her accomplishments in 10 years as pastor at Payne
Memorial AME in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is qualified to be bishop, forget the gender,'' said the
Rev. Richard Greene, a pastor from Maryland who joined a huddle of
20 men in the convention center praying passionately for her
victory minutes before the final vote. ``She cares about people,
and finds the best in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a country boy,'' and quite traditional, Greene said,
``but I believe in her. She has always been there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of her purple and gold robe sank in, McKenzie
said she looked back over her life ``and realized that all of it
was the preparation for this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry was not her first career. Initially, she went into
journalism, the family business. Her great-grandfather, John H.
Murphy Sr., had founded The Afro-American newspaper in 1892, when
very few blacks were literate, she said. She honed her writing at
The Arizona Republic and The Afro-American, which still publishes
in Baltimore and Washington. She cultivated her speaking skills as
a broadcaster on gospel radio.
</P>
<P>
   But when the first of her three children was born 25 years ago,
she faced a crisis, she said. She had heard the call to ministry.
She fasted. She prayed. And she said she resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a very frightening thing when all of a sudden you
realize God is calling you to preach,'' McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   There were only one or two women she knew in the ministry then,
she said, and no books on how to do it. Few mentors. She went ahead
and earned her master of divinity degree from Howard University in
Washington and her doctorate of ministry from Union Theological
Seminary in Dayton, Ohio. Her first assignment was to a church with
seven members.
</P>
<P>
   When the pastor of Payne Memorial died in 1989, church insiders
buzzed about who would fill that prestigious pulpit. At a church
gathering, Bishop H.H. Brookins called McKenzie aside and told her
he wanted to assign her to Payne.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that he asked her, `` `Can you handle the pressure,
because if you are not successful, it will be a long time before a
woman will be given a major pulpit again.' said I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Her church was the first in Maryland to join the welfare reform
effort by winning a $1.5 million state contract to open a job
training center, in 1997. The church's nonprofit affiliate took
over a failing public school. It bought a five-story apartment
building and an office building to house the church's youth and
senior programs, computer classes and a catering service that
employs former welfare recipients. The church grew to 1,700 members
from 300.
</P>
<P>
   She says she follows the ``Ten Commandments for Women Leaders''
that she composed in her book ``Not Without a Struggle'' (United
Church Press, 1996). The first commandment is: ``Thou shalt not
forsake one's femininity for the sake of one's position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see beautiful women stripping themselves of their
femininity just to be able to hold a position of power,'' McKenzie
said. ``I believe you don't have to give up your femininity. Esther
may have been a good-looking woman and that may have gotten her an
interview with the king, but it was her character that earned her
the crown, and it was her relationship with God that saved her
people.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's very feminine approach to power was on display at the
convention. She was campaigning when she found herself in a
too-long embrace with a churchgoer who said he had heard her preach
(she has topped Ebony Magazine's ``15 Greatest Female Preachers
List'').
</P>
<P>
   ``You came to see us, and I remember you,'' the man gushed,
``because you're so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As he planted a sloppy kiss on her cheek, she never lost her
composure.

SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS SEEK BETTER PAY AND WORK CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yvonne Christensen approaches her job like a
stand-up comedian. ``You've got about 15 seconds to grab 'em,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Fletcher sees it as similar to being a relief pitcher:
when you walk onto the mound, players are already on base.
</P>
<P>
   And Cindy Manzo sounds as if she's joined the circus: ``I'll
stand on a chair, I'll dance around, I'll pretend my shoe is a
phone,'' Manzo said of her 15 years as a substitute teacher in
three states. ``Anything to keep their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   These three longtime substitutes were among 50 who exchanged
horror stories and survival strategies here at the first national
conference of substitute teachers Friday, part of an effort to
raise pay, benefits and working conditions for what is perhaps
education's least respected teaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent effort, organized by far-flung substitutes who met
over the Internet, comes at a time of severe shortage of substitute
teachers. With student enrollment and teacher absenteeism growing,
class size shrinking and the unemployment rate near record lows,
school districts across the country are scrambling to fill gaps at
the front of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts have raised wages, but others have lowered
requirements: in half the states, all it takes to be a substitute
teacher is a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Substitutes have long been disrespected by students, teachers
and administrators, and largely ignored by researchers and
politicians. But students, on average, spend a full year of their
school lives in classes taught by substitutes, a fact that has
fueled a small, but growing, movement to improve training for these
workers and take their role more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving a car: it's skill-based,'' said Geoffrey
Smith, executive director of the Substitute Teaching Institute at
Utah State University, which has made a CD-ROM that provides a
self-taught seminar for potential recruits. ``There are skills that
one can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that fewer than 10 percent of school districts
provided training for substitutes, but those that did found it
decreased the number of complaints and attracted more applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Expert estimates of the number of substitutes range from 500,000
to 1 million, but nearly everyone agrees there are not enough. In a
recent survey by Smith's institute, 86 percent of school districts
reported a substitute teacher shortage, with more than half calling
it a ``serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay varies widely, from $30 to $185 a day, with an average of
about $65. Qualifications also vary: Some districts require a
full-fledged teaching credential, others simply do a criminal
background check.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the ranks of substitutes were filled with teachers
unable to find full-time work, retirees and parents helping out in
their children's schools. But now, as the nation faces a teacher
shortage of an estimated 2.5 million in the next decade, substitute
rosters are bare, and districts are turning to flight attendants,
firefighters, college students and others.
</P>
<P>
   The full-employment economy, where potential substitute teachers
might make better money flipping burgers, is not helping. Nor is
the rise in the number of professional development days that pull
full-time teachers out of class. Assistant principals, and even
schools superintendents, are having to fill in during shortages,
and some districts ask cafeteria workers and bus drivers to serve
as subs. Last November, the Kelly Services temporary agency began
providing substitute teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlanta suburbs of DeKalb County, full-time high school
teachers can earn an extra $15 for teaching during their planning
periods. When Georgia passed a law slashing the number of teachers'
aides statewide, the district also decided to turn 600 aides into
substitutes this fall rather than fire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious thing to do is to pay more money,'' said Franklin
Grant, director of the office of human resources at the
97,000-student DeKalb County school system, and president of the
American Association of School Personnel Administrators. ``How do
you get a commitment out of anybody for $30 or $40 a day?''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has provided fertile ground for organizing efforts.
The National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers each represents substitute teachers in a handful of cities
and towns; substitutes have also affiliated with other labor
groups, including Service Employees International Union and the
United Food and Commercial Workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, legislators recently passed the eighth in a series of
bills focused on substitute teachers, setting pay scales at 85
percent of a district's average teacher salary. In Michigan, the
state teachers' association has adopted a substitute's ``bill of
rights'' calling for health benefits, a safe environment and ``the
dignity and respect that, as professional educators, they have
earned.''
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker at Friday's conference was Shirley Kirsten,
founder of the Fresno Area Substitute Teachers Association in
California. The group began with five people having coffee in her
living room in 1997, and ended up negotiating a contract last year
on behalf of hundreds of substitutes that raised pay for
substitutes to $80 or $90 a day, from $65, depending on the
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been isolated for too long,'' Kirsten told attendees,
who had come from Nebraska, Florida, New York, Oregon, North
Carolina and Virginia. ``We now need to get together under one
umbrella. That umbrella is respect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of those attending the conference were longtime substitutes
with teaching credentials, many of them having chosen the
flexibility of daily assignments over the responsibilities of a
full-time classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Manzo, who is 52, said substituting fit with her military
husband's mobility _ they have relocated 18 times _ and enables her
to care more easily for her son and her father, both of whom have
medical conditions requiring her attention.
</P>
<P>
   But substituting can mean teaching French and physics and fourth

HMO DEAL SHUFFLES MEMBERS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ United Health Group has signed an agreement for
its United HealthCare unit to transfer its California health plan
membership of about 225,000 people to Blue Shield of California,
both companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Blue Shield will also provide access to its
network of more than 42,000 physicians and medical facilities to
Uniprise, a separate unit that serves about 700,000 employees and
their dependents in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal means our presence in this state will increase by
about a million members,'' said David Joyner, vice president of
external affairs with San Francisco-based Blue Shield. ``It has
also given their members access to a more extensive health care
network.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer agreement primarily involves those individuals
covered by United HealthCare in California. Employees and their
dependents will continue to be served by Uniprise, which is
expanding its programs in California through its new alliance with
Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   This transfer does not affect AARP members in California who
have Medicare supplement or hospital indemnity coverage through
Minneapolis-based United Health Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a business decision to partner with Blue Shield
to serve a group of members that are in small- to middle-market
employer groups and shift our focus to our larger multistate and
multisite business,'' said Roger Cruzen, vice president of public
relations for United HealthCare.
</P>
<P>
   The transition is subject to regulatory review. United
HealthCare expects the transfer of its members to Blue Shield to
begin by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, however, call the agreement outrageous and
want state regulators to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care companies should not be able to trade their
patients like children trading baseball cards on a playground,''
said Jamie Court, director of the Santa Monica-based Consumers for
Quality Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``United HealthCare has made certain promises to their members,
and now they are trying to change those promises,'' Court said.
``If the state won't stop the deal, I know a few class-action
lawyers that will.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Blue Shield and United HealthCare emphasized that all
consumers affected by the transition will receive uninterrupted
coverage and access to care.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said Blue Shield has done everything to make sure there
would be no disruptions in service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 95 percent of United physicians are already in our
network,'' he said. ``We have additional providers that they don't
even have. We are going to work through any dislocations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Joyner said, ``We are confident we will get a swift
review by the state Department of Managed Health Care.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruzen said United HealthCare's reason for seeking a deal was
simple: The company's health plans were only breaking even in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get beyond that position would have required a lot more
investment,'' he said. ``We could have left the state entirely, so
instead we have found a partner that is aligned with our philosophy
of delivering health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Shield of California, an independent member of the Blue
Shield Association, is California's second largest not-for-profit
health plan. Blue Shield has a membership of 2.1 million and annual
revenue of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of United Health Group closed down $1.25, or 1.5 percent,
Friday to $84.50 on heavy volume of 1,437,300 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

JAPANESE BANKRUPTCY STIRS WIDER DOUBTS ON ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The gloom surrounding the bankruptcy of the Sogo Co., a
major retailer that owes more than $17 billion, was dispelled
somewhat Friday after Japan's finance minister said the failure
would not undercut the economic recovery and Standard &AMP; Poor's
called the bankruptcy necessary medicine for the Japanese banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs that another big Japanese corporate
debtor, worried about suffering the same fate as Sogo, might be
bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   And there was speculation that the financial weaknesses exposed
by the Sogo bankruptcy and its aftermath might dissuade the Bank of
Japan from raising interest rates at its policy meeting on Monday.
Up until the Sogo collapse, there had been considerable expectation
that the central bank was prepared to raise rates for the first
time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sogo, an operator of 25 department stores and an employer of
10,000 people, sought bankruptcy protection Wednesday after a
public outcry over a government-backed plan to use taxpayer money
to keep the company alive and forgive some of its debts amassed
during the speculative boom years in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout plan collapsed after Shinsei Bank, a big Sogo
creditor that was recently bought by foreign investors, balked at
forgiving any Sogo debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Sogo bankruptcy, one of the biggest in Japan, could now
create a domino chain of failures among Sogo suppliers and others
dependent on the 170-year-old retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese finance minister, offered some
reassurance that the impact of Sogo's collapse would be limited.
``I don't think it would be substantial as the economy is
rebounding,'' he told a news conference in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's also eased some of the anxiety about Sogo,
calling the decision to abandon a bailout a positive step. ``While
Sogo's reversal may lead to an immediate increased incidence of
corporate bankruptcy, the long-term effects may be more beneficial
for the Japanese banking industry,'' the ratings agency said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Japanese news reports said Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank, one of the biggest banks, was planning to help the
Hazama Corp., a major construction company, avoid what had befallen
Sogo. The reports said the bank might buy some of the debts that
Hazama owed to Shinsei _ the same bank that helped precipitate
Sogo's bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Should Dai-Ichi take on Sogo's Shinsei loans, that would send a
clear signal that the system of so-called convoy capitalism is
still alive in Japan. That system, in which banks lend to borrowers
to keep them afloat rather than make a profit, was supposed to have
died after the financial crisis that nearly toppled the banking
system here in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, new data on bankruptcies released Friday suggests that
one of the biggest challenges the government will face this year is
how to prevent insolvency from tipping the banking system into
another crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the law that make it easier for companies to seek
court protection have helped increase bankruptcies to nearly record
highs. Corporate bankruptcies rose 32.2 percent in the first six
months of this year compared with the same period last year, as
9,304 companies went under, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit
research company.
</P>
<P>
   Hazama owes Shinsei 42 billion yen, or about $388 million, and
Japanese newspapers said Dai-Ichi was preparing to buy the 30
billion yen of those loans not covered by Shinsei's reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Dai-Ichi was careful Friday not to deny the stories. ``We are
the main bank of Hazama, and our policy is we would like to support
the company,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no decision had been made to buy Hazama's Shinsei loans.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a broad request for 105 billion yen in debt relief
from four banks, Hazama has already asked Shinsei to forgive 12
billion yen to 15 billion yen in loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sogo had made a similar request as part of a broad restructuring
plan, but Shinsei refused to go along. Instead, Shinsei asked the
government to take on its loans to Sogo under terms of an agreement
reached last year that put the bank into the hands of a group of
foreign investors headed by Ripplewood Holdings LLC.
</P>
<P>
   The government first agreed to forgive Sogo's Shinsei debts, but
politicians, facing a torrent of public criticism, abandoned the
plan, forcing Sogo into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a possibility that the Hazama's story could play out
the same way. But Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
strong reasons to keep construction companies like Hazama afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The ties between the Liberal Democrats and the construction
industry are legendary. Much of the spending on public works that
has contributed to Japan's huge public debt load is a reflection of
those ties, as are the piles of debt accumulated by construction
companies struggling to survive during the economic downturn of the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies keep people employed, and that employment
is translated into votes. And Japan is forever awash in rumors of
kickbacks between politicians and general contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks want this debt-forgiveness plan, because if Hazama
goes through a public bankruptcy process, various types of
collusion between the construction industry, politics and the
bureaucracy might surface,'' said Yoshito Sengoku, a member of
Parliament from the opposition Democratic Party, who played a major
role in shaping the bailout of the banking system in late 1997 and
early 1998.

DAVID BLECHMAN, CO-FOUNDER OF NUTRITION COMPANY, DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla.)   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Blechman, a co-founder of the Twinlab Corp., a nutritional
supplement company that has grown with America's health
consciousness over 30 years, died July 7 at New York Presbyterian
Hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and divided his time between
Commack, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He died after complications from heart bypass surgery, a
spokesman for Twinlab said.
</P>
<P>
   Blechman founded Twinlab, based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., with his
wife, Jean, and named it for their two sets of twin sons. The
Blechmans later had a fifth son, and eventually the entire family
worked for the business.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 interview with The New York Times, Ross Blechman, who
became chief executive of Twinlab when his father retired four
years ago, said the business began in 1968 with a liquid protein
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years later, Dr. Robert Linn wrote a book called `The
Last Chance Diet,' which involved a lot of liquid protein, and we
were swept up in the craze,'' the younger Blechman said.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company markets hundreds of vitamins, minerals, herbs
and sports nutrition products. Its worldwide sales are more than
$300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   David Blechman was born Sept. 22, 1923, in Brooklyn. He attended
Long Island University until he was drafted into the Army during
World War II and served with the Army Medical Corps in Europe.
After the war, he became a pharmaceutical salesman.
</P>
<P>
   With his sons approaching college age, Blechman realized he
could not afford tuition and took a gamble starting his own
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He figured he could always go back to the sales job and be
broke again,'' Ross Blechman said.
</P>
<P>
   David Blechman is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former
Jean Leopold; his brother, Dr. Harry Blechman of Manhattan; five
sons, Ross, Dean and Neil, of Setauket, N.Y.; Steve, of Poquott,
N.Y., and Brian, of Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.; and 10 grandchildren. &QL;

FLIGHT DELAYS SOAR THIS SUMMER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Mihalik just wanted to fly home to
Pittsburgh, but his United Airlines plane was already 30 minutes
late boarding at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of trips out have been very bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a previous trip, it took him 16 hours to get from Pittsburgh
to San Francisco because of airport delays, and he was beginning to
fear that this trip home might not be any better.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one playing the waiting game at America's
airports. Because of bad weather in the Midwest on Friday, several
flights were delayed at LAX, leaving passengers sitting stone-faced
and stoic, hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
</P>
<P>
   And airport delays are on the rise, according to new Federal
Aviation Administration figures.
</P>
<P>
   In June, delays in the nation's air traffic control system
jumped 16.5 percent over the previous year. Some 48,448 flights
were delayed 79 percent of them because of weather, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   June was a particularly active month for thunderstorms, the FAA
said. On several days of the month, a solid line of thunderstorms
reaching from Toronto to Dallas disrupted schedules. On June 27,
the Aviation Weather Center of the National Weather Service issued
a record 281 warnings of thunderstorm activity.
</P>
<P>
   While the weather caused havoc, delays caused by the volume of
aircraft actually decreased 5.2 percent, the FAA said. And delays
due to air traffic control equipment outages were down 78.8
percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Although FAA officials say there were delays in fewer than 1
percent of the more than 7 million flights in June, travelers
booked on the delayed flights may not have felt consoled.
</P>
<P>
   John Crowder of Washington, D.C., said delayed flights cut his
productivity, but that he has come to expect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful. You can't plan to get somewhere and do business
that same day. You have to plan to get there the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitor displaying arrival and departure information showed
Crowder's plane was arriving on time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it. It's beautiful!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Newman was trying to get home to Honolulu after a
business trip. She was ticketed for a plane that had been delayed
four hours. She was on standby for one delayed two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said she was running late for the second time in a week.
On her previous flight from Boston to Honolulu, she wound up
sitting in San Francisco for an unscheduled eight-hour layover.
</P>
<P>
   And Heide Woolley, a teacher from the Monterey Peninsula, was
trying to get to Ohio for a class reunion. Her plane was running
nearly two hours late, and she feared she would miss her connection
and either get to Ohio very late or have to spend the night in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to my 40th-year class reunion, and I don't want to
get there blurry-eyed,'' Woolley said.

RELIGION: A CLOSER LOOK AT EVANGELICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Count on it: The Religious Right will be back. In about two
weeks, the Republican National Convention will anoint George W.
Bush's choice of a running mate, and depending on that choice,
conservative religious leaders will be featured in the news, either
voicing praise and support or expressing disappointment and
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But how closely do those leaders' views, often partisan and
sometimes downright inflammatory, correspond to the outlook of the
nation's conservative Christians? A considerable body of critical
opinion, no less inflammatory itself, has assumed that the
correspondence is close. As Pat Robertson or James Dobson goes, so
go the evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Military metaphors abound in commentary on the Religious Right.
Not just the prominent leaders and their organized cadres but the
mass of conservative believers are often portrayed as an angry army
on the march, legions of intolerant zealots eager to use
governmental power to impose their favored moral order on the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of
North Carolina, is blunt about such sweeping portraits. ``Most of
those who disparage evangelicals in general terms really don't know
what they are talking about,'' he writes in his latest book,
``Christian America? What Evangelicals Really Want'' (University of
California, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Few critics, Smith says, ``have significant personal
relationships with enough ordinary evangelicals to inform their
views.'' Typically the critics' views spring from characterizations
in news articles and popular entertainment, from hoary mythology of
the Elmer Gantry sort, from the newsletters and fund-raising
appeals of organizations engaged in today's cultural wars, or from
the impressions of people just like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's previous book, ``American Evangelicalism: Embattled
and Thriving'' (University of Chicago, 1998), his extensive polling
and interviews challenged the widespread stereotype that
evangelicalism only flourished in intellectual and economic
backwaters, isolated enclaves guarded from what Walter Lippmann
famously called the ``acids of modernity.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Smith found that by most standards, measuring contact
with this elusive thing called modernity _ years of higher
education, employment patterns, income levels, urban versus rural
residence, age or sex _ people who identify themselves as
evangelical Christians scarcely differed from other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His new book is based on a three-year national study involving
over 200 extended interviews as well as polling data. He quickly
identifies four fallacies that have distorted many descriptions of
evangelicals: that their views can be equated with those of a
supposedly united evangelical political elite; that their views are
accurately represented by the formulations used in public opinion
polling; that their views are ideologically consistent, and that
they form a monolithic religious bloc rather than a conglomeration
of often bickering subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   In his own interviews, Smith did not shy from the hot-button
questions. Did evangelicals want to restore a ``Christian
America?'' What did they think of moral and cultural diversity? Did
they have a duty to save neighbors of other faiths from hell? What
could and could not _ or should not _be attempted through politics?
What should be the content of public education in a pluralist
society? What about male leadership in the family and equality
between men and women?
</P>
<P>
   On all of these questions he found a range of views, including
extreme ones. That, in fact, was his first important discovery:
that evangelicals were not united or monolithic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith found the bulk of evangelicals grouped around
certain convictions.
</P>
<P>
   They were deeply committed to freedom of religion and speech,
not simply as a matter of unavoidable compromise but out of their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   They believed strongly in individual change, personal conversion
of the heart, and consequently they remained wary of social
movements, political involvement and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than politics, they stressed personal example and
loving gestures, including prayer, as a means to change.
</P>
<P>
   They frequently disagreed with the positions of their most
visible political leaders and often said so quite explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   They were critical of their own failures to live up to the
Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   These views were typically conveyed in rambling statements, not
particularly eloquent, circling around in second thoughts and near
contradictions, statements too long and too loose-jointed to serve
reporters in need of the pebble-hard sound-bite, but statements
with the authentic ring of ordinary people reflecting and not
leaders posturing.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a woman, 54 years old, Midwestern and middle-class, who
thinks that gays, the National Organization of Women and the news
media are all hostile to Christianity, and who once marched outside
an abortion clinic. But she has ``mixed feeling,'' she says, about
the ``back-and-forth yelling thing'' and says ``one-on-one
evangelism'' is ``far better than this group stuff where you're so
militant and radical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really frown on evangelicals that are kind of hostile
themselves,'' she says. ``You don't win people that way. You've got
to love them first. We should just stand firm in our beliefs, of
course, but try to reach them in a loving way, try to talk to them
and befriend them, rather than go and just start yelling things
back and forth. What does that accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in what you call `hard-sell' Christianity,''
she says, with much elaboration. ``I don't believe in preaching at
people. I invite them to Christian things, and if the conversation
can be such that I can talk to them about Jesus, I do that. I never
hit anyone over the head with the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   American evangelicals ``are neither angels nor demons,'' Smith
concludes. ``They are much too diverse, complex, ambivalent and
inconsistent for that.'' Most are not particularly interested in
waging the culture wars. They are neither apostles of multicultural
diversity nor shock troops of intolerance. They are susceptible to
demagogy but also resistant to it, in much the same ways as other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The oratory surrounding political conventions sometimes leaves
the impression of a citizenry divided into alien species. Smith's
book argues that it just isn't so.

IN DEMOCRATIC AREA OF MICHIGAN, GORE ENCOUNTERS SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Sheila Redman, director of the Saginaw Art
Museum, put it best. ``I feel kind of bad in asking this,'' she
said to the vice president of the United States. ``But where have
you been for the past eight years?''
</P>
<P>
   This is a solidly Democratic, heavily unionized area, the buckle
of Michigan's industrial belt. But as in the rest of this state,
and much of the industrial Midwest, voters here are skeptical about
Al Gore's presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday night, for 3 1/2 hours, Gore stood under the hot
lights in the sweltering gymnasium of Arthur Hill High School here,
patiently answering questions from 200 voters _ many of them
undecided _ on the economy, jobs, trade and the insurgent campaign
of Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Redman's questioning that seemed to strike at the
heart of the issue. Noting that she was only suddenly aware of his
campaign, she told Gore: ``I wasn't sure I would vote for you. I
didn't know if you were strong enough to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the areas where Nader and his anti-corporate
third-party candidacy is siphoning votes from Gore. It may seem odd
that Nader, author of ``Unsafe At Any Speed'' and the longtime
nemesis of the auto industry, could make a dent in the support of
the AFL-CIO-backed Democratic candidate here. But Gore, who as
Republicans like to say, once proposed elimination of the
internal-combustion engine, carries a heavily anti-automobile
reputation, too.
</P>
<P>
   With Nader in the race, according to the latest statewide poll
by The Detroit Free Press, Gore trails Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, his likely Republican rival, by 12 percentage points. The
poll gave Bush 46 percent, Gore 34 and Nader 8.
</P>
<P>
   In the same poll two months ago, before Nader became a factor,
Gore was leading Bush. The Democrats have spent $1.2 million in
television commercials here since then to try to raise Gore's
stock, but to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader is only part of the problem. Gore backers and analysts
say that as the election heats up after Labor Day and Nader's
bare-bones campaign competes for media attention, he may become
less of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   For voters like Redman, the main concern is that despite Gore's
nearly eight years as vice president and his yearlong presidential
campaign, he is still an unknown quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is fully aware that the vice president
``hasn't broken through'' with voters, as one Gore adviser put it.
And on Thursday night, he revived one of his favorite campaign
venues, the town hall meeting, an open-ended give-and-take with
voters that allows Gore to display his grasp of issues and, more
important, to try to convey to voters who he his.
</P>
<P>
   While Redman did not mention President Clinton, Gore immediately
interpreted her concern as one about his toiling in the shadow as a
No. 2. He told her that the job of vice president was a ``mixed
blessing.'' The ideal person for the job, he told her, was someone
who would not care about receiving press attention and who would
help ``carry the load when the load gets heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``You may not always notice that man. And if you
do, he may be just standing there stiffly behind the president, not
saying a word.''
</P>
<P>
   He pressed on: ``Well, is it like the woman behind the man?
Well, you know, actually, I've learned a lot about some of those
issues because a vice president who does the job correctly is
somebody who pitches in and does everything that can help out the
country by strengthening the team and moving the ball down the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sarpolus, a longtime political analyst in Lansing who
conducted The Free Press polls, said that despite Bush's lead
across the state, Gore still leads heavily in this region. But he
added that Redman had given voice to the central obstacle that Gore
had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's problem in Michigan is not the China issue, it's not
the labor issue,'' he said of some union concerns. ``It's
personality and character because it's tied to Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When I look at people's angst with Gore, it's not
the policies'' that give them pause, but Clinton's ``moral
turpitude,'' he said. ``They will punish Bill through Al. And until
Gore separates himself from Clinton, it's the sins of the father
being visited on the son.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarpolus said that Gore needed eventually to make a clean break
with Clinton, probably after the convention, even though he was
relying on the Clinton economy as his biggest selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems more comfortable training the national discussion on
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put your finger on the problem,'' he told a man in a tank
top who implored the vice president to ``get more manufacturing
jobs back into Michigan.'' But even that man, a union worker who
said he earned $23,000 a year, shared a more personal reaction to
the vice president as he addressed him. ``You look a lot like my
older brother,'' he told Gore, approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore strategy at this point is to create the chance for the
vice president to make these personal connections, which he
invariably comes away from successfully, but also to hammer away at
his differences with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said that Gore would not
be distracted by Nader, whose name Gore never uttered during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sarpolus said that Gore's reference to being ``the woman behind
the man'' was probably a useful way to convey his role and his
sensibilities to women, who make up the majority of Democratic
voters _ even if it did not appeal to male voters, who polls show
favor Bush over the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't change the way he communicates that,'' Sarpolus
said. ``He has to reach women, and this helps him do that, by being
a man who is willing to admit that,'' he said. ``And if he doesn't
get the women's vote, it doesn't matter what happens with the
men.''

L.A.'S GROWTH TOPS STATE'S
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reflecting a still strong economy, unemployment
dipped slightly during June on an annual basis in Los Angeles
County while remaining flat across California, the state said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the jobless rate fell to 5.4 percent from 5.8 percent
in June 1999, said the California Employment Development
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Business services and the entertainment industry remained
especially strong, adding 15,800 and 10,000 jobs, respectively,
over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   On a monthly basis, business services added 5,000 jobs, and the
motion picture industry grew by 1,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it still looks real strong. There is no sign of
weakness,'' state labor market analyst Bill Freed said of the
county's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same picture emerged statewide as the jobless late last
month was 5.2 percent, unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   California businesses added 51,500 jobs from May to June, almost
25 percent of the nation's growth for the period.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially impressive considering that California's labor
force is growing three times faster than the nation's, said Ted
Gibson, chief economist for the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last month the number of people working or looking
for jobs increased by 78,000 from May to June. Of those, 54,000
found jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is doing very well,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   During June, business services like software development and
Internet-related jobs, as well as the entertainment industry, drove
the job growth.

RACERS LOOK TO SCORE IN L.A. MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Farmer calls this weekend's L.A. Street Race
the biggest event of the year for his NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Series team.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's Palmdale-based REF Motorsports is competing in the
heart of Los Angeles, which offers the Southwest Series its largest
market in a 19-race schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The media coverage, both print and broadcast, that Farmer's team
will receive over the next two days is unrivaled compared to other
stops on the tour. Sunday's 125-mile race at Exposition Park will
be televised live by Channel 4 at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exposure we're going to get and being on TV is just
fantastic for us,'' said Farmer, whose Southwest Tenant Development
Pontiac Grand Prix is driven by Saugus' Sean Woodside.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Series doesn't have the sponsorship clout of
NASCAR's higher-profile divisions such as the Busch and Craftsman
Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it helps a lot of the teams attract sponsors for
upcoming races,'' Farmer said. ``Most of the teams are low budget
(with) volunteers. There's only a couple teams out here that really
have big, corporate sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver MK Kanke, fifth in Southwest Series points, isn't one of
the lucky ones with a lucrative sponsorship deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the race) is pretty much important for the whole
series,'' said Kanke, who lives in Frazier Park. ``It kind of
recognizes what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Street Race is also a big deal to the drivers and teams
due to the event's oddity of a road course laid out on the streets
of a major city. It's the only such race among over 2,400
sanctioned by NASCAR each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Series has one traditional road course - Sears
Point in Sonoma - on its schedule. But this one-mile track with a
series of s-shaped curves poses a difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally different (from Sears Point). It's a lot
narrower. A little bit slower,'' Kanke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are a lot of transitions to different track
surfaces. That's the hardest part. You come off the concrete, you
go onto to the parking lot, then you go out into the street. The
car handles different on the concrete. It handles different on the
parking lot. And different on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Also racing this weekend are the Ultra WheelSpec
Trucks, the North-South Road Course Trucks, the Vintage Cobras and
the Pro Racing Series. ... Keep an eye on Newhall's Greg Pursley in
today's NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series qualifying run. He's
sat on the pole in this race the last two years. Pursley was just
the 23rd fastest in Friday's practice session. But many of the
drivers stayed conservative while describing the track as
``slick.''
