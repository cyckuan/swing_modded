<HEADLINE> Blair Says Britain Prepared to Use Force on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday that Britain was prepared to use force on Kosovo
although it still hoped for a peaceful solution to the worsening
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in British parliament, Blair made it clear that his
country would not hesitate to use force to defuse the current
crisis if diplomatic efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
"We hope over the next few days there will be the right mixture
of political and diplomatic initiatives. We are prepared to use
force if the political and diplomatic efforts fail," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
On whether NATO military action should need U.N. Security
Council agreement, Blair said: "We will of course make sure that
we have a proper legal basis."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR Anniversary Celebrated in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Economic and Trade
Office in Singapore held a grand cocktail reception here Wednesday
to mark the 1st anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception which was attended by more than 1,000
guests including Chinese Ambassador to Singapore Chen Baoliu,
Director of the office Thomas Tso said: "there are still vivid
memories about the historical moment when Hong Kong returned to
the motherland."
</P>
<P>
From then, "Hong Kong entered into a new era eagerly
anticipating the challenges and opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Hong Kong, Thomas Tso said: "The guiding
principle of 'one country, two systems' has been put into
practice. The rule of law is well preserved and a level playing
field is zealously maintained. The lifestyle of Hong Kong people
remains intact and the community is open, tolerant and vibrant as
ever."
</P>
<P>
While noting that Hong Kong In the past 12 months had
"encountered many challenges, perhaps a few more than we have
bargained for," he added: "We must not lose sight of the seamless
transition we have experienced."
</P>
<P>
Citing the financial turmoil in Asia and its knock-on effects
on Hong Kong, the director said Hong Kong is undergoing a period
of major economic adjustment and is sure to maintain and further
improve its competitive edge in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that Hong Kong has the strength to ride out
the storm and emerge stronger," Thomas Tso emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong will continue the efforts to maintain the
stability of the Hong Kong dollar through its pegged rate with the
U.S. dollar, and will, as a major international business and
financial center, carry on its role in facilitating trade and
investment flow in the region.
</P>
<P>
"With the will, ability and determination to press ahead with
our vision and close cooperation with our partners in Asia," he
said, "we in Hong Kong believe that the whole of Asia will soon be
able to be back on our feet."
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, difficult times may still be with us for a
while," but "we certainly are looking forward to a brighter future
in the next millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, a video presentation by SAR Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa on the occasion was shown.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Cola Taps New Sweetener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Pepsi-Cola will launch a diet cola
called Pepsi One this fall, sweetened with a new artificial
sweetener, the USA Today reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sweetener, called Sunett, is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
It is known chemically as acesulfame-K, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government already allows it in food products from
sugarless chewing gum to instant puddings. The new action puts
Sunett in the booming diet drink market, opening it to millions
more consumers.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer Nutrinova says Sunett will revolutionize diet
colas. Mixing Sunett with its leading competitor, distinctly,
makes drinks sugar more sugar-like, without that diet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
The mix is sweet enough that drink makers can cut the amount of
sweeteners they need to use by up to 40 percent, thus cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
Sunett is already in 70 percent of diet colas sold in Canada.
Pepsi also said that a diet cola won't compromise taste. About
two-thirds of consumers who tasted the new cola said they would
buy it.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A record-breaking 26 million Britain
audience watched England crash out of the World Cup in a penalty
shoot-out against Argentina, broadcasters said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An average 23.7 million fans tuned in to Tuesday night's match
on Britain's commercial ITV network, the highest since the
channel was established in 1955. The audience share was 80
percent, ITV said.
</P>
<P>
The number of viewers rose to 26 million - the highest number
for a single channel - at the start of the heart-breaking
shoot-out which Argentina won 4-3 to book a place in the
quarter-final of the tournament in France.
</P>
<P>
Only two other shows have ever commanded a higher audience on
British television - the Christmas 1996 edition of the BBC sitcom
Only Fools And Horses with 24.3 million and a November 1979
broadcast To The Manor Born on BBC with 23.9 million when ITV
programes were blacked out by a strike.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Takes Steep Drop in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. construction spending
fell 1.5 percent in May, the first drop in six months and the
largest in more than four years, the Commerce Department reported
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 633.5
billion U.S. dollars followed five consecutive gains, according to
the department. It was the sharpest drop since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Until May, construction spending had been supported by low U.S.
interest rates, produced as a side effect of Asia's financial
crises, and also by fierce competition among banks eager to
finance real estate development.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in May was led by government construction, which
declined 4 percent to an annual rate of 140.2 billion dollars.
Spending increased slightly on hospitals and held steady for
schools. But it fell for highways and streets, sewer systems,
water-supply facilities and other public buildings such as
offices, prisons, police and fire stations and courthouses.
</P>
<P>
The construction spending also fell for commercial projects,
down 1.7 percent to an annual rate of 165.3 billion dollars.
Declines in spending on factories, offices and hotels offset an
increase at shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction dipped 0.7 percent to an annual rate
of 286.6 billion dollars. Remodeling spending increased slightly,
but spending fell on construction of single-family homes and
apartments.

JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Three major opposition parties in

general elections in May, Southern African Broadcasting Association
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In their legal action, the Basotho Congress Party, the Basotho

<HEADLINE> Heat wave Hits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A heat wave is on Wednesday hitting
Greece with temperatures in many parts of the country soaring to
39 degrees and state services are remaining on alert to deal with
any problems stemming from the hot weather.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Athens, emergency calls for ambulances on
Wednesday increased 20 percent compared to Tuesday, and most of
the calls requested assistance for people suffering from heart and
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Athens, with the mercury hitting 37 degrees, came
to a standstill for several hours from power cuts reportedly
caused by high electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave, which began several days ago and will last four
days with temperatures to rise to 42 degrees at the weekend, has
been caused by an inflow of hot air from northern Africa and
special atmospheric conditions over Greece which have forced the
hot air down, the National Meteorological Service (EMY) warned.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperature was recorded on July 10, 1977, with
thermometers hitting 48 degrees centigrade in Athens, and the
longest heat wave lasted from July 19 to July 27, 1987, leading to
the deaths of hundreds of people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Discusses 2000 Computer Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa Wednesday said a co-ordinated approach is needed to
resolve the problem which will be caused by computers by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 problem has to be approached as a major project
within any organization," the minister told a Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe workshop organized to address the problem, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Both from the finance and manpower point of view, the problem
is enormous for individual organizations to tackle on their own.
A unified approach is the only way forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 posed a major challenge for financial
institutions, government departments and business organizations
as many automated applications would cease to function normally
because of the way date fields had been handled in the past, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Early computer programs stored the last digits of the year as
they tried to minimize the amount of storage and the cost of
memory.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, computers would treat the year
2000 as 1900, resulting in ambiguity and miscalculations. This
might cause many computer applications to behave unpredictably or
fail completely.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said failure to address this issue in time would
result in operational problems or bankruptcy, and could disrupt
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"We must take the necessary steps to ensure such problems are
minimized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide estimates for solving the problem were being put at
between 300 billion and 600 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Reserve Bank, Leonard Tsumba, told the workshop
that the Central Bank, in conjunction with the Bankers
Association, had embarked on a comprehensive awareness campaign
to ensure all business organizations and the government would take
appropriate measures to upgrade their computer systems to become
compliant.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank had started working with the Swiss-based Bank for
International Settlements to ensure global information network
would not fail after December 1999, Tsumba said.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Assembly Holds First Meeting in Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The 108 newly-elected members of the
Northern Ireland Assembly held their inaugural meeting on
Wednesday in Belfast, marking a milestone in the long peace
process in the province.
</P>
<P>
Lord John Alderdice, the government-appointed assembly speaker,
chaired the first meeting. The assembly is one of the main
building blocks of a historic peace deal aimed at ending 30 years
of bloody conflict in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time many arch rivals gathered in the same
room to discuss the management of Northern Irish affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the assembly's agenda will be the election of a first
minister. David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, the main
party representing Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant
majority and the largest group in the new forum, is likely to take
the post.
</P>
<P>
The first minister will head a 12-member executive with full
legislative and executive authority in education, agriculture,
economic development, environment, finance, health and social
security.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, which gives Northern Ireland its first measure of
home-rule since 1974, will also be charged with forging closer
relations with the neighbouring Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting is overshadowed by the coming parade of the
Protestants this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant marchers have been barred by the authority from
a Roman Catholic enclave in Drumcree, close to the strongly
pro-British town of Portadown. But they vowed on Monday to
continue their marches as planned.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Expresses Concern over Angolan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has expressed its
concern over the worsening security situation in Angola, Southern
African Broadcasting Association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Defense Minister Erikki Nghimtina was quoted as
saying that his country was worried about the weekend clashes
between the government forces and the military of the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which can develop
into a full scale military conflict.
</P>
<P>
He urged Namibians in the Caprivi and Okavango region,
bordering with Angola, to refrain from crossing into their
northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The situation was tense in the area controlled by UNITA, a
former rebel movement which is now Angola's main opposition, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to both the Angolan government and UNITA to
refrain from military action and find a peaceful solution under
the 1994 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi signed a peace accord in Lusaka four years ago to end 20
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
But the pact has been subjected to abuses, largely blamed on
UNITA, forcing the Security Council of the United Nations to
impose sanctions against the Angolan opposition party.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Unveil New Trade Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is preparing a new
trade package embracing the whole of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region, the Zimbabwe News Agency
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Trade Counsellor in Zimbabwe, Hennie Erasmus
said Pretoria's blueprint is expected to be unveiled in soon.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will classify all products into three
categories," Erasmus has told the latest issue of Commerce
Magazine published in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"The first will include all products attracting an import duty
in South Africa of up to 15 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Products falling into this group will immediately go down to
zero for all SADC countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estimations are that this category constitutes about 60
percent of all tariff lines in customs schedules.
</P>
<P>
The second category to be phased out over five years will
include all products attracting an import duty of more than 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The third category will be products classified as sensitive
industries, including products in categories one and two.
</P>
<P>
Erasmus envisaged the third category to include dairy, sugar,
flour, wheat and maize.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, Erasmus said, South Africa is
willing to open its market because imports from the region are
less than two percent of its total imports.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade talks with Zimbabwe had produced problems
for South Africa within its own business and labor sectors.
</P>
<P>
It was thought that Zimbabwe's requests for a bilateral trade
package could be better accommodated in multi-lateral talks under
SADC.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Accords Priority to Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- King Birendra of Nepal said
Wednesday that human resource development and poverty eradication
by attaining a high rate of economic growth will constitute the
foremost objective of the government.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the government's annual policies and programs to
parliament for the 1998/99 fiscal year beginning in mid-July, the
king said the programs of the Rural Development Bank, Women's
Micro Credit, Rural Self-help Fund and other poverty alleviation
programs will be carried out in a coordinated way in order to
implement the program of "Development in Each Village: Employment
in Each Family."
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of Nepal's 21.6 million population live below
the poverty line and the majority of them live in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take appropriate steps for the
increased access of the bank credits to the poor and destitute
communities, Birendra said.
</P>
<P>
The Local Infrastructure and Agro Road Department will be set
up in the Ministry of Local Development for the integrated
development of local infrastructures and for effective
implementation of agro roads.
</P>
<P>
And the programs aimed at improving the living conditions of
the impoverished women, the ignored, exploited, ethnic and
aboriginal people and those living in the remote areas of the
country will be continued and further expanded, the king said.
</P>
<P>
He said programs will be launched for the settlement of some
100,000 bonded laborers in a systematic way and soft loans and
employment opportunities will be provided to them.
</P>
<P>
"My government has set a target to complete the debt relief
works for bonded laborers within two years," he told the MPs.
</P>
<P>
"Also within the coming fiscal year, settlement of actual
landless people will be completed in a systematic manner on their
verification," he added.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra said that in view of the interrelationship
between poverty and health, essential health services will be made
accessible to all and effective steps will be taken for the
treatment of emerging transmissible and epidemic diseases
resulting from growing urbanization.
</P>
<P>
For human resource development, he said the government will
launch programs to enhance the rights of women in political,
economic, social and legal fields through gender equality and
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
"Women and girls trafficking will be stringently controlled
with the cooperation of non-governmental organizations and the
programs for their rehabilitation will be carried out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pre-primary and compulsory primary educational opportunities
will be expanded by mobilizing people's participation, and
continuity will be given to programs for additional educational
opportunities for female, destitute and deprived communities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that special arrangements will be made with priority
on the increased participation of the ethnic, aboriginal and
exploited communities in technical education in such areas as
engineering, medicine, forestry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
On economic development, the king said the government is
committed to alleviating the present economic slowdown by
increasing capital formation, production, productivity and
employment opportunities through the promotion of private
investment.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop comprehensively the country's huge water
resources, the government will introduce timely reform in the
present policy, rules and regulations so as to attract foreign and
domestic investors for its development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against such economic crimes as tax leakage and
smuggling initiated by the government will be intensified while
present reform and the monitoring system of revenue investigation
will be made more effective.
</P>
<P>
He said necessary arrangement will be made to introduce "One
Window System" in the tax administration by bringing coordination
among the various agencies dealing with value added tax (VAT) and
other taxes. He added that the VAT will be fully implemented from
the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government formally introduced the VAT in November
1997 despite strong opposition from the business community.
</P>
<P>
Birendra said available resources, technologies and credit
services will be mobilized to promote small businesses and micro
enterprises as viable means for employment generation.
</P>
<P>
He said that while according priority to the programs of the
20-year Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP), the government will
launch agricultural development programs by incorporating
irrigation, technology, credit, chemical fertilizers, road and
electrification.
</P>
<P>
The APP was introduced last year with the objective of
attaining a high growth rate and contributing to poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
To promote tourism and for the management of tourism
infrastructure in the country, the Nepal Tourism Promotion Board
will be made operational in the coming fiscal year, and airports
will be developed and upgraded separately in Bhairawa of western
Nepal and Biratnagar in eastern Nepal for regional and
international flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Air service agreements will be reached with more and more
countries so as to make Nepal easily accessible to tourists, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the Visit Nepal Year '98 was launched in
January, Nepal signed air accords with a dozen countries and
regions.

<HEADLINE> UK Electricity Regulator Encourages Power Sell-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Electricity Regulation
(OFFER) has stepped up pressure on generating companies in Britain
to sell off some of their power stations, aiming to allow new
companies to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
Since the electricity industry in Britain was privatized in
1990, the supply side of the market has been dominated by only a
handful of generating companies.
</P>
<P>
National Power and PowerGen, Britain's two largest fossil fuel
electricity generators, must sell some of their coal-fired power
stations to reduce their "unacceptable" market power, OFFER said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Littlechild, director general of OFFER, said generators
last Winter had increased system marginal prices by 30 percent.
This could not be justified by a rise in demand or reduction in
capacity.
</P>
<P>
OFFER said that under the present arrangements, electricity
generated using coal is not as cheap as it could be were there
more players in the market.
</P>
<P>
The generators' strategy appeared to be to make a profitable
withdrawal from coal-fired generation "at the expense of customers
and also at the expense of coal as a fuel for electricity
generation," Littlechild said.
</P>
<P>
The government last week said it wanted to see power station
disposals by the large generators as part of broad-ranging reforms
to make the electricity sector more competitive.

FRANKFURT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Frankfurt Stock Exchange

The new floor-trading session of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
now runs from 8:30 to 17:00 instead of from 10:30 to 13:30.
</P>

trading system called Xetra as well as from regional stock

ATHENS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About 15 acres of farm and bush land

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen percent of French people
openly declare themselves as xenophobes, and 40 percent say they
are drawn by racist feeling from time to time, according to a poll
published Wednesday by the daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the National Consultative Commission
of Human Rights from November 24 to December 6 of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This figure puts France, along with Belgium, on top of European
countries in terms of number of people who declare themselves as
being more or less racist.
</P>
<P>
The poll also shows that a majority of those polled have
sympathy for the san papiers immigrants seeking legal residency in
France.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that young people, people with a high
educational level, and people with higher incomes hold a more
positive and friendly feeling towards foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said that although racism continues to haunt France, a
majority of French people are committed to the traditional value
of the country to play host to foreigners.

<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Seed funding for the UK universities
to help turn research into successful business is now available

</P>
<P>

need a more vibrant entrepreneurial culture in our academic life
and a more scientifically streetwise business community if we are
to create powerful synergy between science and industry."
</P>
<P>
The Fund is regarded as a key step in helping to unleash
entrepreneurial spirit in the academic world and bringing science

<HEADLINE> Sanctions on Angola's UNITA Go into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A new set of sanctions on
Angola's opposition UNITA, or the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, went into force as of midnight June 30, a
U.N. Security Council presidential statement said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The council took the measures as UNITA "has not taken the
advantage" of the council's latest resolution which allows UNITA
to finally complete its peace obligations, said this month's
council president, Russia's Sergey V. Lavrov.
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a resolution on June 12 to impose sanctions
on UNITA that include freezing UNITA's bank accounts and outlawing
its diamond trade. The movement failed to comply with the
council's demand and the council on June 24 gave it a grace period
until June 30.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA has not demilitalrized itself and transferred the four
strategic areas under its control to state administration as
requested by the 1994 Lusaka Protocol and relevant U.N.
resolutions, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 15 council members call on U.N. member states to
fully implement the sanction measures and reiterate their demand
to UNITA to complete its obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accords ended two decades of civil war after
Angola won its independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The council imposed air and travel curbs on Senior UNITA
officials and closed UNITA overseas offices last year.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Starts Taking Over Defense of Its Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Georgian border troops on Wednesday
started to take over the defense of the former Soviet republic's
maritime border, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Georgian ships will take control of the border starting July 16
in accordance with an agreement initialled with Russia in Moscow
on June 27, Interfax quoted a Georgian parliamentary official as
saying in Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russian border guards will gradually
transfer defense of all sections of the Georgian border to their
Georgian counterparts, said Revaz Adamiya, chairman of the
Committee for Defense and National Security of the Georgian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, Georgian border guards will take over the
defense of its maritime border along the coasts of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
During the second stage, Georgian border troops will take over
defense of its land borders with Turkey, Adamiya said.
</P>
<P>
He said Georgia, with necessary ships, personnel and coast
patrols, is ready to deal with the new task.
</P>
<P>
The United States provided Tbilisi 20 million U.S. dollars for
this purpose this year alone, and more such assistance is coming,
Adamiya said.
</P>
<P>
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia retained its
military bases and troops in Gerogia. Tbilisi also agreed that
Russian troops patrol its borders with Turkey and along the
coastal borders of the Black Sea, while Georgian troops are in
charge of defense of other sections of its borders.

HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian-born traditional healer
Francis Ng'ombe is planning a world conference of traditional
healers to promote the use of traditional medicines and cures.
</P>
<P>
Ng'ombe, who is president of the All Africa and Asia Medicine
Men Association, told a news conference in Harare Wednesday, "If
we do not recognize our own medicine then it will be considered
primitive, irrelevant and or witchcraft."
</P>
<P>
Ng'ombe is on a tour of southern Africa to promote the value
of traditional medicine and meet Zimbabwe's National Associations
of Traditional Healers, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Ng'ombe said African leaders were hypocritical and
did not want to come out in the open in support of traditional
medicines.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is need to explore the capabilities of
traditional medicine more by creating a center for excellence in
traditional healing.
</P>
<P>
He plans to establish a multi-million dollar modern research
center that will cater for in-depth researches in herbal and
conventional medicines.
</P>
<P>
The research center would be like a university, researching
and transforming traditional medicines into scientific medicines
sold worldwide, Ng'ombe said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Clarifies Stand on Europe's Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- In another attempt to dispel
Europe's concerns and worries towards Iran, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami Wednesday clarified his country's policies,
saying they serve to remove tensions.
</P>
<P>
"We feel no enmity towards any party or country," Khatami said
in a meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we expect others to respect our national
interests and the principles of friendship in their relations with
Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Iran attaches great importance to human
rights, adding that peace and human rights will be realized only
when all human beings enjoy suitable living rights.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of weapons of mass destruction, Khatami
said that "Iran favors a region free from weapons of mass
destruction, including the nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
He called for a non-discriminatory approach to the issue of
nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was apparently responding to European Union's concerns
over Iran's alleged human rights abuses, attempts to undermine the
Middle East peace process and seek weapons of mass destruction,
and support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The EU has announced its readiness to hold dialog with Iran
over the concerns in a bid to establish a new bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Italian prime minister, which started Tuesday,
is believed to help find ways to improve the EU-Iran relations
which were cooled down in Europe's various accusations against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed Italy as the cradle of the western civilization,
saying that a unique and friendly relation between Iran, which he
said is the cradle of the Islamic civilization. He called on Italy
to help realize the much promoted dialog amongst civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that "we are of the belief that no problem in the
region can be solved without Iran's active participation."
</P>
<P>
"Peace and tranquillity in the Middle East can be brought
about only through participation of the important countries of
the region, including Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that dialog among civilizations will
bring about understanding among nations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cultural exchanges can help Iran and Italy forge
closer ties in the international arena, Prodi said the formation
of Rome-Tehran joint commission next month will promote the
expansion of their cooperation in trade and industries.
</P>
<P>
Prodi received an honorary doctorate from Tehran University
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Alliance Remains Important: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday attached great importance to the ruling
African National Congress (ANC)'s alliance with the South African
Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade
Unions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the SACP's 10th congress here, Mandela said the
congress came at a critical time -- as the alliance was being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
"It comes when the assault on our alliance has reached an all
time high. It comes at a time when opposition forces are
attacking our very existence."
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said, the role of the alliance was as
important as ever in continuing on the path of reconstruction and
development to better the lives of the poorest South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The SACP, established in 1921, had been working hand in hand
with the ANC in fight against apartheid for more than half a
century. It has become a member of the ruling alliance since
apartheid was abolished in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The SACP congress also came at a time when a vision of and for
the poor in the new millennium needed to be programmatically
defined, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was also presented the Chris Hani Award for Peace by
the SACP at the congress.
</P>
<P>
Hani, former leader of the SACP, was assassinated by apartheid
extremists on April 10, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The five-day SACP congress will review progress made in the
country since the first non-racial elections in 1994 in addition
to assessment of the party's performance since its last congress
in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will also elect a ne w central committee of the
party and its leaders.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Wednesday called on
the international community to put pressure on Eritrea to
withdraw its troops from the Ethiopian territory.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has the responsibility of
continuing to put pressure on the Eritrean regime to withdraw its
troops from Ethiopian territory on the basis of the proposal made
by the facilitators and endorsed by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) as well as now supported by the (United Nations)
Security Council," said a news release issued by the Ethiopian
Foreign Ministry.

"The ball is in Eritrea's court," the ministry said, adding
that "Ethiopia has accepted this resolution by the Security
Council in its entirety, without picking and choosing and with no

<HEADLINE> UN Compensation Commission Approves First Corporate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Compensation
Commission (UNCC) approved here Wednesday first corporate claims
to award four companies a total of 187.5 million U.S. dollars for
their losses in Iraq following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The four foreign construction companies originally sought an
amount of up to two billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the end of its three-day meeting, the UNCC Governing Council
ruled that companies which were not paid by Iraq can only be
helped from a Gulf War compensation fund if the claims are for
goods or services delivered within three months of the start of
the war.
</P>
<P>
The decision to rule out claims for earlier contracts will act
as a guideline for deciding on scores of further claims by foreign
businesses which worked in Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait on
August 2, 1990, a senior official of the governing council said.
</P>
<P>
"They studied the practice of payment in Iraq, they looked at
how the payment system worked, they didn't want to choose an
arbitrary (cut-off) date," said Mojtaba Kazazi, secretary of the
commission's Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kazazi said the commission decided to grant only
187.5 million dollars out of two billion dollars sought by the
four companies. The commission's decision is final and cannot be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
The companies were named as Continental Construction Ltd of
India, Kuwait's Gulf Cable and Electrical Co, Hyundai Construction
of South Korea and Technopromexport of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC was established in accordance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions 687 and 692 (1991) to pay compensation for
losses and damages suffered by individuals, corporations,
governments and international organizations as a direct result of
Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Funds to pay compensation are drawn from the Compensation Fund,
also established under Security Council resolution 692.
</P>
<P>
The fund receives up to 30 percent of the revenue from the
export of Iraqi oil under the "oil-for-food" mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Warns Against Attempt to Harm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
Wednesday warned his countrymen against any attempt to harm
national unity, after riots shook the region of Kabyla last week
following the assassination of singer Matoub Lounes.
</P>
<P>
"Barbarian terrorism and those who carry hatred toward Algeria
try to bring harm to the unity of the country and the stability of
the country by sowing disagreement among our people and by trying
to hijack them on the way of democracy and progress," the official
Algerian news service quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is determined to "face up with the
strictness of the law to all attempts whose objective is to harm
the achievements of the Algerian people."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militant group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), has
claimed responsibility for the assassination of Lounes, 43, who
was considered the symbol of the Berber culture and was hated by
Islamists for his stand against Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual recognized that the economic and social situation in
Algeria remains difficult, with a "heavy burden of unemployment"
estimated at 28 percent among the young people.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed last weekend in the riots of the
Kabyla region, a mountainous area east of the capital Algiers.

BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy is in favor of larger
autonomy for Kosovo, said on Wednesday Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini, who is on an one-day official visit to Romania.
</P>
<P>
"We need to determine countries directly concerned, Yugoslavia
on the one hand and Kosovo and Albania on the other, to accept the
idea that Kosovo's strong autonomy could solve the crisis in
Kosovo", Dini said at a press conference after official talks with
his Romanian counterpart Andrei Plesuo.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts will be devoted to bring the concerned
parties to the negotiating table, he said, adding that "Everybody
should understand that persisting with the idea of independence
for the province of Kosovo could trigger an army conflict, a war
that could spread out over the whole region."

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Pursue Diplomacy to Solve S.Asia Nuclear Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States, while
imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests,
would continue to pursue "discreet" diplomacy to dissuade them
from further developing nuclear programs, U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press breakfast, Talbott said diplomacy "is
already under way," and he indicated to intensify and accelerate
the pace so that it would "ultimately produce some results
during the months ahead."
</P>
<P>
But he said the diplomacy "needs to have an element of
cooperation" with both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the U.S. strategy was to seek to persuade India
and Pakistan that it was in their own interests to refrain from
building nuclear weapons or producing fissile material.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that India and Pakistan will both be safer, they
will be better off, if they were to apply after the fact of
these tests the kind of restraint and discipline and
forward-looking wisdom that we wish they had applied before they
made the mistake of the tests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said in the coming months, U.S. officials will discuss
world's concern over the nuclear tests with both governments
"through discreet but not by any means secret channel."
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Talbott has met both Indian special envoy
Jaswant Singh and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed to
discuss the nuclear issue, and he said he expected more such
meetings in the future.

<HEADLINE> New Israeli-Lebanese Swap Depends on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) said Wednesday that a new swap deal between
Lebanon and Israel depends on the information of a missing Israeli
pilot.
</P>
<P>
Any information about Israel's air force navigator Ron Arad
will help the two countries strike another deal, under which
Lebanese prisoners held by Israel may be freed, Jean Jacques
Fresard, ICRC's chief delegate, told reporters after a meeting
with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Arad's plane was shot down by Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon in 1986. He was believed to be captured alive by the
guerrillas, but no clear information has been provided on his
whereabouts ever since.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims that the Hezbollah (Party of God) is keeping Arad
in its prison or his body if he is dead. But the anti-Israel
Muslim group has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Fresard called on any groups or individuals having relevant
information about the pilot to contact with the ICRC or the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
He said that his organization is ready to play a role in
brokering a possible new swap deal.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has recently achieved a deal between the two sides,
under which Israel last Wednesday returned to Lebanon the bodies
of 40 guerrillas and freed 60 prisoners in exchange for the
remains of a soldier killed last September in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 117 more Lebanese are still held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
 south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas
from cross-border guerrilla attacks, Lebanese resistance forces
have been fighting to oust the Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Top Political Detainee May Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's prominent political
detainee, Chief Moshood Abiola, may be freed soon after four
years of life in prison, according to sources in the capital
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Wednesday Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi has
suggested that an agreement could soon be reached to allow the
release of Abiola, who was widely believed to have won the
annulled June 12, 1993 presidential polls of the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Abiola is in prison for what Ikimi called the treason offense
of declaring himself president.
</P>
<P>
However, Ikimi said that time has come for reconciliation and
he would not be surprised that all sides reach an agreement for
the best interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi's comments came as secretaries-general of the United
Nations and the Commonwealth, Kofi Annan and Chief Emeka Anyaoku
are in Nigeria on separate mediation missions.
</P>
<P>
The two envoys, who have met with the country's new leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, reportedly had separate meetings
with Abiola Tuesday evening in an unnamed place.
</P>
<P>
The results of the meetings are not available at the moment
but are expected to be known Thursday when the two envoys are
expected to give separate press conferences in Abuja and Lagos
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has become focus of attention of the international
community since the sudden death of former military ruler General
Sani Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Western countries are determined to seize the change of leader
as an opportunity to bring Nigeria back to the world of
democracy, according to political watchers here.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Mideast Nuclear-Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei Wednesday called for declaring the Middle East a nuclear
free zone in order to contain Israel's nuclear capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
here, Khamenei said that Israel is stockpiling nuclear weapons
and has turned into an arsenal of the U.S. weapons as Washington
continuously helps it acquire more nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted the Iranian leader as
saying the world should get tough with Israel and the European
Union (EU) and other influential countries should be more active
in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Turning to relations between Christianity and Islam, Khamenei
said, "I would like to commit myself and declare that the Muslim
world shall never confront the Christians at any time and that
mutual understanding between Islam and Christianity shall grow
still firmer."
</P>
<P>
About Tehran-Rome ties, Khamenei said that the positive trend
of growth of relations between Italy and Iran is based upon
issues of mutual interest, traditional relations, current
potentialities and capabilities of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who arrived here Tuesday night for a two-day official
visit, said his meetings with Iranian officials have been very
fruitful, adding that Italy is willing to broaden relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Rome's concern about arms race in the Middle
East.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Liberia and Sierra
Leone, Charles Taylor and Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, arrived in the
Nigerian capital Abuja earlier Wednesday to discuss issues of
sub-regional security, according to sources from Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, the sources said, have met with United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Commonwealth
counterpart Chief Emeka Anyaoku, who are in Nigeria for
improvement in the relations between the west African country and
the international community, particularly the west.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meetings are not known. But the talks held are
supposed to be in connection with the west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG, which helped end Liberia's civil war last
year and restored Kabbah's ousted government earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Taylor has called on ECOMOG to leave his
country, while Kabbah hopes ECOMOG could complete its mopping up
exercise on remnants of the junta and allied rebels as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who heads a 30-man delegation, reportedly said before
leaving for Abuja that a mini-summit would be held among Annan,
Kabbha, Nigeria's head of state General Abdulsalam Abubakar and
himself for finding a lasting solution to the Sierra Leonean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Taylor stands accused of helping recalcitrant rebels elements
in Sierra Leone since the junta was toppled by ECOMOG in
mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean officials were also quoted as saying that
President Kabbah would be in Abuja for "high level security
talks".

<HEADLINE> Businessmen of Cyprus' Rival Communities Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek and Turkish Cypriot business
representatives have called for increased contact and cooperation
between the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a joint statement issued at the end
of a two-day meeting of business representatives of the two
Cypriot communities in Oslo, Norwegian capital, which was a
follow-up to a meeting in Brussels last November, Cyprus News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need for particular steps "to relax
and eventually lift all restrictions on the free movement of
people, goods and services and increase contacts in business,
cultural and sports areas."
</P>
<P>
"Such contacts should be encouraged by the political
authorities on both sides," the bicommunal business
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to work together toward realizing a number of
projects such as the restoration of the Apostolos Andreas
Monastery, in the Turkish-controlled northeastern Karpas
peninsula, and the Hala Sultan Mosque in the government-controlled
southern areas of the island.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include the enhancement of telecommunication
services, joint environmental efforts starting with a solid waste
disposal project and joint trade and economic ventures in areas
such as dairy products, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two communities' businessmen also propose "the holding of
a tournament of local sports clubs and cultural events, starting
with the sports tournament in November."
</P>
<P>
They called for the negotiation process between the two
communities to move forward and pledged to "work to persuade the
political leadership of both sides to support these initiatives."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
1974 in the aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has suspended the
bicommunal contacts since last December to protest against a
European Union decision to begin accession talks with the Cypriot
government in March this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government welcomed
Wednesday the statements by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill
Richardson, which urged Turkey to work to break the deadlock in
the Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the comments by Ambassador Bill
Richardson since they back the U.N. resolutions and the fresh
effort to break the current deadlock," government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said at his press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the Security Council, Richardson called on
Turkey to cooperate with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his
special advisor Diego Cordovez in their efforts to promote a
comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the U.S. support for U.N. efforts to achieve
a just and lasting settlement based on a bizonal and bicommunal
federation of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides noted that the statement reflected the unified
position of U.N. Security Council members and backed Cordovez's
new attempt to break the deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez is due to arrive here Thursday for talks with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process has been stalled since last summer
when Denktash quited the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with
Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, to protest against the
decision by the European Union (EU) to start accession
talks with the Clerides-led Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has demanded the recognition of his breakaway entity
in northern Cyprus and halt of the EU entry talks as precondition
for resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal and bicommunal federation through peace
talks, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Defend Spending on Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A private research group said
the U.S. is spending 35 billion U.S. dollars on nuclear weapons
annually even after the Cold War ended, while the State Department
defended nuclear programs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the weapons
deterred the Soviet Union and the fact that the program was
expensive "should not come as a surprise."
</P>
<P>
Since the birth of the atomic weapons program in 1940, a total
of 5.5 trillion U.S. dollars was spent through 1996, the private
research group reported.
</P>
<P>
The cost is 29 percent of all U.S. military spending and almost
11 percent of all government spending through the 52 years.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said administration officials had not had a chance to
assess the accuracy of the Brookings estimates.
</P>
<P>
But he added, "It was worth the expense; communism was worth
deterring through a combined policy of containment and
modernization of nuclear forces."
</P>
<P>
Stephen Schwartz, chief of the four-year study project, said
that the audit was not undertaken to determine whether the U.S.
nuclear force was worth the expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Calculating costs for nuclear research, development,
deployment, command and control, defenses and dismantlement, the
audit was designed to set the stage for "an honest and fully
informed debate to begin."
</P>
<P>
Schwartz wrote in the report that the "impetus to manufacture
and deploy large numbers of nuclear weapons gathered strength
because nuclear weapons were considered less expensive than
conventional strength."
</P>
<P>
Had the true costs been known, he wrote, there almost certainly
would have been a debate about the wisdom of the continued buildup
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The study found that only seven percent of the total cost for
the nuclear weapons went for development and manufacture of the
actual warheads.
</P>
<P>
Development of weapons system, such as bombers and missiles,
and the infrastructure to facilitate their use made up 86 percent
of the expenses, while much of the rest went for cleanup.
</P>
<P>
"In the end," Schwartz said, "cleanup costs may be as much as
the weapons cost in the first place."
</P>
<P>
The stockpile of the nuclear weapons has the equivalent
explosive force of about 120,000 Hiroshima bombs although new
weapons are no longer being produced, Shwartz said.
</P>
<P>
He added that 4.5 billion U.S. dollars were spent annually to
keep the nuclear stockpile reliable.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Spend $52M  for Helping Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
World Food Program (WFP) signed an agreement here Wednesday on
providing humanitarian assistance to the refugees in 1998/99 in
the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, WFP will provide the 539,500 war-created
refugees with humanitarian assistance worth 52 million U.S.
Dollars including 79,346 tons of foods during the year from March
1998 to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
WFP will also work with the Angolan government to facilitate
the rehabilitation of these refugees, encouraging them to return
home earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Angolan government will take
up some expenditures in helping the refugees, mainly providing
low-priced fuels to them. The cost in this area will amount to
six million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Angolan Minister of Assistance
and Social Reintegration Albino Malungo said that the
implementation of the agreement will offer relief to the urgent
demand of the refugees for foods and will help them return home
in time.
</P>
<P>
WFP is the major structure of the United Nations in providing
foods to the Angolan refugees. It gives help to Angolan people
in health care, such as fighting against malnutrition,
tuberculosis and some epidemics in the country. It also takes an
active part in helping the war orphans and the street children in
the southern African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Emerges Biggest Importer of Nigeria's Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite cold bilateral political
relations, the U.S. has replaced Western European as the biggest
importer of Nigeria's crude oil in 1997, the Central Bank of
Nigeria has said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its newly released 1997 annual report that
the U.S. bought 267 million barrels of crude oil from Nigeria
last year, which accounted for 34.6 percent of Nigeria's total
export.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 11 million barrels up from 1996 but 4.9 million
barrels down from the level of 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the share of Western Europe in Nigeria's total
crude oil export declined from 36.3 percent in 1996 to 27.6
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In all, Nigeria exported 213 million barrels of crude oil to
Western Europe in 1997, compared to 270.7 million barrels a year
before.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the upward trend in the share of Asia's
crude oil import from Nigeria which began in 1995 was sustained
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The region's share which stood at 11.5 percent in 1995 went up
to 16 percent in 1996, and rose further to 17.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Purchase of Nigeria's crude oil by African countries stood at
51.9 million barrels in 1997, accounting for a share of 5.7
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer and member of the
Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC), produces a
little more than two million barrels of crude oil a day.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Control on Soft PVC Toys for Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission urged
Wednesday European governments to check against baby toys made of
soft PVC that are blamed for releasing hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
European Union scientists claimed that two of the six chemical
additives in PVC could pose long-term health risks if sucked by
young children.
</P>
<P>
The additives are DINP and DEHP, both of the family of
phthalates. Animal tests showed that they are toxic and can cause
cancer when ingested.
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation EU, voted on June 10 against a total ban on phthalates,
arguing that it is hard to gauge the rate at which phthalates
migrate from PVC to human bodies.
</P>
<P>
European Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino, however,
recommended a ban on toys designed to be chewed or sucked.
</P>
<P>
Denmark and Spain have already withdrawn certain types of
teething rings from markets while Austria, that is taking over the
rotating presidency of the EU, notified the commission of its
intention to ban the use of all phthalates in toys that are to be
chewed or sucked.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Increase Power Generating Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran is boosting its power industry,
expecting to greatly increase electricity generating capacity for
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Iran's power generating capacity stands at 25,000 megawatts,
ranking the 21st largest producer of electricity in the world,
Iranian Deputy Energy Minister Mohammad Malaki said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's electric output is expected to reach 105 billion
kilowatts-hour this year, 9 billion kilowatts-hour more than that
last year, the official news agency IRNA quoted Malaki as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country should increase power generating
capacity by 1,600 to 2,000 megawatts annually in the next 10 years
to meet the needs for power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Minister of Energy Habibollah Bitaraf said
on Tuesday in Chaloos in northern Mazadaran Province that Iran's
energy consumption rises by an annual 8.9 percent every year, 3.9
percentage points more than the figure predicted in the second
five-year development plan from 1995 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaki, Iran exports 20 million U.S. dollars worth
of electricity to Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan each year and its
power network will be linked with that of Turkmenistan by the end
of the current Iranian year on March 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the country earns a yearly 25-30 million dollars from
exporting power equipment and products to Syria, Libya and
Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaki said that Iran is to host the 4th power industry fair on
July 6-10. Some 165 private and 55 public companies of Iran, and
companies from Russia, Britain and Syria are expected to take part
in the fair.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq to Discuss Building Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Energy and
Mineral Resources Saleh Hourani left here Wednesday for Iraq
to discuss building a pipeline in order to lower the cost of
Iraq's oil supply to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will talk about the continued implementation of
the deal signed in December 1997, in which Iraq agreed to provide
Jordan with 4.8 million tonnes of oil and oil products this year
at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve a more economic and quicker way of
transporting oil from Iraq, the two sides are exploring the
possibility of constructing a 750-kilometer-long pipeline between
the Iraqi city Haditha and a Jordanian oil refinery in Zarqa, some
20 kilometers northeast to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Iraqi oil supply is carried out by oil tankers,
at the rate of 400 trucks a day, costing Jordan 50 million
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The planned pipeline, estimated to cost some 250 million
dollars, is expected to save money for Jordan in a long-term view.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in Baghdad, Hourani will also discuss the
prospects for jointly developing oil fields near the
Jordanian-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been the sole oil provider for Jordan for years, and
it sells oil to Jordan at a pricer much lower than that on the
international market. In 1998, Iraqi oil is sold to the kingdom at
16.8 dollars per barrel, down from 19.15 dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Lisbon Conference to Address Youth Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A conference organized by
Portugal and the United Nations to deal with issues facing youth
will be held in Lisbon, Portugal, next month, it was announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 ministers in charge of youth affairs are expected
to gather to discuss unprecedented rural-to-urban migration,
unemployment, poverty, armed conflicts, juvenile violence and
sexual exploitation, the U.N. Department of Public Information
(DPI) said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Other issues on the agenda are opportunities for education,
training, health and social services.
</P>
<P>
John Langmore, an official with the U.N. Economic and Social
Affairs Department, said it is the fist global meeting on youth at
the ministerial level held since the founding of the U.N. in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The conference will decide on further ways of implementing the
World Program of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The program focuses in particular on measures to strengthen
national capacities regarding youth and to increase the quality
and quantity of opportunities available to young people.
</P>
<P>
The world youth population, defined by the U.N. as the age
group between 15 and 24 years old, was estimated in 1995 at 1
billion, or 18 percent of the total world population. Most of them
live in developing countries and their numbers are expected to
rise well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Due to be opened by Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on August 8, the conference will end
on August 12, the DPI said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Military Dismisses Rumor on Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's defense authorities
Wednesday opened up on the rumor surrounding the fate of former
Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya and other officers,
saying that their conditions are okay.
</P>
<P>
"Lt.-Gen. Diya and the others are hale and hearty where they
are kept," Rear Admiral Festus Porseni, defense chief of
administration, said at the Defense Headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Diya and five others were sentenced to death by a special
military tribunal last April for an alleged plot to overthrow the
late General Sani Abacha government.
</P>
<P>
The sentence has since been submitted to the country's highest
policy-making body, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), to
ratify.
</P>
<P>
There were reports earlier this week that the coup plotters
had been kidnapped or even executed not long after the sudden
death of Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the rumors, Porseni said "since the completion of
the tribunal, the PRC had not met to ratify the sentences of the
individual convicts," the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
He said such rumors at this time of national reconciliation
when the nation's doors were being opened to many outsiders were
uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
"Henceforth the spread of such rumors shall be visited by the
long arm of the law," he said, appealing that the seeming peace
in the country should be allowed to remain.
</P>
<P>
However, Porseni admitted that the movement of the coup
plotters from one place to another was normal and could be done
according to security implications.
</P>
<P>
There have been appeals for the release of Diya and others
involved in the coup plot since the death of Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Says Scoring Secondary Aim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian striker Ronaldo said his most
important aim at the World Cup finals here was not to become the top
scorer but to help Brazil successfully defend the title.
</P>
<P>
"To finish as top goal scorer is not the most important thing for
me. My real aim is for Brazil to finish up as world champions," he
said after Tuesday's training session.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo said, "That's the goal I have in front of me, and that's
the only thing I'm concerned about."
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo said he had a slight pain behind his left knee, which is
why he did not train Tuesday afternoon but this would influence the
qurterfinal match against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no overweight problems that could affect his
performance in the World Cup finals here.
</P>
<P>
"For the rumours about my possible weight problems, that was a
misunderstanding between the team doctor and the physical trainer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the same weight as I was in 1996 before the Olympic Games in
Atlanta -- 83.4 kilograms. It's my fighting weight, though it's true I
could lose a few grams," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will meet Denmark on Friday in Nantes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Syria Seek Ways to Normalize Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Syria are discussing ways
of normalizing their relations, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to open a way for dialog in relations frozen for
a long time," Turkish Foreign Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir told
reporters Wednesday after talks held here with his Syrian
counterpart Adnan Omran.
</P>
<P>
"This is a long and difficult process. The matters being taken
up are extremely sensitive," Haktanir said, adding that the
terrorism issue, which is a major obstacle to the normalization of
the ties, has been discussed in detail.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Haktanir and Omran discussed ways of
returning the troubled relations between the two neighbors to
normal, the semi-official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Omran, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day trip, is the
most senior Syrian official visiting Turkey in four years. He is
expected to meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are trying to set up concrete channels,
including arranging high-level visits, to solve their thorny
problems, Haktanir said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have long been at odds due to differences over
sharing of water resources and alleged Damascus' support for
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting
since 1984 for a Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey bordering
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Manufactures Cars in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to increase its share of
Egypt's booming car market, South Korean auto giant Daewoo
unveiled first two locally produced cars Wednesday night at a
ceremony held against the breathtaking backdrop of the Great
Pyramids.
</P>
<P>
The two cars, Lanos 1500 cc and Leganza 2000 cc, were
manufactured in Daewoo's first joint automobile factory built with
an Egyptian partner, the Aboul Fotouh Establishment, which is one
of Egypt's top five corporations.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, named Daewoo Motor Egypt S.A.E., is a
30,000-square-meter factory constructed on the fringe of the Sixth
of October City, about 26 kilometers east of the capital city
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo contributed 60 percent of the 45 million U.S. dollars of
total investment for building the factory, while the rest of the
came from its Egyptian partner.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-S.Korean partnership followed a couple of
similar marriages between local companies and world-famed auto
names, such as Germany's Daimles-Benz and Hyundai Co., South
Korea's No.1 automaker.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Wednesday, Chairman of the Aboul
Fotouh Establishment Houssam Aboul Fotouh expressed confidence
about the success of the joint venture in an increasingly
competitive market. He dismissed the concern about a saturated car
market in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many varieties of passenger cars competing
against each other in Egypt. But what we are viewing at is a niche
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the biggest car factories in Egypt, the factory takes
aim at Egypt's expanding middle class by producing low-price
economic and luxurious passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo's President and CEO Byung-Ho Kang explained that the two
cars are Daewoo's latest models in the category of economic and
luxurious cars with competitive prices. No prices were disclosed
for the local sales of the two models, bu they sell for 10,000
dollars and 25,000 dollars in Poland, the biggest overseas market
for Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
Kang predicted that the combined production of the two cars
would exceed 3,500 units by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He added that the joint venture will also import two other
models which are Nubira 1600 cc-16 valve and the smaller cozy
Matiz that has "fascinated the Koreans" since it first hit the
market at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The company is also planning to manufacture commercial vehicles
such as microbuses, pickups, trucks starting from next year.
</P>
<P>
H. I. Lee, managing director of Daewoo Motor Egypt, predicted
that the company will gain at least 15 percent share of the
Egyptian market within a year.
</P>
<P>
Kang said the new company was part of Daewoo's efforts to shift
its production overseas in the face of a declining domestic
market, which has shrunk by 50 percent within less than a year.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, which sold 1.3 million passenger cars worldwide in 1997
and earned 4 billion dollars in revenues, boasts a bigger overseas
market than its top domestic competitor Hyundai.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Convention Planners Postpone Philadelphia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Democrats looking for a site for
their national convention in 2000 left Philadelphia rather than
face pickets in an acrimonious transit strike.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Democratic National Committee's site-advisory
group withdrew hours after their arrival Tuesday afternoon for a
three-day visit, although they promised they'd be back to check
out the city once they wouldn't have to run the risk of crossing
picket lines.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, as Democrats, every single member of the committee
is a supporter of organized labor and believes in the principles
of organized labor," The Associated Press quoted Joe Andrew,
chairman of the group, as saying. "The committee's interest here
is making sure that Philadelphia has as good a shot at this thing
as any of the finalists."
</P>
<P>
The DNC committee is visiting six other candidates -- Boston,
Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and New Orleans -- for its
national convention, which amounts to a 150 million dollar
windfall for the winner.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia had three days of touring and selling planned:
visits to the Independence Hall and fancy restaurants, parades by
police cruisers, fire trucks and the Mummers and the pitch itself.
</P>
<P>
But the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) and
the Transport Workers Union Local 234 were in negotiations Tuesday
when talks suddenly went sour and union local president Steve
Brookens stormed out of the negotiations. Some 200 workers marched
down Market Street to set up pickets near the Independence Hall,
where the DNC group were to arrive for a tour at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edward G. Rendell said the committee had already decided
to leave town.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them to have to decide who's right and who's
wrong," said Rendell.
</P>
<P>
The strike started on June 1 during the Republican
site-selection committee visit, but the SEPTA strikers did not
picket the Republicans.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
asked African nations not to accept an invitation from Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi to attend a ceremony next week honoring
the birthday of the prophet Mohammed.

Gadhafi sent out invitations to Muslim leaders throughout
Africa for the July 6 event. The invitations were issued after
the Organization of African Unity expressed disapproval of the
travel ban at its summit meeting in Burkina Faso three weeks

<HEADLINE> Prices Hike After VAT Introduced in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Prices of goods in Dar es
Salaam suddenly increased Wednesday, the first day for Tanzania
to introduce the Value Added Tax (VAT), despite President
Benjamin Mkapa's warnings to punish unscrupulous businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The price hikes of a lot of goods have nothing to do with VAT,
whose primary objective is to expand the tax base and enhance tax
collection in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Kijitonyama and Milocheni areas, a kilogram of sugar was
sold at 500 Shillings (about 75 U.S. cents), up from 400
Shillings, while the retailed price of a bottle of beer in bars
and clubs increased from 400 Shillings to 600 Shillings. Rice
prices have also soared.
</P>
<P>
Petty traders in the kiosks along the Morogoro Road in the
capital city have also raised the prices of the consumer goods,
some of which are not among the list of goods under the VAT
system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through the radio to the nation on Tuesday evening,
President Mkapa assured that VAT, charged with a rate of 20
percent, will neither disrupt the economy nor reduce people's
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that several items are not included in the VAT,
noting that such items are crucial to the survival of low-income
earners.
</P>
<P>
He listed them as medicine and medical instruments for both
human beings and livestock, medical services and treatment, main
food stuffs including maize, rice, wheat, banana, cassava,
unprocessed meat and fish.
</P>
<P>
Education services for registered institutions, books,
journals and newspapers, water services, petroleum products,
public transport, house rent are some of the goods and services
exempted from VAT.
</P>
<P>
From July 1, it is forbidden to charge sales tax, stamp duty
and entertainment tax, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the public to inform the police or revenue officials
of any unreasonable price hikes.
</P>
<P>
"Businessmen who raise their prices for exempted goods like
foodstuff should be taken to task," he warned.
</P>
<P>
A lot of traders just could not explain what VAT is while some
others are spreading rumors that prices of all goods have
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
Mwima Kilongo of the Makumbusho Trading Center said that she
did not know what VAT means and asked the authorities concerned
to give more education on VAT "even by using churches and
mosques."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S. economic growth
could be finally slowing down, the Federal Reserve decided
Wednesday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market
Committee, concluded its two-day close-door meeting, signaling it
had left the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks
unchanged at 5.5 percent. It's been at that level since a quarter
of a percentage point increase in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The result was widely anticipated and financial markets showed
little reaction. Raising U.S. rates would have risked
destabilizing already-rocky Asian financial markets by giving
investors another reason to transfer their money to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the U.S. economy appears to be slowing on its own from
the robust annual growth rates of 5.4 percent in the first quarter
of this year. And consumer price inflation, running at a 1.5
percent annual rate during the first five months of the year,
appears well-contained.
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, reports the Japanese government will propose
major tax cuts boosted stock prices. In early afternoon the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 55 points, hovering about the
9,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his last
congressional testimony on the economy, on June 10, expressed his
concern that a shortage of labor would produce wage pressures that
would in turn produce faster price increases.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in April and May sank to a 28-year-low of 4.3
percent as a consequence consumer confidence, as measured by the
New York-based Conference Board, hit a 29-year high in June.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that higher interest rates may be necessary to
guard against a buildup of pressures, but gave no hint that the
increase was imminent. Economists said Greenspan and other Fed
officials are worrisome that raising U.S. rates will touch off
renewed financial turbulence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are signs, from declining factory orders to a
deteriorating trade deficit to a buildup in inventories of unsold
goods, that U.S. growth is set to slow significantly.
</P>
<P>
And the strike at General Motors started on June 5 has already
pushed up first-time claims for unemployment benefits. July
employment and industrial production figures likely will reflect a
larger impact.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expect the economy's growth rate to slow from a
rapid 5.4 percent in the first three months of the year to
something around 2 percent for the rest of the year.

LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- International aid donors are to meet

The government of Sierra Leone had a funding gap of about 34

"The IMF (International Monetary Fund) is convening a donors'
conference meeting in London on July 15 and 16 to appeal for
funding to fill our budgetary gap and for our balance of payments
requirements," Jonah said.
</P>
<P>
The budget covers the period from February 17 to the end of

<P>
Sierra Leone has been in a poor situation since the May 25
coup last year that ousted the legitimate government of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The junta that seized power through the coup was overthrown
last February, followed by the restoration of Kabbah's government
with the help of the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
However, the ousted junta has left the country's central bank
clean of all foreign exchange, according to a central bank
official.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official said that the central bank now has less
than 5,000 U.S. Dollars in currency reserves in its vaults.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation is partly attributed to the ban of
diamond and gold mining in the country, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Diamonds are Sierra Leone's main export. Kabbah has banned
mining activities until a proper mining code can be brought in
and also because the security situation is still precarious
outside the capital Freetown, especially in the main mining
areas.
</P>
<P>
The lack of foreign currency has slowed the import of
essential goods and the government has appealed for help.
</P>
<P>
"President Kabbah has had to beg in the past few days for the
World Bank to provide Sierra Leone with five million (U.S.)
Dollars so that the central bank can continue to operate," said
presidential spokesman Septimus Kaika.
</P>
<P>
"We hope they will give us the money soon and not wait until
September, when officials from the World Bank and IMF resume
talks with the government to get programs going again in the
country," said the central bank official.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the country's two main banks,
Barclays and Standard Chartered, are also suffering from the lack
of currency.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Build Electronic Media Training Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Namibia will build an
electronic media training center for practitioners in the
southern Africa, the Nambian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NBC Director-General Ben Mulongeni said that the institution
will introduce broadcasters and journalists to the latest
broadcasting technology.
</P>
<P>
The center will also serve the countries which are not members
of the Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA), said
Mulongeni.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes this would stop the monopoly of news
coverage in the region by foreign radio stations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nambian media chief, a radio current affairs
program for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is
due to be launched on July 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
The program will first go on air in Namibia before it is
distributed to other SABA member countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on Fresh Fishery Imports from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
announced Wednesday that it has lifted the ban on fresh fishery
imports from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the delegation of European Commission (EC) in
Dar es Salaam said that the EC is pleased to announce that the EC
import ban has been lifted for all fresh fishery products from
Tanzania after taking advice from the EC Veterinary Committee.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the decision, which becomes effective
on July 1, reversed earlier measures taken in January this year
to limit the import of fishery products.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed because EU countries feared that through
imports of fresh fish fillets from Tanzania and other African
countries, the cholera epidemic that erupted in areas at Lake
Victoria and other African regions will affect their food.
</P>
<P>
But EU has demanded that health certificate must accompany
each consignment of fishery products.
</P>
<P>
"European Union member states shall be in a position to refuse
all consignments not accompanied by this declaration from July 1,
this year.
</P>
<P>
"From July 1 of 1998, Tanzania Fishery Division of the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism is considered by the EC
as the competent authority responsible for the enforcement of the
EC regulations regarding hygienic conditions," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa, in a letter to President of the
European Commission Jacques Santer, welcomed the decision. Mkapa
expressed hopes that the European Union will further help
Tanzania develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to reports, similar bans on Kenya, Uganda
and Mozambique have also been lifted.

the Press Trust of India (PTI) said Thursday.

<P>
The cause of the fire was being investigated by the army, a

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans "Bridge Bank" Scheme to Settle Loan Mess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government and the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Thursday mapped out a
"bridge bank" plan aimed at settling the Japanese banking sector's
bad loan mess.
</P>
<P>
The bridge-bank plan is intended to prevent bank failures from
disrupting the rest of the banking system and the economy by
placing failed banks under government control. They are turned
into bridge banks that would continue extending loans to sound
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga told a news
conference that the bridge-bank scheme will be limited to failures
that occur until March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes measures to promote the disposal of bad
loans as well as steps to reinforce inspection and supervision of
financial institutions by the newly established Financial
Supervisory Agency (FSA).
</P>
<P>
The government and the LDP hope the plan will help restore
confidence, both domestically and internationally, in a recovery
of the long-stalled Japanese economy, government and LDP officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's bridge-bank system is said to be modeled on a United
States scheme in 1987 to deal with financial failures.
</P>
<P>
Bridge banks would be subsidiaries of a holding company to be
set up by the semi-governmental Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Independent panels will be established to determine which loans
bridge banks may inherit from collapsed institutions.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders welcomed the plan, saying the scheme
could help protect failed banks' borrowers.

<HEADLINE> Yen Devaluation No Alarm for Philippines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu Thursday said there is no cause for alarm over the
devaluation of the Japanese yen, adding that this is even more
advantageous to the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu explained that the devaluation of the Japanese yen
would even put the Philippine finances into a better position, as
it will reduce significantly its foreign debts in the Japanese
currency.
</P>
<P>
He said a huge amount of the country's debts are in yen, making
it easier for the country to settle these with a weaker Japanese
currency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he stressed that the Estrada administration
is determined to keep its limit on domestic borrowings, ruling out
the possibility the country will still be floating treasury bills
to raise additional funds for the government.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the government will only be able to incur around
2 billion pesos (50 million U.S. dollars) or less in domestic
borrowings to maintain its limit.
</P>
<P>
He expressed apprehension that floating more treasury bills and
increasing the government's domestic borrowing could further push
inflation upward.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands soccer team was puzzled
by a ban that stopped them from training in the Velodrome Stadium in
Marseille before Saturday's World Cup quarterfinal clash against
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said on Thursday the team had received a
letter from the international soccer body FIFA on this matter but was
confused by it.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very strange letter. We will try to train in the stadium.
It seems amazing that we cannot," Hiddink told a news conference in
Roquebrune-Cap Martin.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands have played South Korea in the stadium in the first
round and the FIFA said this has used up the team's one-game training
quota for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
If an appeal against the ban is not successful, the Dutch team will
train in a pitch at Aix en Provence.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urges More Open Australian Market for Textiles, Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has called on Australia to continue trade liberalization measures
and internal structural reforms to further open its market to
foreign textiles and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms launched by Australia in the early 1990s
have led to a higher growth of the gross domestic product (GDP)
and productivity, and to lower unemployment, said the WTO here
Thursday, in a report reviewing Australian trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said Australia has maintained the highest annual GDP
growth in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) since the early 1990s,.
</P>
<P>
"The economic reforms, including tariff reform, a reduction in
subsidies and the deregulation and privatization of many services
sectors, have improved the competitiveness of Australian business and
stimulated exports," said the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these benefits, Australia appears hesitant about pushing
ahead with reforms, especially for industries that continue to be
relatively heavily protected, such as textiles and clothing and the
automotive sector," the WTO said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO Secretariat report and a policy statement prepared by
the Australian government provided the basis for a review by the
WTO of Australia's trade policies and practices when delegates
from the WTO's 132 members met, on June 30 and July 2, to assess
the report and the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that the trade and structural reform process be
continued and completed to ensure strong growth in the long run,"
the WTO said. "This would also help reduce Australia's
unemployment rate, which is still above eight percent."
</P>
<P>
"Hesitation over pushing through further reforms create
anomalies and distortions in the tariff and assistance structure,
and may give mixed signals to producers and consumers about the
government's commitment to future reforms and their direction,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for ongoing reform to address regulatory
measures and structural rigidities that continue to impair the
competitiveness of Australian industry," the WTO report
concluded.

<TEXT>

MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief Superintendent Roberto
Lastimoso on Thursday took over from Director General Santiago
Alino as the new chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the turn-over ceremony, new Philippine President
Joseph Estrada vowed to provide decent housing facilities and
other benefits for police personnel in Metro Manila within three
years.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, 35 percent of Metro Manila's police
officers live in squatter sites.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he would go for the modernization of the
livelihood of the PNP personnel and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
He said he planned to give free college education to the
dependents of the police force.
</P>
<P>
Estrada confirmed that he has ordered Lastimoso to field 85
percent of the 100,000 PNP personnel to the streets to protect the
citizenry nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to see that the trust and confidence of the
citizenry would return now to the police.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada also vowed to put scalawag policemen in jail
because he would not allow "bad eggs" to destroy the image of the
PNP.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Cancels Trust Accord with Gazprom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Moscow has taken back the 35 percent
equity share it had in the gas giant, Gazprom, which was held in
trust managed by Gazprom's influential president.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko instructed Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov to announce the abolition of the contract
for trust management with Rem Vyakhirev.
</P>
<P>
The instruction was given at a meeting late on Thursday of the
state's representatives to Gazprom, the world's biggest gas
producer.
</P>
<P>
The contract between Moscow and Gazprom was signed on December
22, 1997, and was to end on March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government also ordered the State Tax Service to seize
property of Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
The move was reportedly triggered by Gazprom's defaulting on
current tax payments to the federal budget. According to Deputy
Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev, the company had paid only a third of
its tax payment by June.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov told reporters after the government meeting: "If
Gazprom repays taxes, everything will be OK."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev said "nobody, including
Gazprom, will be allowed, in a shameless way, not to pay taxes."
</P>
<P>
Moscow has begun putting pressure on companies in tax arrears
to pay up. The action is part of a government austerity package
aimed at avoiding financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
The government on Thursday acted against five oil companies by
restricting their access to pipelines used for exporting
oil. Another four companies which owned the state about 1.15
billion rubles (185 million U.S. dollars) were penalized Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is currently considering
a request by the Russian government for a stabilization loan of 10
to 15 billion dollars.

LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Thursday condemned a spate of arson attacks in Northern Ireland as
"barbarous behavior."
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Blair had discussed with
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam about the arson and said he
wanted to "go to underline his support for the whole peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"He said this sort of barbarous behavior is totally
unacceptable in this country. Violence from this or any other
quarter will have no effect whatsoever on the government's
policies," the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ten Roman Catholic churches were damaged in a wave of arson
attacks across the province, police said. Security forces were
linking loyalist terror group the Liberation Volunteer Forces
(LVF) with the attacks on the Catholic churches across the
province.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair told his ministers at Thursday's
cabinet meeting that the way forward in Northern Ireland was
through "dialogue and democracy, not intimidation and thuggery."

NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese ambassador to India
Hiroshi Hirabayashi said Thursday that Japanese investment to the
country might slow down in the short term as the business
community is apprehensive of the negative signals from India.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors, including those from Japan may at best like
to wait and see and at worst pull out" due to the negative shadow
cast by the recent Indian nuclear tests, deterioration in security
environment, looming sanctions, self-reliance rhetoric and
spillover effects of the East Asian financial turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While government officials are giving mixed signals, we are
hearing about 'saying good-bye to the World Trade Organization
(WTO)' and boycott of foreign goods from some non-government
quarters," he said at a meeting organized by the Federation of
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi said India was sending negative signals by imposing
a 4-percent special additional customs duty.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Up in Nepal in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Nepal
increased by 9.3 percent during the first six months of this year
compared with the same period of last year, the Department of
Tourism said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 181,209 tourists had visited Nepal through the air
route by the end of June as against 165,777 during the same period
last year, the department said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Visit Nepal Year '98 was launched in January with a target to
attract half a million tourists this year. Tourism is a major
foreign exchange earner for the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals are generally low in Nepal during the months
of June and July, but the figures were encouraging this year due
to tourism promotion activities in India and some West European
countries, the department said.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of Indian tourists has risen by 19.8 percent
during the first six months, and is expected to go up further as
the Indian government has decided to provide duty-free baggage
facilities to the Indian tourists returning from Nepal by air.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of tourists from Singapore and Hong Kong
has declined by 20 and 25 percent respectively during the first
three months of this year, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls on India, Pakistan to Join NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday repeated its call
to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry
said "Russia insists on immediate and unconditional accession" of
India and Pakistan to the treaty, and the revision of their
nuclear policies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 190 countries have joined the treaty, which took effect
in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995, he said. Russia
wanted the pact to be universal.
</P>
<P>
In a move that sparked global shock and concern, India launched
underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and triggered Pakistan
to follow suit late that month, despite the risk of bringing about
a nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition to the nuclear tests, Russia did not favor
sanctions against India and wanted to carry out military
cooperation with India if it respected Moscow's line on nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has developed and will continue to develop its military
cooperation with India within the framework of international norms
and national legislation," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Moscow would obviously watch Delhi's response to
Russia's line towards nuclear disarmament," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Alexei Yablokov, a well known Russian environmental expert,
told Interfax the NPT was, in effect, violated by Russia's plan to
supply India with nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Russia and India, on June 21, signed a deal supplementing the
Soviet-Indian agreement of 1988 on cooperation in construction of
a nuclear power station in Kudankulam, said Yablokov.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Grateful for Their Preservation" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton might
have been told the old Chinese saying that "Guilin's landscape is
the best under the Heaven," he was still caught unprepared when
presented with the breathtaking view of grotesque limestone peaks
along the crystal-clear Lijiang River this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The picturesque river, long enjoying the fame of the cream of
Guilin's landscape, personified a perfect Chinese ink and wash as
no other scene in the world will do, agreed Clinton and first lady
Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The 64-km and four-hour excursion on board the boat "Panorama"
took the Clintons through both a fine drizzle and glittering
sunshine, that presented a hazy look of the landscape. The cruise
enabled the Clintons to enjoy the scene featuring uniquely shaped
mountains and meandering river which inspired generations of
Chinese artists and poets, and whose beauty the president found
other words hard to describe except the constant exclamations of
"Great."
</P>
<P>
When the boat sailed by a scenic spot called "Nine Horses Paint
the Mountain," Clinton, with boyish exuberance, began to count the
number of natural formation in the shape of a horse on the cliff.
The guide told Clinton that fable has it that the person who could
make out all the nine "horses" would become the No.1 Scholar in
the highest imperial examination in ancient China, and one who
made out seven will become the No.2. Maybe, it was because of the
relatively high speed of the boat, Clinton said he could only
figure out eight "horses."
</P>
<P>
The boat stopped by a village at the lower reaches of the
river. After being greeted by village head Zhao Jialuo and a score
of school children at the village entrance, the Clintons were
led into the village which has a 492-year history.

<P>
Walking down the centuries-old slabstone road, the Clintons
were attracted by one particular house with its painted doors and
windows carved after intricate designs.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton asked when the house was put up and whether other
villagers also have houses with similar doors and windows, Zhao
Jiashuai, owner of the house, replied: "it was put up more than
400 years ago and my family were among the first inhabitants of
the village. Carved beams and painted rafters are part of the
Chinese architectural tradition, which is still being carried
forward in the village today."
</P>
<P>
Very interesting, Clinton commented.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president and the first lady also showed great
interest in the villagers' use of marsh gas generated from pig and
cow dungs as a fuel.
</P>
<P>
"The use of the march gas is an important measure we've taken
to protect the ecological environment along the Lijiang River, and
the residue from the pit may also be used as fertilizer," explained
Li Zhaozhuo, Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional
People's Government, who was accompanying the Clintons on the
tour.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked a villager to show him how to use the marsh gas
for cooking and lighting, and he clapped his hands at the sight of
the blue flames dancing on the cooking stove and a lamp. It's very
good to use the marsh gas in rural areas, Clinton remarked.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke highly of the beauty of the ancient-style houses
in the village, saying that life in rural China is very
interesting, while he posed for pictures with villagers and
Chairman Li before leaving the village.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons then got on the boat and reached the county town
of Yangshuo at 6:05 p.m. Before he got off the boat, the crew
presented Clinton a piece of exotic stone as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
"They (Guilin's landscapes) are alive, and we are grateful for
their preservation," Clinton said at the end of the boat ride,
referring to the good preservation of the landscapes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions Against Swiss Banks Threaten Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions against Swiss banks by
U.S. cities and states could harm "the good bilateral relations
between Switzerland and the United States", said the Swiss
government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A group representing some 800 local U.S. finance officials
threatened on Wednesday to impose sanctions against Switzerland's
three biggest banks for their role in handling Holocaust victims'
accounts during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of sanctions are counterproductive, unjustified
and illegal," the Swiss Federal Council (cabinet) said in a
statement. "They constitute a danger to the good bilateral
relations between Switzerland and the United States."
</P>
<P>
While calling on the U.S. government to prevent such sanctions,
the Swiss government said that it would support Swiss companies
that took legal steps against U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Swiss banks involved have indicated that they
may sue U.S. states or cities that will boycott deals with them.
</P>
<P>
The banks could also withdraw the 600 million U.S. dollars
already offered by them to settle their dispute with Holocaust
victims and Jewish groups, who have demanded an amount of 1.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have not made any decisions yet, of course, but we will now
consider steps... that could go as far as lawsuits," said Credit
Suisse Group's spokesman Ulrich Pfister.
</P>
<P>
"The question of what will happen with the settlement offer
being negotiated is open," Pfister said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Anti-Corruption Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on
Thursday approved an anti-corruption policy aimed at reducing the
enormous costs that widespread, systematic corruption exacts from
governments and economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
ADB President Mitsuo Sato said in a press release that it was
significant that all members of the Manila-based multilateral
bank's Board of Directors had agreed that corruption has a strong
negative impact on economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"This policy represents an extremely important extension of our
ongoing work on governance, and the culmination of extensive
dialogue with our member countries," Sato said.
</P>
<P>
The policy paper said that scarce resources are squandered on
uneconomical projects because of their potential to generate
lucrative payoffs, and priority sectors such as education and
health suffer disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said it will work with its developing member
governments in attacking corruption on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it will push to strengthen public institutions by
making them more efficient, effective, accountable and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
It will press for increased market liberalization and
competition to break up monopolies and increase choices for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
It will also raise anti-corruption issues in country program
development discussions with governments as part of broader talks
on sound development management.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Maldives Call for Greater SAARC Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Maldivian President Mamoon Abdul
Gayoom left here for home Thursday after a two-day visit to
Pakistan as the outgoing chairman of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Gayoom held official talks with Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and they called for a greater role of
SAARC in promoting trade and peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the forthcoming SAARC summit in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, late this month will "evolve further
guidelines for achieving the objectives of SAARC and promoting
regional peace and security," said a press release of the Foreign
Office.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that the peace and security situation in
the region has deteriorated following the nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan in May, the release said.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the need for the creation of a conducive
environment of harmony and trust in South Asia to accelerate
regional cooperation, the release said.
</P>
<P>
They recalled last year's summit in Male, the Maldives, where
the leaders of the seven-nation forum agreed on a process of
informal political consultations and on recommendations of the
Group of Eminent Persons to carry forward and operationalize this
process to promote peace and stability in the region, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also decided to maintain regular exchange of
visits at the political and official levels to further enhance and
expand the close, friendly and cooperative relations between their
countries, the release said.

<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Though due to set the all-time World Cup
appearence record for goal-keeper, Brazilian goalie Taffarel said he
still has not get the recognition he deserves.
</P>
<P>
Taffarel will play his 16th game in World Cup finals in the
quarter-final match between Brazil and Denmark on Friday, one more
than his compatriot Gilmar and Emerson Leao.
</P>
<P>
But Taffarel said he still tried hard to get the recognition he
deserved.
</P>
<P>
"In Brazil only strikers count. A goal-keeper is bad if he lets
in a goal, even if his team has won by six goals." Taffarel said.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Taffarel is a regular in the Brazilian team, but
he is not viewed as one of the stars as he is totally overshadowed
by Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Robert Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Taffarel said:"In Brazil people are crazy about football. But
they dream about wearing a number nine or number ten on their shirt.
If you're a goal-keeper you just don't exist."

winding up its 32nd plenary session here.
</P>
<P>
The summaries include one on the establishment of a Portuguese

DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation

the hill tracts after it signed a peace treaty with the region's
tribals last December ending the decades-long armed conflict
there.
</P>
<P>
Each of the complexes will have residential rooms for 100
persons, a banquet hall for 300 guests, an international-standard
health club, a shopping arcade, a 100-seat conference room and a
games room.
</P>
<P>
The complexes will also have facilities like hill-top
observation sheds, benches on hill slopes, children's game parks,
water sports facilities, tennis courts and rent-a-car service

<HEADLINE> Bubka Hopes Brazil, France Play in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's world pole vault record holder
Sergi Bubka said he was following the soccer World Cup competition
closely and hoped Brazil and host France would clash in the final.
</P>
<P>
"It would be great to see Brazil and France playing together in the
final," said the 33-year-old Bubka, who is an avid soccer fan.
</P>
<P>
"The level of play is excellent and the organization appears to be
very good as well, with every match booked out," said Bubka in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, a fan of the defending champions Brazil, said his favorite
player was the team's star defender Roberto Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Proof of his love of the sport came earlier this year, with his
participation in April's "Star Team for Children" football match in
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
He played alongside Price Albert of Monaco, motorcyling star Max
Biaggi, ski champion Alberto Tomba against a team of former Juventus
players.
</P>
<P>
"I played as a forward," said Bubka. "But I am equally at ease in
any position.. I just like to get out there and play."
</P>
<P>
Bubka will be travelling next week to Norway, where he will watch a
European Champions League match on July 9 in Oslo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Defense Spending Reduction: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has described as
"unfortunate" a reference in U.N. Resolution 1178 calling for
defense spending cuts on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government rejected such proposals, Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark Wednesday night upon his return from
Luxembourg, where he attended a working dinner given by the
former British European Union (EU) rotating presidency for the
Foreign Ministers of the 11 candidate countries for EU
membership, Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides expressed satisfaction with the content of the two
U.N. resolutions, 1178 and 1179 (1998) on the renewal of the
U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and the
Secretary-General's good offices mission on Cyprus, adopted
unanimously by the Security Council earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
He noted that their content has shown that "Turkish efforts to
upgrade the illegal regime in the Turkish-occupied areas of
Cyprus have failed."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, however, rejected a call made in the
resolution 1178 for the reduction in defense spending to help
restore confidence between the rival parties on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
1974 after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia. Turkey stations
at least 35,000 troops in northern island.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that the presence of Turkish occupationtroops on the i
sland is the reason forcing the Greek Cypriot side
to continue bolstering its defense.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the Cypriot government's readiness to
discuss a provision calling for the reduction of Turkish troops
in northern Cyprus and the freeze of armaments by the Greek
Cypriot National Guard, with the objective that a specific
timetable for demilitarization is agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for demilitarization, put forward by President
Glafcos Clerides in December 1993, calls for the disbandment of
Greek Cypriot National Guard and Turkish Cypriot armed forces, as
well as the withdrawal of Turkish forces from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the weapons should be confiscated and
transferred into the UNFICYP's custody and the money saved
through demilitarization should be deposited into a fund to
benefit the two communities on the island.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Promote Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today urged
enterprises across the country to improve their management systems
and promote technological innovation to keep their vigor and
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the
call after he visited three high-tech enterprises -- the Stone
Group, Beijing San Huan New Materials High-Tech Company of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and Zi Guang Group of Qinghua
University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We should support the development of hi-tech industries and
use the fruits of knowledge innovation to promote the overall
progress of the country's agriculture, industry and service
sector," he said. "This will help China maintain a sustainable
growth and become more competitive in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Li said the country will increase its investment and step up
the reform in colleges and research institutes, and support them
to cultivate more creative people for knowledge innovation.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization of scientific and technological results
is a key problem for knowledge innovation, he said, and
production, education and research should be combined more closely
to promote innovation.
</P>
<P>
He said officials at all levels should try to learn more about
the knowledge-based economy, abandon their traditional conceptions
and get ready for the challenges and opportunities brought by the
knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
More young scientific personnel should be trained for
innovation work, while middle-aged and senior scientific workers
still play an active role, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the high-tech development zones all over the country
should be further improved to become the dynamic power behind
knowledge innovation, and more intermediary service organizations
should be established to promote the development of high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the country will give stronger support to
knowledge innovation projects, which concern higher learning,
high-tech development and scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will encourage the development of both state
and non-state high-tech enterprises, improve the legal protection
of intellectual property for both individuals and enterprises, and
try to attract more talented people for knowledge innovation from
both home and abroad.

market outlook.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate, the highest in the world, almost
doubles the global average figure in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has also predicted that China's airlines will add 1,800
new jetliners in 20 years, with the value of the increased
aircraft totaling 125 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In terms of gross domestic product, the Chinese economy has
grown at an average rate 2.5 times greater than that of North
America and Europe, Boeing said, adding that China will have the
most rapid economic growth rate in the next 20 years.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
today issued new principles on the selection of 30 sample stocks
for the SSE 30 Index to make it more scientific, transparent and
fair.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the exemplary issues will be chosen based
on the principle of "in line with the state policies on economic
development," instead of the previous "being able to represent the
region."
</P>
<P>
The change will make the index closer to the international
practice and in line with the general situation of the country's
economic development, according to an official at the bourse.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the SSE 30 Index samples were readjusted once
every three months, with no more than 10 percent of the stocks
replaced by others. From now on, check-ups on the sample will be
done once every six months to decide whether any one need to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
A new expert consultative board will also be formed to replace
the former SSE Index Expert Committee, which will continue to be
responsible for the composition, selection and related work
concerning the SSE 30 Index.
</P>
<P>
The bourse began to publish the index in July of 1996, but only
one readjustment has been made on the samples.

LUANDA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Beechcraft-200, a South African
aircraft maker, would join the investigation to find out the real
cause for the plane accident which killed UN Envoy Blondin Beye.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the UN observation group in Angola
Wednesday said that the United Nations has sent an aviation
expert to the spot of the crash to supervise the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Beye and five of his assistants left Luanda for a five-nation
west African tour on June 26, to seek for support for the the
Angolan peace process, but the Beechcraft-200, which UN rented
from South Africa's Federal Air Company, crashed on route from
Togo's capital Lome to Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivory, killing
Beye, his five assistants and two pilots.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that UN has asked help from the
international civil aviation organization in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The death of Beye, the major coordinator in the Angolan peace
process, has rendered great difficulty to the implementation of
the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in 1994, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations sanctions against the Angolan opposition
force, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) went into force Wednesday, after UNITA refused to fix a
specific date to hand over the four "sensitive areas" to the
government as outlined in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The sanction will, among others, freeze the bank accounts of
UNITA and its leaders, ban the importation of diamond from Angola
so as to cut off UNITA's economic life lines from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and some countries have expressed their
support for the sanction.

<HEADLINE> New Method Promising for Treating Spinal Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
developed an innovative treatment of damaged spinal cords,
which has achieved promising results in lab tests on rats, a
report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This breakthrough could be good news for those paralyzed or
handicapped by injuries to the central nervous system, according
to a report released by the prestigious Weizman Institute of
Science, based in Rehovot, near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The new treatment was created by Professor Michal Schwartz of
the Neurobiology Department in the institute. Using the new
method, she succeeded in helping rats to regain partial movement
in their hind legs paralyzed by spinal damage.
</P>
<P>
It has long been known that "lower" animals, such as fish, can
repair damaged fibers in their central nervous system -- the
spinal cord and the brain -- and restore lost functions. In
contrast, mammals, including humans, can only repair injuries to
the peripheral nerves, while injuries to the brain or spine leave
them permanently paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
The new approach is based on Schwartz's theory which states
that the loss of this repair ability by the higher animals
occurred in the course of evolution due to a unique relationship
between the central nervous and the immune systems.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz believes this loss was probably dictated by the need
to protect the mammalian brain from the effects of the immune
system. While immune cells normally help to heal damaged tissue,
their access to the brain would disrupt the complex and dynamic
neuronal networks that build up during an individual's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Generally, when tissue damage occurs, immune cells known as
macrophages swarm to the injured site where they remove damaged
cells and release substances that promote healing. The central
nervous system of mammals or humans, however, is different in this
regard: when damaged, it is not effectively assisted by the
immune system.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's team discovered that this is because the mammalian
central nervous system has a mechanism that suppresses the
macrophages. As a result, macrophages are recruited to central
nervous system injuries at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
These findings led to a series of experiments on rats, focusing
on overcoming the limited ability of the damaged central nervous
system to recruit and activate the macrophages. They isolated
macrophages and incubated them in a test tube in the presence of a
damaged peripheral nerve. The macrophages, which received the
distress signals of the damaged peripheral nerve, became activated.
</P>
<P>
The researchers then transplanted the activated macrophages to
the damaged site in the central nervous system of the paralyzed
rat. Then the transplanted macrophages created a growth-inducing
environment around the damaged tissue, enabling the rats to regain
partial motor activity in their previously paralyzed legs.
</P>
<P>
A major innovative aspect of such treatment lies in promoting
the animal's own self-repair mechanism, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
But she said that at present the results have only been
achieved in tests on rats, and more research work has to be done
before applying the treatment on humans.

<P>
"There is nothing new since last Thursday when we lost contact
with the team," Kleiner said. "But we have information from
witnesses who said the six were seen walking with unidentified
armed men to an unknown destination."
</P>
<P>
"This makes us believe they have been abducted."
</P>
<P>
The six were travelling in three vehicles to Degah Bur from
Gode in the ethnic Somali region of Ethiopia when they went
missing. They intended to be there for a training workshop.
</P>
<P>
Degah Bur is about 160 kilometers north of Gode in the Ogaden
region of Ethiopia, close to the border with Somalia.

<HEADLINE> 1 Million Lebanese to Face Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1 million residents in
central Lebanon, including the capital Beirut, will continue to
face power cuts at least six hours a day on a rotating basis in
the coming two months.
</P>
<P>
This was caused by the partial breakdown of two major power
plants in the country, the Voice of the People radio reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Zouk plant's third power-generating unit failed in June
while the normal electricity supply of the Hazmieh plant has been
disrupted since Monday due to technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hawa, director-general of the Electricite du Liban
(EDL), Lebanon's national electricity company, said that
electricity has been rationed rotatingly among the affected areas
since June.
</P>
<P>
It needs two months to repair the failed units, Hawa said.
</P>
<P>
And the EDL could not assemble power from other parts of the
country because the nationwide transfer network would not be
completed for another 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 7 percent of Lebanon's 4 million residents suffer daily
electricity cuts currently, according to Hawa. It was only from
1996 that Beirut and its suburbs began to enjoy 24-hour-a-day
power supply.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Hit by Scorching Temperature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The temperature in this economic
center of China today hit a record high for the year, peaking at a
scorching 37.1 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The temperature is the same as the highest all last summer.
</P>
<P>
While many places in the Yangtze River Valley and south China
are being ravaged by torrential rains, Shanghai has been suffering
from a heat wave since June 30, when the temperature reached 35.4
degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists here say that the high temperatures are the
result of the sub-tropical high pressure from the west Pacific
Ocean which has blocked cold air from moving southward.
</P>
<P>
Official data indicate there has been relatively little
rainfall in Shanghai since May. Shanghai's precipitation normally
stands at 103.2 millimeters (mm) in May and 178 mm in June. But
this year the two figures are only 79.2 mm and 148 mm,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts say they expect high temperatures and little rain in
Shanghai this summer, with the number of days exceeding 35 degrees
Celsius expected to be double that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The weather pattern of high temperatures and little rain should
continue for several days in Shanghai, meteorologists
said.

WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton, in his last opportunity to address a mass
audience in China, said Wednesday that he would continue to speak
out on behalf of democracy and individual liberty, but that the
United States did not seek to dictate the path of China's
development.
</P>
<P>
-- President Mohammad Khatami of Iran lauded the Clinton
Administration for softening its tone toward his country, but
added that a concrete change in American policy toward Iran was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Representatives of U.S. state and city financial officers
decided Wednesday to go ahead with sanctions against Switerland's
three biggest banks, seeking to help force a settlement of
billions of dollars in claims from Holocaust survivors and their
heirs.
</P>
<P>
-- A military hearing officer in North Carolina has recommended
that the pilot and navigator of a Marine jet that killed 20 people
in a collision with a gondola cable in Italy should face a
court-martial on negligent homicide and other charges, Marine
Corps officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal

longstanding trade dispute.

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 2 (Xinhua)-- Health situation of the two
French men kidnapped by Somali gunmen in the northeastern coast
of Alula Town is deteriorating, according to reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One of the two men is now seriously sick and unable to eat
while the other started fasting from all kinds of food in the
past three days.
</P>
<P>
The captors have moved their victims to Buro village, 45 km
East of the port town of Bossaso, where a delegation of elders
sent by the traditional and political leaders visited them this
week, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the elders who had visited the French
hostages, the kidnappers have asserted that they won't accept
anything less than 75,000 US Dollars in exchange for the safe
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The elders are currently having discussions with the United
Nations agencies in Bossaso over all possible ways for the
release of the hostages who remained in captivity since June 5.
</P>
<P>
The two French nationals and their small boat had been
kidnapped by somali gunmen off the coast of the Northeastern town
of Alula, about 200 km East of Bossaso early last month. The
victims said they are kidnapped when they were sailing as
tourists from the French port of Marseille through the Canal Suez
and that they were heading towards Madagascar.

<HEADLINE> Germany Has not Offered to Withdraw: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the German soccer body
has denied that Germany had once made an widely-reported offer to
withdraw from the World Cup after a French gendarme was beaten to a
coma by some German fans last month.
</P>
<P>
"There are one thousand things in my mind when I heard the news
(about the attack). I was considering but did not make the decision,"
said Egidius Braun of the German soccer federation here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I had thought of a withdrawl but at the same time I said
'no' because it would be a victory for the other side (of the German
hooligans)."
</P>
<P>
He said the German hooligans should not have been allowed to leave
the country to enter France.
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem of the society. In my experience, the one way (to
prevent violence) is that they shouldn't be allowed to leave the
country... They need a stage for such kind of violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Braun again condemned the incident on June 21 because the German
hooligans had "damaged the reputation of their country".

JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli basketball star Oded
Kattache from Maccabi Tel Aviv would play for the New York Knicks
if the current lockout by the National Basketball Association
could end before the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
Kattache, 23, returned on Thursday with a one-year contract
with the team late Tuesday which would make him the first Israeli
to play in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
Although an NBA owners lockout that began Wednesday prevented
the actual signing of the contract, the daily Maariv said Kattache
would earn between 350,000 and 400,000 U.S. dollars a year with
the Knicks, less than he was expected to make with the Tel Aviv
team.
</P>
<P>
To some of his fans, the 1.93m Kattache is making a wrong move
since he had been offered a one-million-dollar contract to play in
Greece.

<HEADLINE> 1,500-year-old Tomb Found in City of Guilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A brick tomb with arched ceiling
which dates back 1,500 years has been found in Guilin, a scenic
city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists said the tomb was located 800 meters from
the site of the prefectural government building in the Southern
Dynasties (420-589), and that the location suggests that the city
had a small population then because tombs were built outside town
in ancient times, while government buildings were always built
downtown, according to the archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The find coincides with historical documents which recorded
that Shi'an Prefecture, present-day Guilin, had seven counties
with a total population of 22,490 during the Southern Dynasties.

</P>
<P>
In Guilin, Clinton had a discussion with seven Chinese
environmentalists, which lasted about 50 minutes, and delivered a

"No place in China is more evocative of the beauty of your
country than Guilin," he said, adding that the stunning mountains
along the Lijiang River are alive, and Americans are grateful for
their preservation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president noted that China is making active efforts to
protect the environment, and that the U.S. will step up
cooperation with China in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in China, the two countries have made marked
headway in the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president then made a boat excursion on the picturesque

his wife; Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Zhaoxing and his wife,
Vice-Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and Guilin Mayor Cai Yonglun saw
Clinton off at the airport.
</P>

Hong Kong is the last leg of Clinton's nine-day five-city state

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) today called for more efforts to eliminate
corruption on the part of some court officials because of a public
outcry.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures must be adopted, said Wei Jianxing, a member
of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee. Wei said the government must never allow a small number
of people to seek personal gain by abusing their legal power
endorsed by the people.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the remarks while meeting with heads of higher courts
across the country, who are attending a forum on rectifying
court work.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee has shown great concern over the
issue of building a high quality task force of court officials,
Wei told the participants.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, Chinese court officials have made great
contributions to the country's reform, opening-up, economic
development and social stability, Wei said.
</P>

He warned that corruption could destroy the courts' prestige
and image among the people.

<HEADLINE> China's Competitive Edge Improves in High-tech Industry Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In face of stiff competition in
the global high-tech industry, China boasts a group of high-tech
enterprises with their own intellectual property rights and
technological advantages, said Xu Guanhua, vice minister of the
State Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu made the remarks here today at a forum of China's high-tech
industry, adding that China's import and export volume increased
from 12.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1991 to 29.4 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, of which exports jumped from 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars to 9.6 billion U.S. dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
And, of China's export of high-tech products, those in the
fields of electronics, telecommunications and biology accounted
for more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that China's high-tech enterprises boast an
ever-increasing competitive edge in the field of information
technology and the scope of those enterprises is also enlarging
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the sales volume of computers made in China
covered more than half of the domestic market, and the
technological capacity of several brand-name computers made in
China could already compete with those of overseas brand-name
computers.
</P>
<P>
Xu said 53 high-tech state development zones set up in the
1991-1992 period across the country have made it more convenient
for China to turn advanced technology into a productive force.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's high-tech development zones achieved a gross
industrial output value of 310 billion yuan, and the annual
export of those high-tech zones reached 5.5 billion U.S. dollars,
which means that the annual growth rate of the two indexes over
the past six years has been 91 percent and 92 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that, although China's high-tech enterprises have made
great achievements, they still occupy an insignificant portion of
the national economy as a whole and, compared with the advanced
nations, China's high-tech enterprises are still lagging behind.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the incremental value of China's high-tech
enterprises accounts for less than 13 percent of the incremental
value of the country's industry, while in advanced nations such as
the United States and Japan, the percentage usually stands around
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xu urged China's high-tech enterprises to enroll more talented
young people, so as to give a strong impetus to the development of
China's high-tech enterprises and meet new challenges of the
global market.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Speeds Up Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has embarked on massive
accelerated privatization of its state-owned enterprises, a
report from Accra said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said a number of state-owned firms, including
Gihoc, a pharmaceutical producer, Twifo Oil Palm Holdings and
Barclays Banks of Ghana have been slated for sale in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Ghanaian government intends to
sell Gihoc for over 12 million U.S. Dollars. The British Unilever
multi-national group will acquire a 40 percent stock in Twifo
Palm Oil for six million Dollars, while the government's 40
percent holding in Barclays Bank is being sold for 9.5 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from foreign and Ghanaian institutional investors who
will bid for stakes in these firms, the report said, individuals
too will have a chance of becoming share-holders via the Initial
Public Offerings of these firms under the auspices of the
regulators and operators of the country's capital market.
</P>
<P>
Three others parastatals, including the Tema Oil Refinery,
Ghana Oil Company and the Cocoa Produce Buying Company, are also
billed for sale in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
This divestiture program, for which a Divestiture
Implementation Committee has been set up, will reduce the size of
the public sector and inject efficiency and qualitative
performance into the enterprises, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted international fund managers as saying that by
mobilizing private sector management and capital, Ghana is on its
way toward overall economic recovery.
</P>
<P>

mid-1980s by Ghanaian authorities, more than 120 have been either
sold or liquidated in more than 20 transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China and Kazakhstan will sign the
second supplement to the Border Demarcation Agreement between the
two countries during President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit to the
neighboring country, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang
Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
The second supplement will comprehensively and thoroughly
resolve border issues and will be of great significance in
promoting friendly bilateral ties between the two countries, said
Tang in reply to a reporter's question at this afternoon's
regular news conference.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that China and Kazakhstan are friendly neighbors
with a common border of more than 1,700 km, and said that the
Sino-Kazakhstan border was basically solved by the border
agreement China and Kazakhstan signed in 1994 and the initial
supplement to the agreement introduced in 1996. The two documents,
which defined the border alignment in most regions, resulted from
friendly negotiations carried out the spirit of equal
consultations, mutual understanding and accommodations over recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides recently reached a consensus on border alignments
for two remaining regions, and "the agreement to be signed during
President Jiang's visit will be the 'second supplement' to the
original agreement," according to Tang.

<HEADLINE> New Book on Chinese Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 edition of "China's
Foreign Affairs" has been published by the World Knowledge
Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The new edition, which contains 750,000 Chinese characters,
highlights China's views on the international situation and lists
the nation's diplomatic activities during the previous year,
</P>
<P>
The edition, compiled by the Foreign Ministry's Policy Research
Office, describes the world situation in 1997 as "generally
exhibiting detente and stability", and notes that large countries
are engaged in unprecedented efforts to adjust relations in order
to form state-to-state relations geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The work notes that the relentless efforts to create a
"one-polar" world has been rebuffed by other nations amidst the
rapid and irresistible momentum towards global multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the global economy continues to grow despite
the fact that steady growth in the future will be subject to
pressure resulting from the financial crisis sweeping many Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The book describes China's diplomacy in 1997 as "fruitful." It
notes that China continues to observe its independent foreign
policy of peace and advocates new state-to-state relations
characterized by nonalignment, the elimination of confrontations
and not targeting third nations.
</P>
<P>
China strengthened friendly cooperative ties with countries
around the world during 1997, while at the same time tightening
good neighbor relations with surrounding nations through frequent
high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
The book points out that China scored a breakthrough in Sino-US
relations and witnessed improving and developing relations with
other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China has actively participated in multilateral international
and regional affairs and advocated a new concept of security.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1,
1997, marked a major step in its peaceful reunification effort,
according to the edition.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that China firmly safeguardeds its sovereignty,
territorial integrity and national dignity, and has steadfastly
resisted all attempts to interfere in the nation's internal
affairs, as well as all other attempts to advocate "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
China also recorded new progress in foreign economic
activities. China's success in combating the Asian financial
crisis has readily exhibited the nation's contributions to global
financial and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The edition includes an overview on global situation, with
articles on relations with other countries and international
organizations, wide-ranging agreements, regulations and laws of
governing the nation's diplomacy, as well as major diplomatic
speeches by Chinese leaders.

LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- All aircraft entering and leaving
Nigerian airports are now to be accompanied by armed security
escort to the holding point of take-off to forestall cases of
aircraft robbery.
</P>
<P>
The new security measure came on the heels of the recent
robbery of an Air Afrique aircraft and vandalization and theft of
components of navigation and landing approach equipment at the
Lagos international airport.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) in a
statement Wednesday also announced that all unauthorized persons
found on the runway would be shot at sight, warning that security
personnel had been given orders to that effect.
</P>
<P>
FAAN said bushes and other obstacles on the runway were being
cleared for easy view of all equipment, while maintenance and
security staff had been equipped with radios and walkie-talkies
to monitor all equipment.
</P>
<P>
It also pledged to improve all lightening systems for adequate
security.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 years ago, a shoot-on-sight order was given to
security personnel at Lagos international airport following
incessant theft on the runway, the semi-government newspaper
Daily Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, some security personnel were arrested in
connection with the vandalization of the instrument landing aids
worth more than six million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, robbers attacked an Air Afrique Beoing 727
aircraft, breaking into the luggage compartment, when the plane
was waiting in darkness for clearance to take off.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Bounces higher, But Short-lived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar's bounce to
one-month highs proved short-lived Thursday as rumors suggested
Japan would put in place a bridge bank and declare permanent tax
cuts to jump-start its sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar sank to a close of 61.79, half a U.S.
cent lower than its strong finish Wednesday of 62.27.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore
said the market had spent the morning stalling for time, awaiting
the Japanese economic reform announcement.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party previously announced
tax cuts worth 2 trillion yen (about 7.1 billion U.S. dollars),
but it was seen as a temporary measure.
</P>
<P>
Moore said market participants were cautious and reports later
in the day from Japan suggested the package would not exceed
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Locally, a leading quarterly business survey reported that
Australian business conditions and confidence fell dramatically in
the June quarter as the Asian crisis continued to have a
detrimental effect on the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
National Australian Bank also said it anticipates further
downside on commodity prices and hence the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Based on fundamentals, commodity prices, interest
differentials and the current account deficit, the Australian
dollar is not undervalued at current levels," Oster said.
</P>
<P>
"With falling commodity prices and a worsening current account,
there is little up-side for the Australian dollar during the next
year," Oster said.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was trading at 85.92
Japanese yen from 85.79 and 1.1243 German marks from 1.1251.

<HEADLINE> Non-State-Owned High-Tech Companies Boom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China had more than 65,000
non-state-owned high-tech companies with more than three million
employees by the end of 1997, according to the State Ministry of
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister Xu Guanhua told government leaders and
enterpreneurs attending today's symposium that non-state-owned
companies scored total 1997 revenues of 555.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over 870 companies reported annual output values of at least
100 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of high-tech products manufactured by the
companies were developed internally, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
The companies invested 3.9 percent of their total 1997 revenue,
or some 21.6 billion yuan, in the development of new products. The
percentage for the sector was much higher than that for ordinary
state companies which invested 0.18 percent and for medium- to
large-sized state enterprises which allocated only 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that non-state-owned high-tech companies will play an
increasingly important role in applying research findings to
production, which will be the focus of China's industrial
development.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Serious Investors Still Thronging Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday serious investors are still
thronging towards Malaysia in a big way as the country remains an
attractive investment hub.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's political stability has been the factor pulling
foreign investors to set up their manufacturing facilities in the
country, Mahathir said at a press conference Thursday after
opening a semiconductor factory at the Kulim High-Tech Park in the
northern state of Kedah.
</P>
<P>
"These serious investors are different from fund managers who
only roamed from one country to another, making investments only
for instant gains," he was quoted by Malaysia's national news
agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that billions of ringgit of capital continued to be
injected in the country's manufacturing sector although Malaysia
was not spared from the current economic turmoil hitting the
region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, while opening the factory, Mahathir pledged that his
government would extend whatever assistance it could for serious
investors to indulge in an array of activities such as research
and development.
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason why companies (already operating in
Malaysia) generally re-invest in their manufacturing facilities as
they know that Malaysia is a good place to invest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the mere excuse of loss of confidence would not
prompt the serious investors to relocate their investment away
from the country.

<HEADLINE> Top Kenyan Coffee Houses Suspended from Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Four leading Kenyan coffee houses
have been indefinitely suspended from the weekly coffee export
auction in a row over representation at the International Coffee
Organization (ICO).
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Thursday quoted senior
industry officials as saying that the dispute revolves around
representation by Kenya's Mild Coffee Traders Association (MCTA)
of trade views in major forums, including the ICO.
</P>
<P>
The four coffee houses were suspended by the MCTA last week
for criticizing the association's performance.
</P>
<P>
"Following your suspension from Mild Coffee Trade Association
membership, the Coffee Payments Marketing Sub-Committee meeting
(held on Monday) suspended your participation in the auctions
with immediate effect...," the Coffee Board of Kenya said in a
letter sent to the four major coffee houses.
</P>
<P>
Leading coffee houses C. Dorman, Cetco and Pati confirmed this
week that they had received such a letter.
</P>
<P>
Coffee officials said Taylor Winch had also received a similar
letter, but traders at the coffee firm said they reserved comment
on the case.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's weekly coffee export auctions are held on Tuesdays.
All the four companies were absent from the auction this week.
However, the four trading houses declined any formal comment on
the matter, said the press report.
</P>
<P>
The row with the MCTA began two months ago when some coffee
houses claimed that their interests were not adequately
represented by the MCTA.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the suspended coffee houses represent about 70
percent of the foreign coffee trade in Kenya. They added that
major international orders could now be delayed by the action.
</P>
<P>
"At auction you obtain the best prices based on bidding. The
less number of bidders available, the limited number of bids and
the limited chances of obtaining maximum profits," one senior
coffee analyst in Nairobi said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's leading producers of quality
premium arabica coffees.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM: Ties with Israel Almost Standstill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Foreign Minister Jawad Anani
has said that Jordanian-Israeli ties are almost at a standstill
and both are at the minimum level of contact and coordination,
according to the official Petra News Agency here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Official contacts between Jordan and Israel are currently
numbered. Most of the contacts are minimized in certain fields
such as water (sharing)," Anani told reporters Wednesday night
after meeting the European Union ambassadors to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The situation can not be blamed on Jordan, but rather is a
result of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to
ruin every chance of reviving the long-stalled Middle East peace
process, Anani said.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with its relations with most Arab countries, Israel
adopts an intransigent stand and refuses to implement the already
signed peace agreements, thus making the ties, including that with
Jordan, falling down to the low points, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's president (Ezer Weizman) has himself indicated that
Mr. Netanyahu does not want peace, and so, and in the face of
this, we find ourselves forced to accept the minimum offer so
that we can maintain the line of hope," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second Arab country in the region after Egypt to realize peace
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official complained that the discussion to
implement items of the peace treaty, such as construction of
airport and sharing water resources, has always been under way,
but few is implemented in real terms.
</P>
<P>
In political aspect, the Jordanian-Israeli ties have never
picked up since they were hurt last year as two Israeli secret
agents were arrested in Amman for attempting to assassinate a
leader of the anti-Israeli organization Hamas.

Earlier figures released by the department show that there were
about 7,000 people out of job in the first quarter of 1998, when
the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Enhance Cooperation With China on Environmental Protection: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is determined to
strengthen cooperation with China in environmental protection,
visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton said in the picturesque city
today.
</P>
<P>
"Since Chinese civilization first began to express itself
thousands of years ago, its poems and paintings have sung of the
beauty of the land, the air, the water," he said in a speech in a
park in the city.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his admiration of the picturesque scenery of Guilin,
Clinton said: "No place in China is more evocative of the beauty
of your country than Guilin."
</P>
<P>
"The landscapes of Guilin...are alive, and we are grateful for
their preservation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech with the theme of environmental protection,
Clinton said that China is taking impressive steps to protect the
environment so as to secure its future. He cited some examples,
including spreading the use of lead-free gasoline and upgrading
inefficient stoves.
</P>
<P>
He noted that communities and provinces and the national
government are doing more to clean up rivers and that Chinese
scientists are fighting deforestation and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Chinese citizens are doing more to promote
public education about the environment, among families and
especially among children.
</P>
<P>
"In October at our summit, President Jiang and I oversaw the
beginning of a joint initiative on clean energy. This week we have
made important new progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We ill provide China assistance to monitor air quality. We
will increase our support for programs that support renewable
energy sources to decrease China's dependence on coal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are helping China develop its coal gasification and working
with the Chinese to make financing available for clean energy
projects through the Export-Import Bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the
Chinese Government launched a forum to coordinate sustainable
development and environmental protection last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries must work together to protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal that we can do together," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has the world's longest meteorological
records, which help people clearly to understand the problem of
global warming.
</P>
<P>
"Without any loss of economic opportunity we can converse
energy much more than we do; we can use clean, as opposed to
dirty, energy sources much more than we do; and we can adopt new
technologies to make the energy we have go further much more than
we do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before he made the speech, Clinton had a 50-minute discussion
with seven Chinese people on environmental protection in the Hall
of Odd-looking Stones in the Qixing Park.

<HEADLINE> WB to Help Jordan in New Economy-Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will help Jordan
set up a new system to accurately record its economic growth rate,
the Arabic-language daily Al Dustour reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Abdul Razzaq Bani Hani, director of the
Research Department of the Planning Ministry, as saying that the
move came as Jordan and the WB are markedly different in their
figures concerning Jordan's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The WB has recently revealed that Jordan's economic growth was
at most 1 percent and 2.5-3 percent in 1996 and 1997 respectively
as against the 5.2 percent and 5.3 percent released by Jordanian
government, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hani admitted that Jordan's economy declined in the past two
years and thus the WB figures were "more reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Once the new system sets up, Hani said, the government will be
working on providing official economic growth figures on a
quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani late Wednesday denied
that Jordan was trying to conceal real economic growth indicators,
saying that "We have invited the World Bank (officials) to Jordan
after we found that their economic growth indicators did not tally
with our estimations."
</P>
<P>
WB Vice President Kamal Dervish visited Jordan last week and
discussed the country's economic performance and the 1989-1998
economic reform program sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund and the WB.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said if the WB figures about Jordan's economic
growth prove to be true, the economic reform program will need
huge adjustments.

<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Football legend Pele criticised Danish
referee Kim Nielsen for sending off David Beckham in the match
between England and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"I think the referee made a mistake," said Pele, "I don't think
he saw the incident properly and Simeone is a very good actor."
</P>
<P>
Pele also criticised the way tournament officials have
interpreted FIFA's new ruling against the tackle from behind.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the players are feigning injuries, faking being hurt
and, because of the referees' weakness, they are making a lot of
mistakes." said Pele.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Volkswagen Produces One Million Santanas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive
Company Ltd. had manufactured slightly over a million Santana cars
by Wednesday to become China's leading automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German venture reached the milestone after 13 years of
operation. Santana model vehicles are currently produced with 92
percent of related parts and components produced domestically,
compared to a mere 2.7 percent when the venture commenced
operations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Volkswagen has an annual production capacity of
300,000 Santanas, with parts provided by over 300 suppliers and
after-sale services by 400 maintenance centers. Santas have
approximately a half of China's car market.
</P>
<P>
The venture produced some 230,000 vehicles in 1997, 26.3
billion yuan in sales for the year, ranking first amongst China's
top 500 foreign-funded industrial enterprises for the sixth
consecutive year. Shanghai Volkswagen also spent 800 million yuan
establishing a technical center to promote greater development.
</P>
<P>
The company's record period output for the first half of this
year exceeded 120,000 units, or 664 cars daily. The new Santana
2000-GSI has achieved positive results since being introduced to
the market in March.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Inflation Spirals Beyond Target: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's overall year-on-year
inflation spiraled beyond the official target of five percent in
June mainly due to rising food prices, statistics from the
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) showed.
</P>
<P>
Overall year-on-year inflation rose to 7.4 percent in June
from 4.6 percent in May, the East African Standard newspaper
Thursday quoted the CBK as saying.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem has previously said the
bank was targeting inflation at five percent by the end of June,
also the end of the 1997/98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp rise in overall inflation in June compared to May
reflects the higher food prices," CBK Chief Economist Maurice
Kanga said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kanga blamed poor infrastructure, especially roads, for the
drastic shift in inflation figures. Kenyan roads are in a weak
state of repair, which has meant that transportation of food
stocks to markets is slow and expensive.
</P>
<P>
Economists said a poor road network and a disruption in rail
service to western Kenya sparked a rise in food transportation
costs.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said the hike in year-on-year inflation was not expected
to be sustained because supplies of food and drink items would
improve in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said underlying inflation, which excludes
food prices, rose to 11.3 percent in June from 10.8 percent in
May.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly update on currency movements, the central bank
said the Shilling had gained to a mean of 59.50 to the Dollar in
the week to June 30.
</P>
<P>
It said the Shilling had gained to 99.26 against the Pound
compared to 99.44 the week before.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of the Shilling is mainly due to continued
foreign exchange inflows from tea, coffee and horticulture at a
time when demand for imports is low," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic money, the central bank said, tightened further
in the week to June 26 as payments related to the closure of the
fiscal year reduced liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
This caused the average interbank borrowing rate to increase
to 29.1 percent from 22.67 percent in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The average interest rate on the 91-day treasury bill
continued in a downward trend to 25.12 percent in the auction
dated June 29 from 25.40 in the previous auction.
</P>
<P>
The average base lending rate by commercial banks remained
unchanged at 27.97 percent, said the central bank.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise For 7th Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in Tokyo
for the seventh consecutive trading day Thursday, boosted once
again by foreign brokerages' heavy buying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors poured money into low-priced large-capital
issues such as steel and construction companies as Japan
accelerated efforts to resuscitate its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 108.69 points, or 0.66
percent, from Wednesday's close to finish at 16,471.58.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, however, slipped 0.29 point or 0.02 percent
to 1,270.46.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 920
million shares from Wednesday's 876.32 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Thursday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Nikkei's current upward trend almost mirrors
that seen in January and February when foreign brokers and
speculators suddenly became huge net buyers of Tokyo stocks.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said institutional investors were encouraged by
reports earlier in the week that the Japanese government may
induce a permanent income tax cut of 2 trillion to 4 trillion yen
(about 14.5 billion dollars to 29.0 billion dollars) next year in
order to boost sagging domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
surpassed losers 776 to 421, with 95 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abiola May Be Released to Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The release of Nigeria's most
prominent politician and business mogul, Moshood Abiola, expected
later Thursday may become the key achievements of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in his current visit to the west African
state.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, detained over the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential
polls which he presumably won, is said to be released to Annan,
according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived in the country Monday for a four-day visit,
has already held talks with both the head of state, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar and Abiola.
</P>
<P>
This cheery development, according to the Post Express, is
sequel to an agreement reached between the Nigerian government,
Annan and Abiola himself.
</P>
<P>
The detained politician may have already signed an
undertaking, part of which precludes him from traveling out of
the country till the conclusion of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Abiola may have also agreed to desist from demanding
the mandate resulting from the annulled election five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi also gave similar hint
when he said Wednesday that he would not be surprised that all
sides reach an agreement for the best interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the idea of releasing Abiola is informed
by the need to ensure that agreements reached between the
government and Abiola will not be violated after Abiola regains
freedom.
</P>
<P>
But Abiola would be free to join the presidential race, under
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This is part of General Abubakar's efforts to resolve the
lingering political crisis which has virtually brought the nation
to its knees these past five years.

Henry has a bad sprain and it is uncertain whether he will play,

Despite the injury problems, French captain Didier Deschamps

</P>
<P>
"We must be careful but we must not play with fear. It will be
tight but I really believe that we can win." Deschamps said.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps asked the fans not to expect too many goals in the
match:"If you don't have a tactical scheme going into a match
against Italy, you can pack your bags before kickoff," said
Deschamps, "We know that they will leave up no space and that we
will have only a handful of opportunities."

<HEADLINE> Americans Are More Internet Savvy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Widespread Internet use in the
United States has produced more Internet savvy Americans of all
generations, said a new study by MCI Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
An on-line Internet skills assessment revealed that the skill
levels of Americans rose to an average score of 82 percent, up
from 78 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The second MCI Great American Net Test also found that the
skill levels between men and women are fairly even, with 82
percent for women and 80 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
In terms of age category, the so-called Baby Boomers (age 40 to
60) and the Generation Xers (age 24 to 39) scored the highest, an
average 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher Internet skill level is good news for the country,
MCI said, quoting the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as saying
that the top three fastest growing occupations are
technology-related. Many other U.S. industries will also seek
employees with new media, Internet-based technology skills.
</P>
<P>
Respondents who access the Internet at home or work are doing
better than those who access the Internet at school.
</P>
<P>
The interactive on-line test covered a three-month period,
beginning from March 30. The test takers had to use the search
technology of the World Wide Web to find answers to nine
questions, including pop culture, world geography, arts and
literature, science and technology, and history.
</P>
<P>
The MCI study also found that most Americans believe the
Internet will still be around in the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
According to MCI, there were less than 300 computers in the
United States being connected to the Internet in 1981 and the
figure rose to 90,000 in 1989. More than 30 million computers may
have been linked to the World Wide Web today and the number could
double by the year 2000, the telecommunications company said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Without name-calling, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit Wednesday criticized Deputy Chief of General Staff Cevik
Bir for overestimating the influence of religious groups, saying
"this approach will tighten the bonds among anti-secularist
groups."
</P>
<P>
Bir said Tuesday that the Virtue Party, a successor of former
Welfare Party which was closed for its strong Islamic tendency,
would be the winner of the early general elections scheduled for
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The troubled Turkish-Syrian relationship witnessed another
positive step Wednesday when deputy foreign ministers of the two
countries held talks in Turkish capital Ankara on some sensitive
issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that an effective dialog mechanism should be
established between the two ministries in an effort to realize the
normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Zaman (Time):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur
Ersumer said Wednesday that the oil giant Shell had shown its
interest in participating in the planned Baku (Azerbaijan)-Ceyhan
(Turkey) pipeline project aiming to explore the abundant Caspian
oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Aksam (Evening):
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have said that
they do not think Austria, which just took over the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU) from Britain, will play a
positive role in improving the bitter Turkish-EU relationship.
</P>
<P>
Austria is a follower of Germany on key EU issues and it will
not go beyond the tradition this time, they said.

<HEADLINE> Prarastatin Reduces Risks of Repeat Heart Attack: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A study released Wednesday said
pravastatin, the cholesterol-lowering drug, can reduce risks of
repeat cardiac events among women who, with average cholesterol
levels, have already had heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the July issue of the Journal of the
American College of Cardiology, was conducted by a team of
researchers led by Sandra Lewis of Portland Cardiovascular
Institute in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied a group of 576 postmenopausal women who
had heart attacks 3 to 20 months earlier. All of them had total
cholesterol levels lower than 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl)
of blood, and low-density lipoprotein (also called "bad"
cholesterol) levels between 115 and 174 mg/dl, the investigators
reported.
</P>
<P>
The researchers randomly divided the women into two different
groups. One group took 40 milligrams of pravastatin daily for 5
years. The other group took a placebo pill daily for 5 years.
</P>
<P>
After just one year, the women taking pravastatin saw their
risks of coronary events drop more than 50 percent, with the risks
of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks dropping 55 percent while risk
of stroke dropping by 56 percent, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
"Women with a heart attack show strong, early reductions in
recurrent coronary events during therapy with pravastatin, despite
having average cholesterol levels before treatment," the authors
conclude. "Treatment will prevent an extensive range of subsequent
cardiovascular events."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Mozambique to Build Bridge over Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Mozambique plan
to build a bridge across the Ruvuma River on their common border
but the two countries have yet to reach an agreement on the
specific construction site.
</P>
<P>
The two governments have formed a joint technical committee
that will coordinate the construction of the bridge, John
Magufuri, the Deputy Minister of Works of Tanzania, has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly in the city of Dodoma
Wednesday, Magufuri said suggestions have been made to construct
ferries or bridges over the river.
</P>
<P>
The official was answering questions put by members of
parliament who wanted to know the government's plans to build a
unity bridge across the river, according to a report by The
Guardian paper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Mozambique share a border of some 800 kilometers
along the Ruvuma River without a bridge. People on both sides
have to use boats to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
Magufuri told parliament that facilities for the building of
the bridge have arrived in Tanzania, adding that the donor will
transport the facilities from Ngara District in Kagera Region to
the construction site in Ruvuma Region.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the British government has agreed to donate
a bailey bridge.
</P>
<P>
"The major problem, which is stalling construction of the
bridge, is Mozambique's reluctance to build at the suggested
Mitomoni area," the paper quoted Magufuri as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tanzanian government is still contacting the
Mozambican government on where to build the bridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Buhe, the vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, in a
meeting this afternoon with a goodwill delegation of the Chinese
Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, praised the group's contributions
to Sino-U.S. contacts
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Randall O. Chang, the president of the
Hawaii Chamber of Commerce, a large and influential organization
of Chinese-Americans in Hawaii that was set up in 1911. Chang said
that China has witnessed dramatic changes in the past two decades,
and that the Chamber of Commerce will continue to work to increase
bilateral economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The delegation included the 49th Narcissus Queen and four of
her princesses. They began their China trip on June 24 at the
invitation of the China Travel Service and the China Association
for International Friendly Contacts.
</P>
<P>
They visited Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing before coming to
Beijing. They are also scheduled to visit Xi'an, Chongqing, the
Three Gorges, Wuhan, and Guilin.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii sponsors an annual Narcissus
festival in which a queen and four princesses of Chinese descent
are selected for a goodwill delegation. This is the 18th China
visit by the delegation since 1981.

<HEADLINE> Copper Price Hits 10-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Copper futures fell to the
lowest points on Wednesday since 1988 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, according to news reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Copper for July delivery fell 1.35 cents to 72 cents a pound,
the lowest since the current contract began trading in July 1988
and reaching a 10-year low. The active September contract fell 1.2
cents to 72.60 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
Copper is heavy tied to the construction industry, with uses in
electrical devices, plumbing and wiring. Industry analysts believe
that the latest fall of copper prices was caused by three factors.
</P>
<P>
First, there are signs of a cooling U.S. economy. The Commerce
Department reported that U.S. construction spending fell by an
unexpected 1.5 percent in May, the first decline in six month and
the steepest drop since January 1994. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's index also foreshadowed an economic
contraction, with manufacturing activity falling to 49.6 in June
from 51.4 in May.
</P>
<P>
Second, there seems to be no quick recovery in Japan despite
new proposals to stimulate that economy. Japan is the
second-largest copper consuming nation behind the United States.
</P>
<P>
Third, The London Metal Exchange reported that the inventories
of copper in its warehouses rose for the first time in several
sessions by 1,250 metric tons to 248,900 metric tons.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Reform Promotes Rising Grain Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Chongqing have
expressed delight with the recent rise in grain prices which
reversed consistent declines recorded during the previous five
months.
</P>
<P>
The upturn has been attributed, at least in part, to the success
of the ongoing reform of the grain marketing sector which urges
state grain purchasing enterprises to adhere to government-set
purchasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Government policies stipulate that grain must be purchased at
subsidized prices when market prices fall below designated levels.
</P>
<P>
Local pricing authorities report that grain price rose by an
average one to two jiao (8.3 jiao equals 10 U.S. cents), with the
highest jump hitting 3.5 jiao in Chongqing, one of four Chinese
municipalities administered directly by the central
government. Price rises were also recorded for vegetables and pork.
</P>
<P>
The fact that some grain purchasing companies previously
lowered prices to remain competitive caused prices of grain,
vegetables, pork and other types of farm produce to fall by a wide
margin. Falling prices reduced the municipality's price level by
five percent for the first five months of this year and adversely
affected the city's normal economic growth pattern.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Orders Cut in Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has directed
all oil producing companies in the country to cut down on their
production to reflect its commitment of further reduction in
output by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
The directive issued Tuesday took effect as from Wednesday,
the Daily Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria reduced its crude oil production last April by 125,000
bpd and further agreed to cut output by 100,000 bpd in line with
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decision
last week to boost oil prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The national daily quoted economic analysis as saying that the
100,000 bpd reduction in output translated to a drop of about 306
million U.S. Dollars in the 1998 projected revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government was expecting a revenue of 9.8 billion Dollars
from oil export this year.
</P>
<P>
With the fresh cut, Nigeria's oil production stands at 2.033
million bpd, while companies have made plans to expand output.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang's Speech Boosts HK's Confidence: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
speech at a ceremony here Wednesday to mark the first anniversary
of Hong Kong's return to the motherland has greatly boosted the
confidence of the Hong Kong people in overcoming the temporary
economic difficulties caused by the Asian financial turmoil,
local newspapers commented here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang Zemin gave very positive comments on the
successful implementation in Hong Kong of the concept of 'one
country, two systems' and the achievements scored by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government led by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa. He also reaffirmed the central
government's strong support to the SAR government," said the
Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po in an editorial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the local business sector and community expressed
their full confidence in overcoming the temporary economic
difficulties caused by the Asian financial turmoil, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Jiang offered the Central government's
six-point "active supports" to the HKSAR government concerning
Hong Kong's finance and economy, tourism, investment in the inland
areas, high technologies and infrastructure, re-exports vis Hong
Kong and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"They will serve as a big encouragement to Hong Kong's economic
development," the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is in a more favorable position than others and has
more room for maneuver in combating the temporary economic
difficulties as it enjoys the backing of the motherland with a
population of 1.2 billion and a fast-growing and prosperous
economy," the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The six-point "active supports" offered by President Jiang
greatly encouraged the Hong Kong people, and the latest decrease
of interbank rates beginning July 1 in the inland areas also
served as a support to Hong Kong's economy, said Hong Kong
Commercial Daily said Thursday in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang spoke highly of the Hong Kong people who carry
on the tradition of loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong and
keep working as masters of the land, contributing to the

HAIKOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost Hainan province
will take effective measures to ensure eight percent growth rate
in the economy this year.

<P>
Agricultural added value output is expected to rise by 8
percent this year, with per-capita income of farmers expected to
reach 2,500 yuan (300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
To reach its goal, the province will attatch importance to fine
crop strains and wide-spread use of practical agricultural
technology, by promoting the use of 100 technologies this year,
and speeding up construction of wholesale farm and sideline
products markets and information outlets for vegetable and fruit
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will try to develop ocean fishing by giving
priority to the offshore aquaculture and will reform local state
businesses and help them to increase economic returns. And Hainan
will also ensure a moderate increase in fixed assets spendings.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Fixed Asset Investment In Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
allocated 16.4 billion yuan for fixed assets investment in the
first five months of this year, as part of the move to increase
local demand.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 41 percent increase in the investment from
the same period of last year, a level that is 28 percent higher
than the national average, according to the Provincial Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the five-month period, the provincial government approved
546 new projects, 264 more than for the same period last
year. Major projects included the Mianhuatan Hydroelectric Power
Station and the Meizhou Thermal Power Station.
</P>
<P>
Residential housing sales were up an amazing 97.8 percent in
the first five months, at 778,000 sq.m. of floor space.
</P>
<P>
Local economists attribute the increase in government
investment to a concerted effort in many parts of Fujian, and to
more simplified formalities and closer coordination between the
government and key project supervisors.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Inspects PLA Troops in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Thursday morning inspected the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
troops stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) at the Stonecutters Island Naval Base.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang arrived at the naval base, he was greeted by General
Tao Bojun, commander of the Guangzhou Military Area Command of the
PLA, and leaders of the HKSAR Garrison.
</P>
<P>
In the company of PLA Chief of General Staff General Fu Quanyou
and HKSAR Garrison Commander Lieutenant General Liu Zhenwu, Jiang,
who is also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, reviewed the guard of honor of the three
services of the PLA garrison troops stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After the inspection, Jiang addressed a gathering of officers,
praising the garrison troops for having done well in the past year
since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997 with support and
help from the SAR government headed by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he was pleased to visit the PLA troops
stationed in Hong Kong on the occasion of the first anniversary of
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang came to Hong Kong from Beijing Tuesday afternoon to
attend celebrations of the first anniversary of Hong Kong's
return to China and of the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended his best regards to the officers and men of the
garrison on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council
and the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is a major gratifying event to all the
Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots and overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in the past year the SAR government
headed by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa has achieved great successes under the
guidance of the correct policies and principles of the central
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He told the officers that he believed Hong Kong, under the
leadership of the SAR government, will overcome the temporary
difficulties caused by the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during his stay in Hong Kong he has felt the
enthusiasm and unity of the Hong Kong people. This enthusiasm and
unity, together with other factors such as a sound economic legal
system, a solid economic foundation and a great number of well
educated and trained mangement personnel in the local business and
financial sectors, Hong Kong can certainly ride out of the
difficulties, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, as the supreme commander of the PLA, called on the
officers and men of the garrison in Hong Kong to continue to
strictly abide by the Basic Law, the Garrison Law and laws of the
HKSAR and to do their work better.
</P>
<P>
Among those present on the occasion were Qian Qichen,
vice-premier of the State Council; Zeng Qinghong, alternate member
of the Political Bureau, member of the secretariat, and director
of the General Office, of the CPC Central Committee; and Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR Government.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bank Workers Plan to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan bank workers are planing to
go on strike at the end of this month, threatening to paralyze
banking operations across this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Their unions, the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied
Workers (KUCFAW) and the All Banks Shopstewards Committee, have
agreed to give the government a 21-day strike notice starting
Friday, national media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bank workers are grousing over a tax recently imposed on
low-interest staff loans. They also want the recently introduced
fringe benefit tax removed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The union's drums of war are ready, the hammer is ready to
hit and our secretary-general has released the arms to you with
which to fight for what is yours," said Jackson Mukolwe, KUCFAW's
assistant secretary-general in charge of bank issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice but to formalize the strike notice to the
Minister for Labor," said the union's deputy secretary general
Olilo Nyumba.
</P>
<P>
Pressure for industrial action mounted when bankers froze
loans to staff following the introduction of the fringe benefit
tax earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
KUCFAW Chairman Rasugu Ogamba said it was wrong for the
government to snatch from bankers a benefit which they have
enjoyed over a hundred years.
</P>
<P>
He asked Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae to consult bankers to
evade tampering with policies likely to cause chaos in the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Shelling Kills Lebanese Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was killed in
Israeli troops' shelling on villages in south Lebanon early
Thursday morning, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese civilian was killed when Israeli shells landed at
the village of Hadaita on the edge of the western sector of the
Israeli occupied area in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops also heavily bombarded other villages along the
occupied zone with the assistance of helicopters, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks came immediately after the Hadaita post,
which has long been held by Israeli troops, was seized by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that from 5:20 am local time (GMT
0200), its fighters began to launch offensives against Israeli
posts along the northern edge of the occupied zone and eventually
took control of the post at Hadaita.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army sources said three of its soldiers and one member
of its allied South Lebanese Army (SLA) were wounded in clashes
with Lebanese guerrillas. One of them is in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern
border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is the most active Muslim group in Lebanon to fight
against the 2,000-strong Israeli occupying forces and the 2,500
SLA militiamen.

<HEADLINE> IMS-GT Members Urged to Collectively Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the
Indonesia- Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT) have been
urged to adopt a pro-active role in investment and trade
facilitation to ensure continued tourism investment.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation in tourism has been acknowledged as one of
the strategies that should be fully capitalized upon in order to
gain from rich long-haul markets, Malaysian Culture, Arts and
Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik said when opening an
international conference on tourism development in the IMS-GT in
Johor Baharu, southern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This required governments of member states to adopt a
pro-active role in investment and trade facilitation to ensure
continued tourism investment and trade cross flows within the
IMS-GT region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the tourism industry has been acknowledged as a
fast-track project of the growth triangle because the industry
was relatively matured and represented an important source of
foreign exchange and employment opportunities for the local
population.
</P>
<P>
"We should brace ourselves from now to adapt to the changing
scenario of the tourism industry of the future. The next
millennium would pose a greater challenge to the industry with
stiffer competition, declining profit margins and the development
of other new tourism markets and products," he was quoted by
Malaysia's news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
These challenges could only be met by enhancing the
comparative and competitive advantages especially in the aspect of
quality of services which has been the strength and edge of the
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector of the IMS-GT to venture into
collaborative promotional programs and joint tour packages that
would enable the industry to offer greater variety of events and
destinations to potential tourists.
</P>
<P>
The current regional economic crisis and local currency
depreciation required the respective governments to identify a
strategic approach to expedite recovery from the slump, he said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis should not be considered as a burden but rather an
opportunity to intensify efforts towards enhancing tourism
promotion and marketing activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the tourism sector contributed a significant gain
to the regional economy, with an equivalent of 4.4 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam --
received 31.7 million tourists with total receipts of 31 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Malaysia's third revenue earner, after manufacturing

in the early '90s, a target of 12.5 million tourist arrivals was
set with projected revenue of 8.3 billion ringgit (about 2 billion
dollars at current rate) by 2000, but this target was achieved
much earlier, in 1994 when tourism brought in 8.9 billion ringgit
(about 2.2 billion dollars).

MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Thursday that it has reduced the lending rate on its U.S.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Chooses AMD Chip for New PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard, one of the
giant computer-makers, has chosen a new AMD chip in two new models
of personal computers, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chip is AMD's new K6-2 processor equipped with advanced
multimedia and three dimensional capabilities, called the 3DNow
technology, which analysts have said is more advanced than Intel
Corp.'s current multimedia technology known as MMX.
</P>
<P>
The models are two of Hewlett-Packard's just-announced Pavilion
personal computers, running at speeds of 300 megahertz and 333
megahertz, AMD added.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard's new Pavilion line features six models. Among
the rest four models, three are using Intel's Pentium II
processors and one uses Intel's lower-cost Celeron chip for the
"basic" PC market.
</P>
<P>
The six Pavilion models, all with Microsoft's Windows 98
pre-installed, are Internet-ready. Retail prices will range from
999 dollars to 2,049 dollars, depending on the configuration,

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees No Cash for Kenya in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya must meet its promises on
taxes and corruption before a suspended International Monetary
Fund (IMF) loan can start again, and payments are unlikely in
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Evangelos Calamitsis, head of the IMF African
Department, said there is a chance that the payments on the
three-year credit could resume in the financial year to end on
June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Before we actually sign on the dotted line, we may need to
see some action... It would be very tight to resume lending this
calendar year," Calamitsis was quoted by Thursday's media as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"But everybody has said they hope that something can happen
before the end of the fiscal year," he said in Washington
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF halted its lending program to Kenya on July 31 last
year, citing poor governance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
The IMF demands the probe on the Goldenberg corruption case be
speeded up, an independent anti-corruption agency be set up, the
independence of Kenya Revenue Authority be guaranteed and
problems facing the energy sector be tackled with.
</P>
<P>
"Some movements have been made on the last three, but the
first point (the Goldenberg case) is still outstanding," said
Calamitsis.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Kamlesh Pattni, his Goldenberg company and three
former senior government officials have pleaded not guilty to
charges of stealing billions of Shillings from Kenya's Treasury
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said their next mission to Kenya was tentatively
expected in September, but that would not yet be the forum to
decide whether to recommend that the IMF restart payments on the
205-million-U.S.-Dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy grew just 2.3 percent in 1997, failing to keep
up with the population growth of about 2.5 percent in 1998, the
Central Bank says, adding, it expects a pick-up in growth this
financial year.
</P>
<P>
Since the cut of IMF aid loans, the economy in this east
African country has been severely hit.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Completes Work on Solar Pilot Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- With the completion of work on the
country's 62-kw photovoltaic pilot project in the northeast
Narsingdi district, more Bangladeshis living in remote areas will
soon be able to use electricity in their daily life.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the pilot project, which was
now at the final stage of implementation, would help the nation
enter into an arena of renewable energy, said a report reaching
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The work on the pilot project, covering isolated islands of 29
square kilometers with about 8.500 households, started in January
1994 and ended in December 1997, but its commercial energization
only started in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 solar energy consumers would be provided with
electricity under the program, Abdul Halim Mollah, chief engineer
of the Rural Electrification Board (REB) responsible for
implementing the project, was quoted as saying. And under the
expansion program, about 50,000 consumers would be provided with
selectivity in the district, he added.
</P>
<P>
In view of its successful implementation, the Energy Ministry
and the REB was considering expansion of the project by bringing
areas of different districts under it, and donor agencies had
shown interest in funding more similar projects, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has deputized a local firm to conduct a
socio-economic survey on the financial viability of the project,
based on which the bank would provide 5 million U.S. dollars from
its Global Environment Fund for the project.
</P>
<P>
Kishoregonj and Natore, 88 kilometers northeast and 172
kilometers northwest of here respectively, has been identified by
experts as prospective areas where the World Bank-financed project
could be implemented, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Roughly five out of every six people of the country's 127
million population have no access to electricity consumption,
particularly in the remote areas, where consumer density is low,
and which are unlikely to be covered by the national grid network
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In this context, experts said, renewable energy is a viable
option for the country.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China University Receives Certificate Of Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Maritime University in
China's northeast Liaoning Province has been given certificates of
authentication by the Norway Classification Society.
</P>
<P>
Four quality standards -- the ISO9001 quality system, the
Norway Classification Society, the maritime training center
management standards, and nautical simulated articles center
management standards -- mean that Dalian Maritime is the first
university in the world to meet the requirements of Standards of
Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978, as
amended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As the amount of ocean shipping increases, shipping industry
need for educated and trained seafarers are becoming more
acute. Studies have found that more than 80 percent of the
maritime accidents were caused by human factors.
</P>
<P>
The International Maritime Organization noted that nautical
education and training organizations should have systems of
standardization that guarantee the quality of training and the
standards, which will be fully implemented on Feburary 1, 2002,
mean that signatory nations will not acknowledge certificates of
seafarers' sea worthiness issued by a country which violates those
standards.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the signatory nations of the STCW
Covenant. Dalian Maritime University, the biggest university of
nautical education in China, was listed as one of the most famous
maritime universities in the world by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The university began to establish a quality security system
that met international standards last year. The quality security
system was given certificates of authentication by the Norway
Classification Society and the China Maritime Supervisory Bureau
this June.

<HEADLINE> Milk, Dairy Products in Short Supply in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's milk and dairy products
are in short supply because 20,000 dairy cows were lost in recent
droughts.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the shortage, producers could only supply half
the potential local and foreign markets, prompting high imports
of dairy products, The Herald daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Dairy Farmers (NADF) said
Wednesday high input costs of stock-feed and veterinary products
had cast a dark cloud over the market as producer prices remained
well below the expectations of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
At least 75 percent of dairy producers' input costs go toward
feeding the cows. Prices of stock-feed rose by about 60 percent
at the beginning of the year and milk production subsequently
dropped on average from about 500,000 liters a day to 390,000
liters.
</P>
<P>
NADF Chairman Dave Conolly said the failure by farmers to meet
the demand by local processors had forced wholesalers to import
dairy products, mainly from South Africa.

</P>
<P>
Huaxia and Nanfang, two national securities dealers, have

The technology and equipment used by these dealers have made
the stock trading more efficient and have enabled investors to

</P>
<P>
Local dealers have helped investors understand the ins and outs
of the securities business and laws and regulations, and, as
competition has grown, they've adopted various ways to promote
their business, sending staff members out onto the street to drum
up business or by sending customers on holiday or by giving
lectures or consultation.
</P>

A city official in charge of the industry says that local
securities dealers have made some progress in standardization,
marketing, and professional training, but a few have broken the

<HEADLINE> AL: Arabs Oppose Aggression Against Fellow States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL)
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Wednesday that the
22-member Arab group is opposed to aggression on any Arab country,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when commenting on a missile attack on an
Iraqi radar site by a U.S. fighter jet Tuesday, upon his returning
here from a visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
But the AL chief said that so far he has not received any full
details or information about the incident.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. F-16 fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi radar station
on claims that Iraq radar locked on British patrol planes on a
routine mission over Iraq's southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Denied Tuesday that it targeted any of the British patrol
planes and called the U.S. missile attack another proof of
Washington's hostile policy.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed a lull in the U.N.-Iraqi standoff over
U.N. inspections of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, which
involved a buildup of U.S. and British forces in the Gulf earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is pressing for an end to U.N. sanctions imposed after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The U.S.-led multinational allied
forces drove Iraq out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid was in Syrian capital Damascus to take part in
three-day meetings of the Arab tourism ministers. He held talks
with Syria's senior officials as part of the effort to unify the
Arab stance on the Middle East peace process, which has been
deadlocked for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
His talks there underlined the importance of holding an Arab
summit to tackle the challenges stemming from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline policy and the worsening
situation in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Agreement For Export Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of China
(EximBank) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)
signed an agent bank agreement today to increase support for
machinery exports.
</P>
<P>
The EximBank will give the ICBC the power of agent to handle
export business through its nationwide branches. The ICBC has so
far handled about 3.3 billion yuan (398 million US dollars) worth
of this business already, accounting for more than a third of
EximBank's total.
</P>
<P>
EximBank is a Beijing-based policy-oriented bank that was
founded in 1994 to finance electronics, machinery, and other
capital goods exports, and provided financial support for 9
percent of exports of these products in 1997. It has no
subsidiaries in other parts of the country and has signed similar
agreements with a number of other banks like the Bank of China,
the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and
the Minsheng Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
To further increase exports, the bank plans to increase its
credit line by 60 percent this year over 1997 to 24.3 billion yuan
(2.9 billion US dollars).

NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Kenyan newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Mozambique's first multi-party municipal council elections
have gone off peacefully but warily, following on 1994 general
and presidential elections which put the final seal on resolving
a 16-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation:
</P>
<P>

claimed the lives of about 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
-- Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir has signed a new
constitution for his country into law, after calling on
opposition members in exile to return home and participate in
national construction.
</P>
<P>
East African Standard:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Painful Reform in Thailand: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the side effects of the IMF remedies are also evident.
Critics insist that the economic situation has got worse since the
IMF-initiated reforms were launched. For one thing, exports have
not shown any signs of a pickup, registering a negative growth of
2.7 percent in the first four months of this year. It is obvious
that currency devaluation is not helping Thai exports because all
neighboring countries, which are Thailand's competitors, have also
been suffering from competitive devaluations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the extraordinarily high interest rates and the huge
amount of non-performing loans in the financial system have
combined to plunge the Thai economy into a recession, raising
fears as to whether the recession will develop into a full-blown
depression.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity crunch, a by-product of the tight monetary
policy, has become a drag on economic recovery. Experts say
Thailand needs 26.1 billion dollars in capital inflow over the
next 12 months to overcome the present tight liquidity.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the drastic reform, a total of 3,961 enterprises
were closed down between January and May this year, boosting the
number of the unemployed to 2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Economic hardships have degraded living standards by more than
20 percent, driving more and more people to below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
Despite these adverse consequences, the Thai government has
pledged to continue the reform. Government officials have
indicated that Thailand has no choice but to stick to the IMF
remedies and the Thai people have to wait for the IMF medicine to
work.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts predicted that it might take three more years
for the Thai economy to show any sustainable signs of growth. At
present, only one thing is clear: The next three to four months
will be most critical for the country as the economy is expected
to hit rock bottom.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Shapiro Journalism Education
Foundation granted the prestigious Shapiro Prize to 14 editors and
reporters from Xinhua News Agency today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The prize was established in honor of Michael Shapiro, a member
of the British Communist Party who started work at Xinhua in 1950
at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro spent some 36 years polishing stories for the
Department of Home News for Overseas Service prior to his death in
1986. Deng Xiaoping referred to Shapiro as "a staunch
international soldier and sincere friend of the Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
The foundation was established by Shapiro's relatives in London
to help improve English language reporting in China.
</P>
<P>
The prize was granted to a number of teachers and students at
the Chinese School of Journalism. A total of 126 people have won
the prize since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua President Guo Chaoren attended the ceremony along with
Shapiro's widow and son. Today's awards ceremony was the fourth
since initiation of the prize.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua's English service was introduced over a half century ago
and currently serves thousands of media subscribers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Guo noted that Xinhua has grown into a major international
agency.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Boosting Provincial Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The private sector of southwest
China's Sichuan Province is becoming the most active component of
the local economy as well as a new economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
The sector, with 1.6 million household-run firms employing 2.5
million people, had 42.8 billion yuan in output value last year,
accounting for 19 percent of the province's gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
And it also turned in 3.8 billion yuan in taxes, making up 22
percent of local revenues, according to the provincial Bureau for
Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The province adopted measures to encourage private businesses
to take on multiple forms, to participate in the effort to merge,
purchase, operate on contracts, and buy into state-owned and
collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Now, an increasing number of private firms are ending the
single-product practice; instead, they are turning to diversified
market economies and performance, undergoing a shift from
extensive operations to intensive ones, and from small production
to the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has set up 15 experimental zones for private sector
development. Statistics show that the zones registered an average
increase of more than 30 percent in output value and pre-tax
profits.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Painful Reform in Thailand: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand began to float the baht
against the U.S. dollar on July 2 last year, unleashing an
economic nightmare which soon spread to Southeast Asia and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The past year witnessed painful efforts Thailand has made to
tide over the economic woes which are gripping the country with an
intensity that the country has never seen in decades.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Tuesday tried to play down the
anniversary of the baht float, making it clear that ramifications
of the sharp devaluation of the baht are still present and painful
and will continue to be so at least until next year.
</P>
<P>
From 25-26 baht to the U.S. dollar during the 13-year currency
peg system, the Thai currency collapsed to 57 baht a dollar in
mid-January this year before recovering to 38-39 baht for the most
part of March and May. Since then it has weakened again, moving
beyond the 40-baht mark in June, dragged down by the steep plunge
of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
At the close of Asian spot trading on Tuesday, the dollar stood
at 42.2 baht, a drop of 38.7 percent since the currency peg was
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting skepticism and growing pains, Thailand has
reasons to be proud of its performance in dealing with the crisis.
At least, Thailand, unlike Indonesia, has enjoyed a relatively
stable political situation since the coalition government led by
Chuan took office late last year. Such political stability enables
the government to concentrate on implementing its reform policies.
</P>
<P>
As required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Thailand
embarked on the bumpy road of reform one year ago, adopting a
restrictive, albeit subsequently more cautions fiscal and monetary
policy to reduce the demand pressure and restore confidence in the
currency. Moreover, Thailand took a major step in carrying out an
institutional reform, including the Bank of Thailand
restructuring, a banking system overhaul, state enterprise
privatization and legal system modification to clear the way for
an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
After "swallowing" the IMF-prescribed "bitter pills," Thailand
has made gains and suffered losses at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The once-fragile financial system has been strengthened since
the government closed down 56 poorly-run financial firms and took
over seven debt-ridden banking institutions. A tight monetary
system and high interest rates have also restrained financial
institutions from issuing non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been stabilized within the 40-42 limit, living to
the government's expectation of preventing the currency from
drastic falls in the first half of 1998. Also, improvement in the
financial sector has helped restore foreign investment confidence,
drawing back part of the foreign capital that had flowed out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The government's performance has pleased the IMF, which
prescribed remedies for Thailand's ailing economy. Successful
cooperation between the two sides has led to the conclusion of
four letters of intent, through which batches of IMF aid is
provided to the country. Such aid has eased the economic hardships
to a certain extent.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Attract Tourists in Open Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is starting preparations to
attract more tourists to the country in the forthcoming open
season from October to April in an effort to develop its tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Myanmar's Tourism Development Management
Committee here Wednesday, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, urged
remedial measures to prepare for the best conditions in the
tourist season after the country received a low number of visitors
in the past years, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the public suffered great losses since the number of
tourists was not up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
A Visit Myanmar Year campaign was launched at the end of 1996
to get more tourists to the country.
</P>
<P>
A great deal of local and foreign investors established hotels,
motels and inns and travel and tourism services with a huge amount
of capital for the tourist year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 251,500 tourists
visited Myanmar in the 1996-97 fiscal year and 190,580 in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of 1997, the number of private-run hotels and
inns stood at 548, that of tourism agencies 622, passenger
transport services 1,620 and tourist guides 2,763, the statistics
showed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the country's hotels and tourism sector
exceeded 1 billion U.S. dollars in March, the end of the 1997-98
fiscal year, in more than 40 related projects out of the total
foreign investment of 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in tourist attractions such as recreation
sites, scenic beaches, natural forest resorts, sites rich in
cultural heritage, traditions and customs of nationalities and
other places of interest.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Decide on Accord With U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
actively considering signing the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
with the United States and will take a decision in this regard
soon, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury
said.
</P>
<P>
"Signing of the SOFA is under consideration. The draft is still
under study," a report in Thursday's edition of The Daily Star
newspaper quoted the state minister as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to take a decision. We have neither said yes nor
no," a high official with the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka is expected to proceed with the signing of the agreement
after the Foreign and Defense Ministries receive clarification
from the U.S. side, the report said, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would provide legal cover to the movement of U.S.
Armed Forces personnel, military hardware and supplies in times of
emergency in the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said Bangladesh
would "go ahead with our own thinking," denying allegations that
India was pressurizing Bangladesh not to sign the SOFA. Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a brief visit to India in mid-June,
reportedly to seek India's consent to the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the U.S. Embassy here said on
Wednesday that negotiations on the SOFA "are still going on"
between Bangladesh and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting a positive response from the Bangladesh
government in respect of signing the Status of Forces Agreement
between the government of Bangladesh and the U.S.A.," U.S.
Ambassador to Bangladesh John C. Holzman said on Tuesday in
Sylhet, Northwest Bangladesh, according to the report.

conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Takemitsu is among members of the Japanese National Association
for Reparations to Victims of Biological Warfare, who were touring
North America to seek support for cases on behalf of victims of
Japan's World War II biological warfare Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
"In 1935, 731 army was established by an order of Emperor
Hirohito in Pingfang, Harbin. It was called Department of
Epidemic Prevention," Takemitsu said.
</P>
<P>
He said as a student of the Manshu Medical School he
experienced events with 731 army after 1939. It was said that the
experiment of typhus vaccine was on monkeys in bacteriological
course, but later "I heard that monkeys were Chinese people and
they vivisected them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Takemitsu said he participated in the bacteriological warfare
in 1940 at Xinjing as a student of Manshu Medical School and
worked for prevention of epidemic as there was an outbreak of
plague near a pet's hospital. But "later it became clear that
Ishii unit (731) brought in the plague to that pet's hospital."
</P>
<P>
"In 1940 at Ningbo, in 1941 at Jinhua, in 1942 at Changde,
Ishii unit operated bacteriological warfare," he said. "Commander
Ishii Shiro proclaimed that 731 army had already established the
method of bacteriological warfare with plague to the General Staff
Office in 1941."
</P>
<P>
Two eyewitness statements were read at the press conference for
Shiro Azuma, a Japanese soldier who participated in the Tape of
Nanking in 1937, and Yoshio Shinozuka, who committed atrocities as
part of Unit 731. The two men planned to participate in person,
but were denied entry to the U.S. because of their war crimes.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Shinozuka said, Unit 731 carried out
experiments on human beings in China under a name of Water
Sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"I participated in the mass production of pathogenic germs from
July 1939 onwards and in the beginning of August, delivered the
same to Jiang Jun Xiao of the frontlines of Nomonhan," He said.
And the germs were flung into Rivers.
</P>
<P>
"The group I belonged to also carried out experimentation on
and dissection of living human beings. I personally participated
in the testing of the potency of plague germs for one year from
the end of 1942," He said.
</P>
<P>
"We infected five Chinese men with plague germs. Not only did
we watch them suffer from horrible pain, but also watched them die
an agonizing death," Shinozuka said.
</P>
<P>
On the Rape of Nanjing, Shino Azuma said, "our tactics was to
invade and plunder. We looked for food. If women in hide were
found, we rape them."
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Diana Zuckerman with the
Institute for Women's Policy Research and Gregory Rodriquez,
biological experiment victim's son, urged the U.S. government and
the Japanese government to make public the records on biological
warfare during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Dong Woo Lee Hahm, Washington Coalition for Comfort Women
Issues, and Melvin Rosen, survivor of Death March and Japanese
prison camp, also denounced Japanese criminal activities during
the War and demanded the Japanese government to apology for the
atrocities committed by the Japanese aggressors before and during
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Sticks to Barring Additional Incentives for Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign companies in Bulgaria have no
grounds to claim that they are not familiar with the Bulgarian
laws, as Bulgarian regulations are analogous to those in Western
Europe, a Bulgarian official told a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by Nikolai Pavlov, chairman of the
Commission for the Protection of Competition (CPC), was prompted
by the insistence of Shell-Bulgaria to revoke an amendment to the
law on the protection of competition under which foreign companies
operating on Bulgarian territory do not have the right to promote
their products through games of chance.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian parliament adopted the amendment a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Dimiter Kyumyurdjiev, a CPC member, said the legislations of EU
countries, the U.S. and Japan all bar giving additional incentives
in the form of prizes which exceed by far the price of the
commodity or service offered by the respective company.
</P>
<P>
He stated that such provisions have also been adopted by
Germany, France, the Netherlands and others, where companies like
Shell, Danone, Procter &AMP; Gamble and American Tobacco are seated.
</P>
<P>
These companies are fussing in the media against the Bulgarian
legislation, ignoring the fact that it is in conformity with
Western ones, Kyumyurdjiev added.
</P>
<P>
Shell company said although this provision was in line with
European legislation, the social and economic conditions in
Bulgaria are not suitable to apply European standards.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of other foreign companies raised similar
demands as Shell's.

China and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
His plane is the first aircraft to take off from the new Hong

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Opens Hong Kong New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Thursday opened the new Hong Kong International Airport, a
multi-billion-dollar project that took eight years to build for
the aviation growth into the next century.
</P>
<P>
At a grand opening ceremony Thursday morning, Jiang unveiled a
commemorative plaque before a crowd of more than 3,000 guests
clustering in the passenger terminal, a Y-shaped building claimed
to be the world's most spacious airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is constructed on a 1,248-hectare reclaimed
site at Chek Lap Kok off the northern coast of Lantau Island, 25
kilometers west of the Hong Kong Island. Operating around the
clock, the airport has a designed capacity of handling 35 million
passengers and three million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
"The new international airport is one of the most advanced
airports in today's world," said Vice-Premier Qian Qichen at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the opening of the new airport would not only
give a tremendous impetus to the exchanges between Hong Kong and
the mainland, and between Hong Kong and other parts of the world,
but would also help consolidate Hong Kong's status as an
international or regional center of finance, trade, aviation and
tourism, enhance its competitiveness, and inject new vitality to
the economic development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said on the same occasion: "The grand
opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport is a
combination of the wisdom, diligence and entrepreneurship of the
Hong Kong people and symbolizes the brilliant prospects of Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
The new airport is part of the ten infrastructure projects
collectively known as the Airport Core Program, one of the biggest
civil engineering undertakings in the world, built at a cost of
155 billion HK dollars (20 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The new airport is an amazing engineering project, in which
everyone in Hong Kong takes pride," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of the new airport, the SAR government
will invest 235 billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars) in
the five years to come on a package of large-scale infrastructure
projects, according to the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "These massive projects bear further testimony to
the ability and determination of the people of Hong Kong. They
once again prove that Hong Kong will always be a city of vigor and
opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Wong Po-yan, Chairman of the Airport Authority (AA), spoke
highly of the hard work in the construction of the new airport by
local communities, companies from the mainland and over 25 foreign
countries. The AA is a statutory body primarily responsible for
the designing, construction and management of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
A variety of cultural and entertainment programs were staged at
the three-hour-long opening gala, including a dancing dragon
formed by 500 people, a lion dance, a children's choir,
instrumental music, and a video show.
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at the opening ceremony were senior central
government officials, principal officials of the SAR, foreign
government representatives, chairmen of other airport authorities,
and those involved in the new airport construction and operation.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be opened for commercial aviation on July
6 after a dramatic overnight move of airport operations from Kai
Tak to Chek Lap Kok.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Financial Crisis to Persist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More and more economists have predicted recently that the Asian
economy is likely to decline by 0.1 to 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The persistence of the Asian crisis should also be attributed
to the Japanese economic recession and a weak yen in particular.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Japan's GDP fell by an annualized
5.3 percent in the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter
of decline.
</P>
<P>
The economic recession in Japan is reducing demand for Asian
products, hurting exports of countries in the region. In April,
Japan's imports from members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations fell by 26 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But a weak yen is a more serious disaster for other Asian
countries. The cheaper Japanese exports resulting from a weaker
yen, which tumbled nearly to 147 against the U.S. dollar on June
15, have threatened exports growth in Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and South Korea. These countries had hoped that their
currency slump in the past year could boost their own exports and
fuel recovery.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many analysts fear that a tumbling yen would cut
Japanese bank loans to other Asian countries, which are badly in
need of funds to reactivate their economies.
</P>
<P>
Japanese bank loans outstanding to Asia stood at 249 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of 1997, a third of total foreign lending
to the region. As most of the loans are denominated in dollars,
the further depreciation of the yen will mean more losses to
Japanese banks. Accordingly, Japanese banks would reduce their
loans to Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Asian currencies enjoyed a respite Wednesday, on
the eve of the first anniversary of the start of the regional
financial crisis, as the yen stayed firm on positive expectations
for the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The yen surged to above 138 to the dollar from 140.45 on the
previous day, partly due to the tax cut reports and also because
of continued cautious optimism about a plan to clean up the
Japanese banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday that
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had decided to implement
permanent income and residence tax cuts and a plan would be
announced before the July 12 upper house elections.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the
yen's trend.
</P>
<P>
Another important cause of the persisting crisis is the
strengthening of economic globalization, under which an isolated
political and economic incident in a country would bring about a
chain of negative effects on the regional, or even the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Since its outbreak a year ago, the crisis has gone from bad to
worse owing to the social unrest in Thailand, South Korea and
Indonesia and the nuclear tests in India and Pakistan, further
delaying the regional economic recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that since a lot of economic and political
uncertainties still remain in Asia, the financial crisis may
continue to hurt the region in the months ahead.

KUNMING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- At a cost of approximately 500

southwest China's Yunnan Province, recently completed four road
projects that largely improved the city's traffic conditions.

By the end of 1997, Kunming had some 900 km of streets and

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- One year after its eruption, the
Asian currency crisis is showing no signs of abating and an Asian
turnaround may still take some time as the crisis seems deepening.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, 1997, the floating of the Thai baht triggered a
currency turmoil first in Southeast Asia and then in South Korea.
The whole Asian region and even the rest of the world have felt
the severe impact of the crisis since then.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the affected countries have done their
best to ease the crisis by undertaking economic adjustments and
financial reforms. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank have provided billions of dollars
to bail out the economies of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, the crisis seems persisting and even deepening with
continuous declines of currencies, slowdown of economic growth,
rising inflation, closures of banks and companies and massive
layoffs in the crisis-hit nations and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Some Asian currencies, in the meantime, are dropping to the
level of January when the crisis entered a deteriorating phase.
</P>
<P>
Why is the one-year-old crisis lingering on?
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that as the Asian economy is facing a
possible recession this year, the worsening situation may postpone
economic reforms in the region and as a result, the current crisis
may last longer than most people have expected.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the economies of Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea registered negative growth
while the Singapore economy showed signs of a possible recession.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, considered the least-affected by the
crisis, the gross domestic product (GDP) achieved a mere
1.7-percent growth in the first quarter, much lower than the 5.1
percent registered a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Philippines' export increased only by 9.8
percent, compared with the average 23 percent in the first three
months of the year, and its unemployment rate rose to 13 percent,
the highest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that with the full-blown impact of the crisis on
their economies, Asian countries may experience the most difficult
time in two decades this year.

<HEADLINE> Snub-Nosed Monkeys Discovered In Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists have found more
than 1,000 snub-nosed monkeys in China's southwest Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
These Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys were found in the Samagong
forest area in Weixi County, over 3,500 meters above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys were previously thought to mainly
live in the Baimang (Whiteness) Snow Mountain state nature
reserve, over 3,800 meters above sea level and more than 200 km
away from Samagong forest area, which is in the northwestern part
of the province.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey is a rare species that has been

protection in China.
</P>
<P>
The monkeys substitute on a diet of fruits and leaves. They
are snow white when they are young and their backs turn black as
they grow.
</P>
<P>
The Samagong Forest is a primeval area of some 50,000 hectares
of land between the upper reaches of the Jinsha and Lancang

<HEADLINE> China's Second Largest Copper Mine Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Investment Company of Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has decided to join three other businesses
in building China's second largest copper mine, after the Dexing
Copper Mine in Jiangxi Province, at a cost of 800 million yuan (96
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ore at the Ashele Copper Mine, in Xinjiang's Habahe County,
was first discovered in the late 1980s. In the intervening years,
44.38 million tons of ore that contained more than a million tons
of copper and large amounts of zinc, gold, silver, and pyrite have
been dug out.
</P>
<P>
According to a new plan, the mine will be designed for a daily
production of 3,000 tons of ores, capable of producing annually
100,000 tons of copper concentrate, 20,000 tons of zinc
concentrate, and 870,000 tons of sulphur concentrate.
</P>
<P>
Drilling and pit projects have been completed and China's
second largest mine is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts predict that China will need 1.3 million tons
of copper annually, but domestic supplies can account for
two-thirds of that amount, so the new copper mine is expected to
resolve this problem to some extent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Cut Maximum Weight of Rice Sack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry has approved a regulation to cut the maximum weight of a
rice sack from 100 to 55 kilograms in an effort to entice Thais to
take jobs to be vacated by foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper The Bangkok Post Thursday quoted the ministry as
saying the measure is in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The approval came after 400 rice millers decided to suspend
operations and halt paddy purchases from Thursday in protest
against a ban on alien labor from July 10. They say Thais are
unwilling to take jobs in the industry, which is short of an
estimated 200,000 laborers.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, a male worker can carry a sack of no more
than 55 kilograms and a female 30 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of foreign workers is part of the Thai
government's efforts to alleviate the mounting problem of domestic
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Labor Ministry, the number of jobless people
in Thailand has reached 2 million.

<P>
ROME, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Trade Minister Augusto
Fantozzi is to lead a delegation of Italian industrialists to
South Korea in October to boost cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It was seen as one of the most significant results so far from
South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Park Tae Young's
ongoing visit to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Park is in Rome for a conference sponsored by the Association
for Cultural and Economic Relations between Italy and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Italy is South Korea's third largest trade partner in Europe
and the first European country targeted by South Korea's President
Kim Dae-Jung as part of a new economic policy aimed at pulling the
country out of its year-long economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since Kim Dae-Jung came to power in February, the new
administration has been "engaged in a strong program of economic
liberalization", Park said at the conference on Wednesday, adding
that he hoped Italy would be "increasingly present with industrial
investments".
</P>
<P>
Italian Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Antonio Cabras said at
the conference that Italy was following the efforts being made by
the new South Korean government "with great interest."

<HEADLINE> Strong Facsimile Market in U.S. Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Americans continue to look to
fax machines for sending documents despite the growing popularity
of e-mail, according to a California-based market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
The country's facsimile revenue is projected to reach three
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, up 17.7 percent from 1997 revenue of
2.6 billion dollars, reported Dataquest, part of the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said in a new report that the number of facsimile
compatible devices sold would grow from 5.5 million units in 1998
to 7.5 million units by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Personal or low-end products, which include multifunctional and
single-function fax machines, grew 81 percent from 1.6 million
units in 1996 to 2.9 million 1997, according to Dataquest. This
represented a 44 percent increase in terms of revenue.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest predicts continued robust growth in the low-end
market as color-printing and laser multifunctional products ride
the uptake of PCs in homes, home offices and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The workgroup market including mid-range and high-end products
experienced no growth from 1996 to 1997, with sales in both years
of 525,000 units. Dataquest predicted that sales of these products
would generate 5.7 billion dollars in cumulative hardware sales
revenue from 1998 to 2002, and 17 billion dollars if adding
service and supply revenues.

</P>
<P>

the international community and push all the parties involved in
the conflict to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the ethnic Albanians and the Serbian

<P>
The Albanian foreign minister stressed that assurances of
stopping attacks on innocent civilians must be made before the

</P>
<P>
Milo said that if the planned talks broke up, then NATO would
have to consider taking military measures, including options such

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Massive Rice Market Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
launched a massive market operation to help millions of poor
families across the country deal with the economic crisis, leading
local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which was announced Wednesday by chief of the
National Logistics Agency (Bulog), Beddu Amang, is aimed at poor
people most vulnerable to food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government will provide medium quality
rice at 1,000 rupiah per kilogram to families whose earnings are
insufficient to bring them out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The rice prices in the market is 2,500 to 3,200 rupiah per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Amang said that on the first stage, the operation will cover
179,000 poor families in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, and the
its surrounding areas such as Bogor, Tangerang and Bakasi.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, he said, this will be extended to cover
1.6 million poor families in 53 districts in 15 provinces and in
the third stage, it will cover a total of 7.35 million needy
families in this country of more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Food and Horticulture Minister AM Saefuddin said a
special team will be set up to run the market operation.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought and deteriorating economic conditions
over the past year have combined to increase the number of people
deemed as vulnerable to food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Thailand Reaches 10.7 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Thailand in June
remained in double digits for the third consecutive month, rising
10.7 percent year-on-year, the newspaper The Nation reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rate was 10.2 percent in May and 10.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry attributed the bigger rise in June
to a 13.6-percent increase in food and beverage prices and an
8.8-percent price rise in the non-food sector.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index for the first six months of this year
was 9.7 percent, with prices up 11.8 percent in the food sector
and 8.4 percent for non-food items.
</P>
<P>
Though prices have gone up to reflect rising production costs,
most manufacturers have been making a good effort to hold the line
on prices, Karun Kittisataporn, director-general of the Business
Economics Department, said.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the wholesale price index in June
rose by 20.7 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Karun acknowledged that the inflation rate over the past few
months was the highest since 1981, when a fuel crisis pushed the
rate to 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said his department expected that the rate for the year
would be below the 10.5-percent figure projected by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Karun forecast a drop in the inflation rate in August as prices
and costs stabilized.

<HEADLINE> Basic Facts About HK New Airport at Chek Lap Kok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will officiate at a grand opening of the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok this morning. Here are some
basic facts about the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The airport is located 25 kilometers west of Hong Kong's
Central business district.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 1,248 hectares, the new airport is almost
four times the size of the existing airport at Kai Tak. The
airport platform was formed by leveling the tiny islands of Chek
Lap Kok and Lam Chau and reclaiming land from the sea.
</P>
<P>
When it opens for commercial operation on July 6, the first of
its two 3,800-meter-long runways will be in service. The new
airport will operate round the clock without the night-time flight
restrictions imposed at the existing airport at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be able to handle 35 million passengers
and 3 million tons of cargo annually compared with the 28.3
million passengers and 1.79 million tons of cargo that passed
through Kai Tak in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The second runway will be commissioned by the end of 1998. The
airport will be developed in phases and ultimately is expected to
handle 87 million passengers and 9 million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
The new Hong Kong International Airport is one of the ten
infrastructure projects known collectively as the Airport Core
Program. These developments include 34 kilometers of expressways
and tunnels, a high-speed rail link that will carry passengers
between the Central business district on Hong Kong Island and the
new airport in just 23 minutes, a third-crossing harbor tunnel and
a new town development. The total estimated cost of the entire
program is 155.3 billion HK dollars (19.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Y-shaped airport passenger terminal, covering a floor space
of 515,000 square meters upon opening and 550,000 square meters by
the end of 1998, ranks among the world's largest terminals. Signs
posting throughout the terminal are clear and simple.
</P>
<P>
There are 38 bridge-served gates for wide-bodied aircraft (48
by the end of 1998) and 27 hard-stand gates. Accessibility to the
bridge-served gates will be facilitated by a driverless shuttle
train and moving walkways.
</P>
<P>
Departing passengers should take less than three minutes to
check in at nearly 300 desks. From each of these desks, as well as
16 over-sized luggage check-in counters, luggage will move
smoothly on its way through a sophisticated luggage handling and
screening system, so the highest levels of security will be
maintained. It should take no more than 30 minutes to complete
check-in and immigration formalities to board aircraft.
</P>
<P>
With 12 reclaim carousels handling almost 20,000 pieces of
luggage an hour, passengers may claim their luggage quickly after
entering the arrivals area.

<HEADLINE> Coastal City Cultivating Marine Fishery Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Dandong City, the northeastern
starting point of China's coastline, has taken steps to cultivate
its marine fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
Dandong, which sits at the estuary of the Yalu River into the
Yellow Sea, has a coast of 93.3 kilometers and its offshore waters
are home to more than 70 kinds of fish. It is one of China's
well-known marine fishing ground.
</P>
<P>
A decline of the marine fishery resources in the offshore areas
has been reported as a result of over-fishing. Beginning in 1986,
Dandong has been sending fry into the offshore areas of the Yellow
Sea, including 4.57 billion head of baby prawns, 8.25 million of
young chum salmon and 750 million jellyfish fry in an effort to
restore fishing resources.
</P>
<P>
The effort has shown economic results. The city has harvested
1,600 tons of prawns and farmers have earned 55 million yuan from
prawn fishing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, output value of sea-based aquatic products reached
2.4 billion yuan, five times the 1985 level and contributed 15.8
percent of the city's gross domestic product for 1997, according
to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP to Decline: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's gross domestic product
(GDP) is predicted to decline by more than 10 percent this year
due to the slowing down of the country's economy and the lack of
confidence in the business sector, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
"But the decline in economic activities is believed to stop as
economic programs are carried out while confidence of economic
players is restored," Coordinating Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita told a limited cabinet meeting
on economic, financial and industrial affairs here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the meeting, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah
told reporters that Ginandjar predicted that the inflation rate in
the 1998 fiscal year will reach 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on the rate during the first semester
of this year, Yunus was quoted by the local press Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the inflation rate in the country was
expected to be 46.55 percent and the biggest contributors to the
inflation during June were food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting said the government would take special
steps to maintain the 1998-99 budget at normal level, according to
Yunus.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget deficit could not be continually maintained
although it is acceptable to the country which is going through
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the ratio of the budget deficit to the GDP will be
decreasing in the 1999-2000 fiscal year," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nazi War Criminal to Stay Under House Arrest in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 1 (Xinhua) -- An Italian appeal court ruled on
Wednesday that convicted Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who is
now 86, is to remain under house arrest in an apartment in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Judge Renato Teresi of the Rome Court of Cassation turned down
a defense request for Priebke's release from house detention and
ruled that the former SS captain would stay under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Priebke and fellow Nazi officer Karl Hass were sentenced on
March 7 to life imprisonment by a Rome Military Appeal Court for
their part in the Fosse Ardeatine massacre on March 24, 1944.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, seven months after his re-trial for the

<P>
COLOMBO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has received a grant of
15 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank to convert primary
schools into junior schools, Education Ministry sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conversion is being done on the recommendations of the
Presidential Task Force on General Education Reforms. It will seek
to ensure that education is compulsory for children in the 5 to 14
age group.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this will help rationalize and uplift the more
disadvantaged segment of the country's school system in the
initial phase of restructuring education.
</P>
<P>
A school mapping process is already in progress and a
comprehensive survey to identify and collect information on
schools will also be undertaken soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Institute of Education is developing a
framework to introduce a system of school-based management. This

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Families Buy More Durable Consumers Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The average ownership of household
durable consumer goods has increased considerably in this
financial and economic center of China.
</P>
<P>
The per capita annual disposal income of Shanghai residents
exceeded 8,400 yuan last year, 3.4 times the 1991 figure,
according to an official survey. In another measurement, the
increase has averaged 22.6 percent each year during the period.
</P>
<P>
Most families with rising incomes have turned to high-grade
durable goods for spending. The survey shows that for every 100
Shanghai households there are an average 119 color TVs and 102
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, household ownership of air conditioners has
surged, from an average of 0.4 units in 1991 to 62 last year. The
ownership of video recorders, washing machines and water heaters
is also steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
Luxury durables such as pianos and personal computers have also
made their way into ordinary Shanghai households. Another survey
of more than 1,300 students indicates that 10 percent of the
student families have purchased computers, with another 50 percent
planning to buy one.
</P>
<P>
Many households in Shanghai have begun replacing durable goods
bought in the 1980s with more advanced ones with a higher level of
technical content. They now prefer large-screen color TVs and
super-large, freon-free refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that Shanghai residents have become more
rational in their decisions to purchase durable goods and the
average household ownership of durables, especially large-screen
color TVs and personal computers, is expected to rise steadily.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Foreign Exchange Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange reserves of
Bank Indonesia (BI) increased by 7.6 million U.S. dollars last
week, the local press Thursday quoted a BI press statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's foreign exchange reserves jumped to 14.6095
billion dollars on June 26 from 14.6019 billion dollars on June
19, the first rise during the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
BI said the increase in the reserves mainly came from oil and
gas exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BI's claim on the Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRA) slightly declined to 132.34 trillion rupiah (about
13.2 billion dollars) on June 26 from 133.28 trillion rupiah on
June 19.
</P>
<P>
The decline was because banks under the supervision of IBRA had
settled part of their liquidity credit injected by the central
bank, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
BI has been injecting credit liquidity to troubled banks while
IBRA has the responsibility for recovering the loans.

<P>
BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said here Wednesday that the persistence with the
idea of independence for Kosovo could spark a new war across the
whole region.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Romanian counterpart
Andrei Plesu, Dini said larger autonomy for the Serbian province
of Kosovo was the only way to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian authorities had already hinted that they would
accept the proposal, but the international community should put
further pressure on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and the Albanian
authorities to make them understand that persisting with the idea
of independence could trigger a war, said Dini.
</P>
<P>
Plesu said it was possible to solve the Kosovo crisis through
political means, adding that the Balkan countries should
strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed that it was imperative for their
two countries to further cooperation in all fields and renew joint
projects within the framework of the strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Dini also said Italy would continue to back Romania's accession
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister said he was optimistic that
Romania and Slovakia would join NATO in the bloc's second wave of
expansion.

NANJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China has encouraged its 18,000
counties and townships nationwide to improve the quality of their
environment and the health level of their residents, according to
a recent national conference on the establishment of state health
townships.
</P>
<P>
During the conference held in Suzhou, a city in east China's
Jiangsu Province, the first group of such state health townships
includes Tangqiao Township in Jiangsu, and Xin'an and Shanlan
townships, both in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Liquan County in Xianyang City of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province has been named China's first "state health county."
</P>
<P>
Residents of these townships and county have good natural
environments and are generally healthy, one official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that, about eight years ago, more than 600 Chinese
cities joined the contest to establish state health cities and
some 29 cities nationwide have been named as "state health cities"
and some 100 cities have been named as "provincial level health
cities."
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that the environmental quality of
townships is of great importance as the dominant part of Chinese
peasants living in small-size townships.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on township governments across the
country to strengthen health education for peasants and to improve
air quality, water quality, road conditions, waste disposal and
the hygienic situation of toilets.

reduce its projected 40-billion-peso (1 billion dollars) budget
deficit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty forms part of a multi-point tax program for which
legislative support will be sought by the administration when the
congress reopens on July 27, the newspaper The Philippine Journal
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tax measures are intended to help erase the hefty deficit
in the budget by yearend triggered mainly by the financial crisis
and the decreasing tax collection, Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the tax amnesty plan, which has been opposed by
the International Monetary Fund, would hardly hit the low-income
group and other marginalized sectors.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at going after the idle rich, the affluent
members of the underground economy by encouraging them to come out
into the open with hidden and unused assets, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The plan is presently being worked out by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue and former Senator Edgardo Angara for
presentation to the congress when it reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
Measures are also being drawn up to encourage those who refuse
to pay taxes to the government or those who hide or understate
their assets to comply with existing tax regulations.
</P>
<P>
The government's financial position has been deteriorating this
year due to the prolonged financial crisis which began to plague
the country in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government, which has enjoyed budget surplus yearly during
the past four years, posted a 15.4-billion-peso (390 million
dollars) budget deficit for the first five months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Rich Urged to Help Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's rich people have been urged
to contribute to the country's help-the-poor drive, which aims to
eliminate poverty in the country by the year 2000, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This was the theme of an international forum on the role of the
private sector in poverty alleviation through social efforts and
balanced regional development, which opened in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the United Nations Center for
Regional Development, the Development Research Center of China's
State Council and the China Brilliant Cause Promotional Commission.
</P>
<P>
There are at present 50 million people in China with an annual
income below 630 yuan (79.5 US dollars) which means they cannot
afford sufficient food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank counts those who earn less than one dollar per
day as poor, and one third of China's 900 million farmers fall
into this category, said You Hongbing, deputy secretary-general
of the Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions in China.
</P>
<P>
The forum encourages enterprises' participation in regional
development and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
People are getting richer. Savings deposits have increased from
21 billion yuan (2.52 billion US dollars) in 1978 to the current
5,000 billion yuan (600 billion US dollars). But is is not a
balanced growth, You said.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the money comes from urban residents, who make up
25 percent of the population. And one-third of rural deposits
comes from farmers living in coastal regions.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Enter Labor Waiting Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The third NBA players lockout in
four years went into effect early today.
</P>
<P>
Owners imposed the lockout after they were unable to reach a
new collective bargaining agreement with the players association
in the past three months. It means teams cannot transact any
business involving players.
</P>
<P>
They can't sign free agents, make trades, conduct training
camps or sign players selected in the draft last week. Michael
Olowokandi, selected No. 1 by the Clippers, returned to his home
in England to wait out the dispute.
</P>
<P>
They can, however, sign coaches, meaning Chicago, Clippers and
Denver can fill their vacancies.
</P>
<P>
League and union representatives have met nine times since
April 1 but made no progress. Future talks haven't been scheduled,
and none are expected until mid-July after union player
representatives meet in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
The NBA players union is considering staging a series of
exhibition games this summer to generate revenue for its members
during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a lot of offers over a period of time," union
first vice president Charles Smith said. "We have explored some
opportunities. It's someting you have to look at it if this is an
additional revenue steam for players."
</P>
<P>
Union executive director Billy Hunter has said that when
polled, 90 percent of union membership said they were prepared to
stay out the entire season and would not need financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time players have been locked out in the past
four years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Cease-Fire Before Serb Pullback in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
eased its demand for an immediate withdrawal of Serb forces in
Kosovo, stressing there should be a cease-fire first before the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is holding to the demands for a
withdrawal of the Serb forces, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said Wednesday, adding the American diplomats are trying to
arrange a cease-fire first.
</P>
<P>
That may ensure that ethnic Albanian fighters do not seize the
opportunity of a troop withdrawal to rush in to fill the vacuum
and gain more territory in Kosovo, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, we don't expect to see that kind of
pullback in the absence of a cease-fire. That doesn't mean we
wouldn't prefer to see it without a cease-fire, but as a practical
matter that, in our view, is the most likely sequence," he added.
</P>
<P>
The shift was the second major move by the administration in
the past week to try to revitalize its diplomatic approach to the
conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rubin said the dialogue between the ethnic Albanian
leadership and Belgrade should be open to the armed Albanian
insurgents who had been denounced previously as acting like
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The contacts are expected to intensify next week when U.S.
mediator Robert Gelbard goes to Europe for a meeting with German,
British, French, Russian and Italian diplomats in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard and other American diplomats are proposing a seat at
the table for the Kosovo Liberation Army alongside Ibrahim Rugova,
the pacifist moderate who many ethnic Albanians look to as their
leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin reiterated that the Serbs are primarily to blame
for the bloodshed in the southern province and that the United
States has the authority to use force to halt the fighting if
diplomacy fails.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Deliveries Up in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Boeing delivered 139 airplanes
in the second quarter this year, up from 108 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Altogether the Seattle-based manufacturer has delivered 247
airplanes for the first half of 1998, slightly short of its goal
of 250.
</P>
<P>
The company said Wednesday that a growing number of planes is
being completed but then put in storage. Financial problems for
Asian airlines have led to storage of 19 completed airplanes, up
from eight at the beginning of the year. Boeing expects to deliver
these jets by year-end, some possibly to different customers than
those ordering them.
</P>
<P>
Boeing still plans to deliver 550 jetliners this year, but it
will have to continue increasing its delivery pace through the
rest of the year to meet that target. Over the past six months the
company has been taking measures to streamline and accelerate
production.
</P>
<P>
"Our main issues now are production efficiencies, getting ready
for the next rate increase on the 737 (to 21 a month from 14) and
working aggressively to reduce our overall cost structure," the
company said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation of State Securities Deepens Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in the
Republic of Moldova is made even more worse by a related
phenomenon, inflation of the government securities, National Bank
governor Leonid Talmaci told a recent meeting with businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The state has issued securities in such a great number that the
internal debt represents just two thirds of the monetary mass in
circulation, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation of securities, he said, is expressed in high
interest. In the first half of this year, the interest rate of the
most sought securities rose from 27 up to 35 percent, while the
inflation in the same period increased just 2.54 percent and the
refinancing rate for credits was between 16 and 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
To convince the public to purchase more securities, the
government raises the interest, said Talmaci.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May the securities market was shaken by first
alarming signals: the reimbursement exceeded the real income from
the new sales. In June the Finance Ministry repaid securities of
144 million lei (30.64 million U.S. dollars), while the revenue
from the new issuances soared to only 98.3 million lei (20.9
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Conceived and presented as an uninflational source of recovery
of the deficit, the government securities have become something
that generates new internal debts. The state spends increasingly
more money to repay the treasury bonds, Deputy Premier and
Economics Minister Ion Sturza told journalists.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the internal debt rose 1.7-fold and the cost of
recovery two-fold. This year the Finance Ministry repaid interests
of 57.5 million lei (12.23 million dollars) to securities holders.
</P>
<P>
The pyramid of securities, built by the government to cover the
budgetary deficit, is now trembling. Some experts think that the
next months the ministry may confront face to face the problem of
securities repayment.
</P>
<P>
Investors with serious business intentions are leaving the
Moldovan market. If a year ago some 50 percent of all treasury
bonds were purchased by foreigners, now they demand only 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the collapse of the securities pyramid, the government
is planning to issue more and more securities. Last year the
Finance Ministry sold securities of 1.28 billion lei (272.34
million dollars) plus another package of 773.4 million lei (164.55
dollars) in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Premier Ion Sturza, these conditions should
make the government cut down the mass of loans on the internal
market and, on the other hand, cut down the interest.

Internal loans, he said, are now even more expensive than the
foreign credits. Finance Ministry experts believe that the
interest rate of securities should be reduced unless it fits the
real growth in economics.
</P>
<P>
However, no viable mechanism has been applied so far to
diminish the negative effects of the securities inflation and
their costs are constantly rising.

NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rallied into
the close Wednesday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to
its first finish above 9,000 in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Dow jumped 96.65 to 9,048.67 after nearly faltering for the
fifth straight session in a bid to hold above 9,000.
</P>
<P>
The barometer of 30 big companies has risen in six of the past
seven sessions, gaining 337 points, and now sits just 163 points
shy of May 13's record close of 9,211.84. The Dow's last finish
above 9,000 was on June 9.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also rallied over the final hour after
posting modest gains for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 14.72 to 1,148.56, topping
Monday's high of 1,138.49. It closed at a new high for the fourth
time in six sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite rose 19.72 to 1,914.46, just shy of its
all-time best finish of 1,917.61 set on April 22 and the first
close above 1,900 since that record was set. The Nasdaq has surged
nearly 12 percent over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 682.79
million shares, down from 754.85 million on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index up 6.87 to 585.60, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.03 to 723.31.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.46 to
459.85.
</P>
<P>
The market opened strong amid news reports saying Japan's
leaders are set to propose sweeping tax cuts to stimulate the
sputtering Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The reports came as Federal Reserve officials were concluding a
two-day meeting with no change in the central bank's key lending
rates.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo share prices rallied 3.4 percent as a leading Japanese
newspaper reported that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto plans to
introduce permanent tax cuts of up to 4 trillion yen, or about 29
billion U.S. dollars, next year.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Impose New Tough Controls on Arms Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government Wednesday
published a draft legislation, setting out new plans on tightening
controls over arms exports.
</P>
<P>
The draft legislation, presented by British Trade and Industry
Secretary Margaret Beckett, would for the first time give
parliament the right to scrutinize changes to restrictions on
arms exports.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, any changes to government guidelines on
arms exports will not automatically go before parliament for
approval, but the parliament will be able to examine changes and
pass a resolution if it disagrees with them.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation is also expected to grant the Customs
authorities greater powers to investigate alleged breaches of
British arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said in a statement, "It is important in a modern
democracy for government to be accountable to parliament for the
way it uses its strategic export control powers."
</P>
<P>
Due to the coming summer recess of the parliament, the draft
legislation will not be presented to the parliament until this
autumn.

<HEADLINE> Diana Museum Opens to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About 2,500 people visited the last
resting place of Diana, Princess of Wales, as Althorp Park was
opened Wednesday for the first time since her death last August.
</P>
<P>
They came with flowers and cards to pay tribute to Diana on her
birthday and were eager to see her childhood home and resting
place.
</P>
<P>
Althorp House, the Spencer family's rural estate, flung open
its gates to welcome Diana fans and curious onlookers.
</P>
<P>
Visitors had their first glimpse of a new museum built in the
princess's memory and of the island on which she was buried.
</P>
<P>
From the early school reports to moving footage of her funeral,
the museum traced the life of the girl who became a princess and
touched the hearts of millions with her unique blend of glamor,
compassion and love-hate relationship with the media who pursued
her until death.
</P>
<P>
Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, greeted the visitors
with smiles and posed for photographs in the grounds of the house
which cynics have slammed as "Dianaville," but which the first
delighted tourists called tasteful and dignified.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people are expected to visit the
Northamptonshire house over the next two months.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports on Congo's Human Rights Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A report of the U.N.
secretary-general's aborted human rights investigative team in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday pointed to evidence
that killing in the country constituted crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
In a cover letter transmitting the report to the Security
Council, Secretary-General Kofi Annan highlighted the team's
conclusion that the killings by the Alliance of Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of the Congo (AFDL) constituted crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general decided to withdraw the team in April
because of the government's total lack of cooperation. The team
had gone in with a mandate to investigate violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law which were alleged to
have been committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo up to
December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the team members believe that some of
the killings may constitute genocide, depending on their intent,
and call for further investigation of those crimes and their
motivation.
</P>
<P>
The report stated that from mid-October to mid-November 1996,
the AFDL and elements of the Rwanda Army (RPA) attacked camps in
North and South Kivu containing refugees and, in most if not all
cases, military elements hostile to the government of Rwanda. The
team did not have sufficient information to draw any conclusions
about those attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in May 1997, hundreds of unarmed
Rwandan Hutus were massacred in Mbandaka and the neighboring
village of Wendji by AFDL troops apparently under effective RPA
command.
</P>
<P>
The report found possible evidence of genocide, noting that the
attacks on the camps in North Kivu in 1996 "reveal the intent to
eliminate those Rwandan Hutus who had remained in Zaire."
</P>
<P>
Among its recommendations, the report stated that if a new
investigative body is established, it should focus on massacres
occurring during inter-ethnic fighting in North and South Kivu
beginning in March 1993; serious violations of human rights
allegedly committed within the camps established in eastern Zaire
from July 1994 to October 1996; the extent of RPA involvement
since October 1996; the extent of foreign troops participation in
serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law during the
armed conflict; and the intent underlying the massacre of Rwandan
and Zairean Hutus beginning in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented in advance to the government of Rwanda
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kinshasa called the
report "a dangerous document that, contrary to the ideals of
international peace and security propagated by the United Nations,
exacerbates the ethnic hatred between Hutu and Tutsi by
oversimplifying the complex problems which plague the Great Lakes
region."
</P>
<P>
Kigali replied that the report was "emotive" and that it lacked
credible testimonies. "Publication of such an incomplete, biased
and totally misleading report does not serve the human rights
cause, and would compromise the possibility of getting to the
truth of what happened."

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The state's Republican Party of
Iowa in the United States has already scheduled a high-profile
straw poll of presidential candidates in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the race hasn't started yet, we thought we should

Fortmann, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party, was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fortmann said Republican officials will conduct an Iowa Straw
Poll on August 14, 1999, at Iowa State University in Ames. During

Iowa's precinct caucuses will mark the opening of the
presidential nominating season in 2000, and candidates are already
spending considerable time in the state.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the
yen Wednesday on continued optimism that Japan is finally ready to
make the steps needed to push up its recessionary economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the mark as Russian data released
Wednesday showed its economy is slipping further.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 138.07 yen,
down from 139.16 late Tuesday. The U.S. currency also was changing
hands at 1.8187 marks, up from 1.8080.
</P>
<P>
The latest news came Wednesday, when a Japanese newspaper
reported that the Japanese prime minister will introduce permanent
income and residential tax cuts of up to 29 million U.S. dollars
next year.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, top politicians are to reveal details about a
bridge bank that will help tidy up Japan's overwhelmed banking
system, which is slumping as Japan endures its worst recession
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday:
1.5285 Swiss francs, up from 1.5195; 6.0935 French francs, up from

<HEADLINE> Italian FM on NATO's Further Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO will persevere in its
open-door policy to all the applicant countries and Italy will
continue to support Romania and Slovenia in their bid to join NATO
quickly, said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who is on a one-day official visit in
Romania, said that NATO's enlargement had to be seen as a process
with no limitations set beforehand. "Italy is interested in a
second wave of NATO enlargement designed to fortify the alliance's
southern flank and wished it to start in 1999," Dini said at a
press conference, together with his Romanian counterpart Andrei
Plesu.
</P>
<P>
The Italian chief diplomat explained that Romania would be of
help in strengthening Europe and NATO, security and stability in
the region. He said that NATO's expansion itself and the date for
its start were uncertain, but "it is clear that Romania and
Slovenia are the prime countries to be admitted, as is stipulated
in the Madrid Declaration."
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said that it was too
early now to say something definite about the date of NATO's
further expansion but that it was important for Romania "to be
ready" when the process started.
</P>
<P>
As it was reported here, Italy and France are among the NATO
member countries which consistently supported and supports
Romania's bid to join the Euro-Atlantic structures.

<HEADLINE> Tax Charges Against Ex-Justice Official Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- In a major blow to Whitewater
prosecutors, a federal judge Wednesday dismissed the tax evasion
case against former Justice Department official and presidential
friend Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Robertson granted a defense request
to dismiss the charges because the case was built on evidence
Hubbell had turned over under a grant of limited immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision also means that all charges brought by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr against Hubbell's wife, Suzy,
his accountant and his tax lawyer will be dropped, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Robertson ruled that Starr "built his case against Mr. Hubbell
using 13,120 pages of records that Mr. Hubbell was compelled to
produce under subpoena."
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's use of the documents "violates the immunity
given to Mr. Hubbell" by a federal judge in Arkansas, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell turned over his personal tax documents to Whitewater
prosecutors under a limited grant of immunity, meaning that Starr
was not to use the material to prosecute Hubbell. The records had
been subpoenaed by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"The subpoena served on Mr. Hubbell was the quintessential
fishing expedition," Robertson said. "The independent counsel
freely admits that he was not investigating tax-related charges
when he issued it."
</P>
<P>
The judge said that by giving the documents to Starr, "Mr.
Hubbell was thereby turned into the primary informant against
himself."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Robertson signaled his displeasure with Starr's
decision to prosecute Hubbell a second time, saying prosecutors
had a "scary" view of the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
During that hearing, the judge sharply questioned prosecutors
about their handling of the tax evasion indictment against Hubbell
and the three others.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, a golfing buddy of President Bill Clinton and former
law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been a key figure in
the four-year Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
A little over a year into Clinton's presidency, Hubbell
resigned as the No. 3 Justice Department official under a cloud of
allegations he had defrauded the former Arkansas law firm where he
and Mrs. Clinton had worked.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994 he pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail
fraud and promised to cooperate with Starr's investigation of the
Clintons' Arkansas business dealings. He served 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's decision follows a series of recent setbacks for
Starr. They include the Supreme Court decision that a lawyer for
White House aide Vincent Foster does not have to surrender notes
taken in conversations shortly before Foster killed himself; the
release of Clinton business partner Susan McDougal from prison;
and the Supreme Court's refusal to give emergency consideration to
Starr's attempts to force testimony from three Secret Service
employees and presidential aide Bruce Lindsey.

LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble was elected first minister of the
Northern Ireland Assembly at its inaugural meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic and Labor Party's deputy Seamus Mallon
was elected second minister.
</P>
<P>
"No one at this stage can say with absolute certainty that
success is guaranteed," Trimble said after the election. But he
added, "We have started on the long march towards a better future
and we are determined to continue."
</P>
<P>
His deputy Mallon said, "We share hope. We share a conviction
that now, at the end of this century, we are going to change the
face of life in the north of Ireland."
</P>
<P>
"I feel a great sense of humility -- and it's not a virtue that
I am normally imbued with," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's first assembly meeting marked a milestone in its
long and troubled peace process as those who killed each other to
end or prolong British rule gathered side by side with victims of
their "war" and their arch-enemies as key players in a new
assembly.
</P>
<P>
But the assembly has a long way to achieve peace in the
province. Trimble faces a mammoth task of trying to heal a wound
in the Protestant community which has festered since it became
clear Sinn Fein would for the first time work in a body under
British jurisdiction.
