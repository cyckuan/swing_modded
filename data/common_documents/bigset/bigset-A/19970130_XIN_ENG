<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
backed and funded a small corps of retired military personnel in
helping to turn worn Muslim and Croat soldiers into a strong army
against Serbs in Bosnia, a U.S. newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
While NATO-led forces attempted to secure an unsteady peace in
Bosnia, the ex-GIs were engaged in an "unusual crash effort" to
help re-arm and re-train Muslims and Croats, the Washington Post
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials who support the program claimed they hoped
to establish "a rough balance of military power in the region and
facilitate the removal of foreign troops".
</P>
<P>
"But it is an enormously ambitious undertaking, given the
poorly trained, ill-equipped condition of the Muslim and Croat
military forces," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Complicating matters, most European governments want no part
of the program, and some senior U.S. military officers have
reservations about it too," it added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the opinion aired that pouring new
weaponry and military instruction into the Balkans was "an
invitation to renewed conflict and undercuts enforcement of
arms-control limits."

The newspaper quoted the opinion aired that pouring new

</P>
<P>
North Atlantic Treaty Organization commanders in Bosnia were
monitoring the program closely and giving it little leeway,
restricting where and when Bosnian units could train, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, peacekeeping forces seized part of a
U.S. tank-ammunition shipment.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials saw little danger in the program,
saying it had proven effective in leveraging two key U.S. aims in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"First, it has driven the Muslims and Croat forces to begin
merging into a single army, which up to now has existed only on
paper,"the report said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the promise of U.S. military assistance compelled
Muslims to close off their links with Islamic countries.

<HEADLINE> US Durable Goods Orders Down in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods declined by 1.7 percent in December, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last for more than three years, totaled a seasonally
adjusted 169 billion dollars in December, down from 171.8 billion
in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was led by a 12.5 percent plunge in orders for
electronic and other electrical equipment such as circuit boards
and communications gear. It followed a 10.2 percent drop in
November.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders were unchanged while orders for
industrial equipment such as computers and household appliances
increased by 1.5 percent, the first rise since July.
</P>
<P>
Unfilled orders were unchanged in December after edging up 0.3
percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, declined by 0.8
percent, wiping out a 0.8 percent advance a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the orders, a key gauge of the U.S. manufacturing
sector, matched the November decrease and was the seventh decline
of the year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also held down the gain in 1996 to 5.5 percent, the smallest
increase since orders grew by 5.4 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The December decline contrasted with other recent economic data
which suggested the economy was growing moderately at the end of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Loses 300,000 Hectares of Forests Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian top government
official today appealed to local communities, non-governmental
organizations and churches in the country to be involved in the
campaign against forest degradation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Permanent Secretary for Environment and Natural
Resources Marcharligne Mkhuwa said that she made the appeal
because government effort alone would not yield the intended
results.
</P>
<P>
Mkhuwa made the appeal when she closed the 1996/97 tree
planting season at an in-service teachers college in Chongwe,
Lusaka province.
</P>
<P>
She said that the country is losing over 300,000 hectares of
forests annually through various destructive activities.
</P>
<P>
Mkhuwa noted that the consequences and results of forest loss
vary, most of which are evident in such areas as the drying of
perennial rivers and wells, poor crop yields in farms and serious
shortage of firewoods.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems stem from lack of knowledge in the
sustainable use of the natural resources and poverty, Mkhuwa
said. She urged public education on the importance of forests.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has in the
past 10 years been carrying out a public education campaign to
educate and encourage the community to practice agro-forestry and
community forestry to uplift the country's environmental issues
as well as improving the food security, home incomes and
provision of wood energy in the country.

<P>
PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today categorically denied
an accusation by Belgium that "thousands of (Rwandan) soldiers"
are in eastern Zaire fighting for the Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Belgium has become senile.... They no longer know
where the frontiers are; nor can they make difference between
Rwanda and Zaire," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a senior
Rwandan official as saying on a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Foreign Ministry said today that it has received
"more and more information on the presence of Rwandan troops in
Zaire."
</P>
<P>
"If the information is confirmed, it will be a violation of the
territorial integrity of Zaire and a totally unacceptable
situation," said a Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Claude Dusaidi, advisor of Rwandan Vice President and Defense
Minister Paul Kagame, said that one should "first of all ask
Belgium what the Belgian mercenaries are doing in Zaire." Belgium
wants to "deviate the attention" of the international community,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been any Rwandan soldier in Zaire," he said,
adding that Rwanda has enough problems within its own frontiers.

<HEADLINE> SADC Not to Issue Ultimatum Over COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- a sadc official said here today
SADC has not issued an ultimatum urging the withdrawal of its
members from the troubled Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Kgosinkwe Moesi, Information officer of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) said the regional body would let
individual member states decide which organization they wanted to
belong to.
</P>
<P>
SADC members who also belong to COMESA ''will exercise their
sovereign right to decide which of the two organizations they
prefer'', he said.
</P>
<P>
''This is in accordance with a decision by the SADC Heads of
State at their 1994 summit held in Gaborone, Botswana. There was
no ultimatum or deadline imposed on member countries to choose
between the two organizations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments come in the wake of reports that some SADC
members were seriously reviewing their continued membership of
COMESA, created in 1992 to forge a common market in east, central
and southern Africa by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
He was correcting impression created by the media in Zambia
and Namibia that SADC had told its members to leave COMESA, whose
Secretary-General Bingu Wa Mutharika has been sent on a forced
three-month leave to facilitate allegations of maladministration
made against him.
</P>
<P>
SADC comprises of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. All of these except Botswana and
South Africa also belong to COMESA, whose other members are
Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda,
Sudan, Uganda and Zaire.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former prime
minister Benazir Bhutto said today that the Supreme Court's
verdict against her petition to revive her ousted government was
expected.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), told
the local press in the southern port city of Karachi tonight that
she did not expect that the coming polls would be fair.
</P>
<P>
However, she said her party will not boycott the elections
scheduled for February 3.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto also claimed that if the elections were held in a fair
manner the PPP would win.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), one of the major
political parties in Pakistan, hailed the Supreme Court verdict.
</P>
<P>
"This order of the Supreme Court justifies to uphold the orders
of the President," said an MQM official in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates the kind of callousness and the kind of terror
that the government of Bhutto had unleashed on the people of
Pakistan," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement of Justice) also welcomed
the Supreme Court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the newly-formed PTI, Imran Khan, said at a press
conference in Lahore this evening that his party had already
announced that they would accept the decision of the court,
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan, former national cricket captain who founded his
party last April, said the court's decision will play an important
role in strengthening the democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The PTI will participate in the February 3 general elections
with "more dedication, devotion and enthusiasm", imran added.
</P>
<P>
Awais Gangash, an official from the Media Department of the
PPP, told Xinhua that the court's decision "is a scar on the
federation of the country."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Muslim League (N), widely considered to be the
most potential political party to win the forthcoming elections,
hoped that Benazir Bhutto would accept the Court decision.
</P>
<P>
Liaquat Ali, the political secretary of the PML(N), said in a
telephone interview with Xinhua that the uncertainty prevailing in
the country's current political situation will now be reduced as a
result of the Supreme Court's ruling today.
</P>
<P>
"Everything goes on as expected," he said. "Our party will win
the elections."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Supreme Court today upheld the presidential
proclamation last November by a 6-1 verdict, dismissing Benazir
Bhutto's petition challenging the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member bench of the court, which concluded the
hearing earlier in the day with Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in
the chair, met at 3:30 pm (1030 GMT) and then announced a 12-page
short order.
</P>
<P>
According to the verdict, the Presidential Order last November
contained enough substance, and an ample material had been
provided to conclude that the ousted government of Benazir Bhutto
could not be run in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today also rejected the petition filed by the
Speaker of the National Assembly, Yosuf Raza Gillani, and ruled
that the dissolution of the National Assembly was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto has said that her party would go ahead with the general
elections if the Supreme Court rejected her petition.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Laghari sacked the Benazir Bhutto government
on November 5, 1996, accusing her of mass corruption, misruling,
economic disrupt and extra-judicial killings.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was also dissolved on the same day. And
the President announced that general elections will be held on
February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto filed her first petition on November 13, 1996,
challenging the dismissal of her government. But it was returned
by the Supreme Court on November 19 on the grounds that it
contained frivolous, un-necessary and scandalous material.
</P>
<P>
The modified petition was re-submitted on November 21, but it
was again returned. Finally, the regular hearing on the petition
started on November 29.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Supreme Court decision today will have
a tremendous impact on Pakistan's political situation in the
coming days.

<HEADLINE> UK Rejects Spain's Move to Share Gibraltar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government said here
today that it has flatly rejected Spain's proposal to share
sovereignty over Gibraltar, saying the inhabitants of the
territory would not accept it.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed today that Spanish
Foreign Minister Abel Matutes last week "raised informally with
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind the matter of joint
sovereignty over Gibraltar, as he has done on a previous
occasion."
</P>
<P>
"The foreign secretary rejected the idea because such a
proposal did not have the consent of the people of Gibraltar," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Spanish proposal, Spain would share joint sovereignty
of Gibraltar with Britain for up to 100 years and then London
should hand back the control of the territory to the Spanish
government.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-15th century, Gibraltar was ruled by Spain and
merged into Spanish territory in 1501. In 1704, Austria captured
Gibraltar with the joining of Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The treaty of Utrecht, which was signed in 1713, formally
recognized Gibraltar as British and it became a British colony in
1830.

<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign
Minister Gabriel Roric today charged Ethiopia and Eritrea with
"unprovoked aggression" which he said now threatens the
sovereignty of his country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters after an hour-long meeting here
with Zimbabwe's Vice-president Simon Muzenda in which he briefed
him on the current political situation in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Roric said, "the unprovoked aggression by Ethiopia and Eritrea
is of great concern to the government and people of Sudan. The
sovereignty of Sudan has been abused and Sudan can no longer
stand by and watch but is bound to defend itself from
foreign-backed aggression."
</P>
<P>
He said he was also hoping to meet Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe soon to brief him on the developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sudan feels obliged to inform Zimbabwe, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Conflict Prevention
Committee, as it is the duty of the African leaders to put their
minds together in resolving African conflicts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Roric said African leaders should convene an urgent meeting to
resolve the conflict and consider why outsiders are trying to
keep Africa in constant chaos.

ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today denied rumors that his government was considering
delaying Italy's entry into the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
"These are absurd rumors without any basis in fact and which

"The government's program has been spelled out," he said. "We

Prodi said he was confident Italy would meet the convergence
criteria in the Maastricht Treaty for joining the single currency
at its launch in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It required a major effort and was the number one priority for
the whole government, he said.

"Belonging to Monetary union is increasingly important for us
and I do not see any factors which can cast doubt on our

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Holds Talks With Russian Envoys on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today held talks with two envoys of Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and noted a "wide-ranging coincidence of
views" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Director of the third directorate for European affairs at the
Russian Foreign Ministry Vladimir Tchizov and deputy director of
the ministry's international organization' department Aleksandr
Orlov are visiting Athens, Nicosia and Ankara to highlight
Moscow's willingness to play an active role in finding a solution
to problems in the southeast Mediterranean, particularly the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Pangalos said the two sides shared the view
that the United Nations should be the principal agency in efforts
to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that all separate initiatives aimed at finding a
Cyprus settlement were welcome, Pangalos said that the Russian
initiative was one of the most important.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said the discussion had also revolved around the basic
principles governing international relations and the operation of
the UN which, he added, must be respected by all.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the Russian officials for Moscow's assistance
in bolstering Cyprus' defense -- a clear reference to the
anti-aircraft missile system recently ordered by Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Moscow was concerned about the reaction to the
missile purchase from Turkey and the United States, Tchizov
replied, "Russia is concerned about the lack of progress in the
Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the missile deal, Tchizov said that Moscow's
position was already known. He reiterated that Cyprus, like any
other sovereign state, had every right to conclude agreements.
</P>
<P>
He also launched a thinly veiled attack on those who he said
"want to leave Russia out of the arms market."

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Deficit Widens in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global visible trade
deficit widened unexpectedly towards the end of last year,
suggesting that the strength of the pound is hurting exporters,
according to official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that Britain's
world trade gap widened from 680 million pounds (1.1 billion US
dollars) in October to 959 million pounds (1.55 billion dollars)
in November as export volumes fell and import volumes rose.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes fell 2.5 percent in November compared with the
previous month, while import volumes rose by 1.7 percent to a
record level.
</P>
<P>
More up-to-date figures showed that the trade deficit with
countries outside the European Union (EU) also rose by more than
expected in December to 844 million pounds (1.37 billion dollars)
from 699 million pounds (1.13 billion dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes to non-EU countries fell 9 percent in December
on the previous month, the biggest monthly decline since record
began in 1988, while import volumes were up 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the fall in export volumes was almost
certainly the result of the rising pound although they have also
been damaged by prolonged slow growth in key European export
markets, such as Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the trade gap could deteriorate further if
strong consumer-led growth and a pick-up in investment in Britain
raised demand for more imports.
</P>
<P>
The figures would once again strengthen Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's hand in resisting calls for higher
interest rates, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, Treasury officials noted that the quarterly picture
remained more optimistic, with the deficit for the three months to
November broadly the same as in the previous three months at 2.9
billion pounds (4.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the longer-term trend was still for the gap
to narrow again in the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Italian Finance Official Confident of Deficit Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Italian finance official
today said that he was confident that the Italian budget deficit
for 1997 would reach the requirement for joining the European
Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Monorchio, head of the Public Accounting Office, said
Italy's 1997 budget deficit would hit the target of three percent
of gross domestic product, one of the requirements set by the
Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover," he added, "we have already been accredited by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the
International Monetary Fund, which are independent and neutral
institutions, for a ratio of between three and four percent."
</P>
<P>
He said there was not yet any factor indicating a public sector
borrowing requirement galloping to as high as 139 trillion lire
(about 86.88 billion U.S. dollars) and urged all sides to ignore
any figures floating around and await the quarterly report due out
at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Italy's grandest academic establishment, the
Academia dei Lincei, Monorchio denied press accounts of a PSBR
for 1997 of 139 trillion lire. "It was said that this was data
which came out of the Public Accounting Office but this is not the
case."
</P>
<P>
"The Public Accounting Office will calculate the projected
deficit only when the data for an analysis of 1996 are in and will
make the 1997 projections with reference to these
calculations. Thus, I disown the figure of 139 trillion lire,"
added Monorchio.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the accounting office chief was forced to deny
rumors that public accounts were straying off track. "Everything
is as foreseen. The January data are good," Monorchio said, adding
that it is too soon to talk of corrective measures.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Supreme Court Rejects Bhutto Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- After nearly two weeks of
formal hearing, Pakistan's Supreme Court today made its verdict on
the sacking of Benazir Bhutto's government early last November,
saying the move is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld the
Presidential Proclamation by a 6-1 verdict, dismissing Benazir
Bhutto's petition challenging the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour hearing today, the Court announced a 12-page
short order, rejecting the petitions filed by Bhutto and National
Assembly Speaker Yosuf Raza Gillani.
</P>
<P>
The Court ruled that the Presidential Order last November
contained enough substance and that an ample material had been
provided to conclude that the ousted government of Benazir Bhutto
could not be run in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), told
the press in Karachi that the Supreme Court's verdict against her
petition was expected since her government has not been restored
in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the February 3 elections, Bhutto, 45, said that
she did not expect that the coming polls would be fair.
</P>
<P>
However, the PPP leader said that her party will go ahead with
the elections.
</P>
<P>
If the elections were held in a fair manner the PPP would win,
she claimed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major political parties in the country have hailed
the Supreme Court verdict.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Muslim League (N), widely considered to be the
most potential political party to win the forthcoming elections,
appreciated the Court ruling and hoped that Benazir Bhutto would
accept the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Liaquat Ali, the political secretary of the PML(N), said in a
telephone interview with Xinhua that the uncertainty prevailing in
the country's current political situation will now be reduced as a
result of the Supreme Court's ruling today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) said: "this
order of the Supreme Court justifies to uphold the orders of the
President."
</P>
<P>
"It demonstrates the kind of callousness and the kind of terror
that the government of Bhutto had unleashed on the people of
Pakistan," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly-formed Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf
(Movement of Justice) also welcomed the Supreme Court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the PTI and the former national cricket team captain,
Imran Khan, said the court's decision will play an important role
in strengthening the democratic institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The PTI will participate in the February 3 general elections
with "more dedication, devotion and enthusiasm", imran added.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Laghari sacked the Bhutto Benazir government
on November 5, 1996, accusing her of mass corruption, misruling,
economic disrupt and extra-judicial killings.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was also dissolved on the same day. And
the President announced that general elections will be held on
February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto filed her first petition on November 13, 1996,
challenging the dismissal of her government. But it was returned
by the Supreme Court on November 19 on the grounds that it
contained frivolous, un-necessary and scandalous material.
</P>
<P>
The modified petition was re-submitted on November 21, but it
was again returned. Finally, the regular hearing on the petition
started on November 29.
</P>

It is believed that the Supreme Court decision today will have
a tremendous impact on Pakistan's political situation in the
coming days.

<HEADLINE> Workers at GM Plant in Ohio End 3-Day Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Workers in the General
Motors Corporation's Ohio truck plant returned to work today after
a three-day strike.
</P>
<P>
In a tentative agreement on a new contract reached Tuesday, GM
agreed to settle all grievances which included disputes over
overtime and sick days.
</P>
<P>
The strike by 4,300 GM workers began Sunday after workers
rejected a three-year contract proposal by the GM. Union officials
complained that GM had failed to settle hundreds of grievances,
including disputes over overtime and discharged workers.
</P>
<P>
The plant in the suburb of Dayton makes the Oldsmobile Bravada,
Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy. It produces about 1,000 vehicles a
day and is the only GM plant assembling the Bravada.
</P>
<P>
GM suffered a great loss from the strikes last year.
</P>
<P>
GM announced Tuesday that two strikes last October had reduced
its after-tax income in the fourth quarter by 700 million dollars,
according to The New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Another strike in Dayton, Ohio, last March reduced GM's
after-tax income by another 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. industrial experts said that the total strike-related loss
of 12 billion dollars appeared to be a record before being
adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
GM, the biggest auto maker in the U.S., announced it earned 786
million dollars in the last quarter of 1996, down sharply from 1.6
billion in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, GM's profits fell to 4.96 billion dollars,
down from 6.88 billion in 1995.

<HEADLINE> CBI Sets Out Priorities Beyond Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has set its sights beyond the general election to
tackle long-term business issues, CBI Director-General Adair
Turner said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the CBI's National Council
meeting endorsed the CBI work program for the coming year, Turner
said, "Whatever happens between now and May, there are fundamental
issues for business which need attention."
</P>
<P>
He highlighted five policy areas on which the CBI will be
focusing in 1997:
</P>
<P>
-- Economic and Monetary Union. The CBI will consult its
members over the first eight months of 1997 to determine a
position on whether the UK should join EMU and whether it should
do so in the first wave;
</P>
<P>
-- Labor Market Flexibility. The CBI is undertaking research
into labor market flexibility across Europe to inform the EMU
decision, and as the basis for promoting the required changes in
Europe;
</P>
<P>
-- Education and Training. The CBI will be focusing particular
attention on primary education. Employers believe more effort must
be put into laying strong education foundation;
</P>
<P>
-- Manufacturing. The CBI is undertaking a major project to
take stock of the competitiveness of UK manufacturing, to
determine whether impediments to success still remain, and to
identify where improvements in the UK's performance can be made;
</P>
<P>
-- Transport Infrastructure. The CBI will continue to
investigate how the UK can balance the conflicting requirements of
business, the environment and public finances, and will address
the full range of approaches possible, including changes in the
tax and pricing systems.
</P>
<P>
These are policies that demand attention if Britain is to
succeed and prosper in the global economy, Turner stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CBI leader said, "The changing nature of the world in which
we do business brings both challenges and opportunities, and the
CBI should be at the heart of that change."

<HEADLINE> Greek Companies to Construct Energy Projects in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Greek engineering companies
and their bankers presented here today a 38 million dollar project
aimed at securing for Moldova liquid fuel supplies by sea for the
first time in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The two companies -- Elliniki Technodomiki and Avax -- have
undertaken the study, construction and operation of a port
terminal, eight fuel storage tanks and auxiliary facilities in the
area of Giurgiulesti on the banks of the Danube River.

<P>
In addition to the construction and project management, the
Greek companies will also operate the venture for 25 years on a
build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis.
</P>
<P>
The terminal and other facilities to be built at Giurgiulesti
will have an annual capacity for moving 2.1 million metric tons of
liquid fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed last December, the project is
expected to be completed within 20 months.
</P>
<P>
The project in effect inaugurates a major Greek presence in
Moldova which is expected to grow with bilateral economic
cooperation in other sectors also.

<HEADLINE> Factional Committees Formed on Negotiation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Opposing factions of
Mogadishu today announced their committee members to attend a
meeting at Ramadan Hotel of the Green Line as agreed by Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu factional leader Ali Mahdi disclosed his seven
member committee led by Mogadishu's ex-mayor Ali Ugas Abdulle
while South Mogadishu faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid also
announced his committee members under the leadership of Issa
Mohamed Siad today.
</P>
<P>
However, the nomination of the committees to negotiate does
not mean they can end the longstanding crises in the war torn
capital.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the announcement, Ali Mahdi declared that the
forthcoming meeting will be trilateral with the attendance of
Osman Ali Atto's faction which also announced today the formation
of its negotiation committee under the chairmanship of Hussein
Hirsi Shidane.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto's interior secretary said his faction should attend
all meetings concerning the internal affairs of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, reports close to the headquarters of Hussein Aidid
indicated that this faction will not attend the Ramadan meeting
if it goes beyond the bilateral one to began with.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's faction has been refusing to talk with the
faction of Osman Atto, who, once financier of the senior Aidid,
fell out with him and later said to have killed him in clashes in
late August last year.
</P>
<P>
Now the hope for a solution to the crises of Mogadishu seems
to be as complicated as ever before the Junior Aidid took the
place of his father as head of the faction.
</P>
<P>
Different calls criticizing the bilateral meeting at Ramadan
between Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi were immediately made by
different factions.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary Somalis believe that lasting peace is beyond
their reach as far as the factions of Osman Ali Atto and Hussein
Aidid cannot mend their fences and join hands with each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker Defense
Minister Shahid Hamid today expressed satisfaction over the
Supreme Court ruling rejecting the petition of former prime
minister Benazir Bhutto to revive her ousted government.
</P>
<P>
"The way has now been paved for the people to elect their
representatives in the February 3 election to be held in a fair,
transparent and impartial manner, as promised by the government,"
Hamid said here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, caretaker Information Minister Ahmad Haqqani said in
Rawalpindi, the sister city of Islamabad, that the Supreme Court's
verdict has proved that the president's act to dissolve the
assembly was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
No body should cast doubt on the dignity and sovereignty of the
judiciary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled earlier in the day that the sacking of
Benazir Bhutto's government and the dissolution of the National
Assembly by President Farooq Leghari last November is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
This means that the general elections will go ahead on February
3 as planned.

ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine persons died of
rabies and over 1,000 others were bitten by rabid dogs in Addis Ababa
and its environs during the last five months, the Ethiopian Nutrition
and Health Research Institute said today.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic, Bildt Discuss Incidents in Separation Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic and the international community's High Representative Carl
Bildt held a meeting today over incidents between Serbs and
Muslims in the separation zone.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, held in the Serb city of Banja Luka, Bildt
told reporters they had primarily discussed how to end violence in
the Zone of Separation where Muslim refugees who tried to return
home in Lopare in northeastern Bosnian were attacked Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authorities and the International Police Task Force
"will set up a commission to investigate the incident so that the
perpetrators could be punished," the Tanjug news agency quoted
Bildt as saying in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The high representative noted that the mixed patrols would be
in charge of the area, and the Serb side would be held responsible
in case of repeated incidents.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that all refugees and displaced persons must
be enabled to return to their homes as stipulated in the Dayton
peace agreement, and that the same would be applied for all
interested Serbs from Drvar and Glamoc, towns now under the
control of the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The three and half year civil war in Bosnia has driven around 2
million people to become refugees or displaced persons, and more
than half of them are seeking asylum outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Talking about refugees problems, Plavsic said, "All
complications are due to the fact that there are no reciprocal
situations... since Serbs do not dare go back to the Muslim side
and Muslims keep on returning steadily."
</P>
<P>
She also said that Muslim refugees who wish to return to their
homes located in the separation zone can do that but they must
first apply to the Serb authorities on a case by case basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian vice-president Abdul
Halim Khaddam arrived Muscat, Oman today on a one-day visit to
the Gulf state, according to reports reaching here from Oman.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the forth leg of khaddam's seven-nation trip to the
Gulf region, which has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and will also take him to Bahrain,
Qatar and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after his arrival, Khaddam said that his
trip to the Gulf region aimed at briefing Gulf states the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process and seeking these
countries' supports for Syria's position on resuming peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said his country was prepared to revive peace talks with
Israel which were broken off a year ago, however, the resumption
must be based on the point at which the two sides halted.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that peace talks with Israel should be restarted
on the basis of returning the Golan Heights which was captured by
Israel from Syria in 1967, while Israel said the resumption
should begin "without precondition".
</P>
<P>
Khaddam criticized Israel's position, saying the present
intransigent policy by Israeli government and its rejection to
the principle of peace hindered resumption of negotiations on the
Syrian-Israeli track. He also called for intensive Arab and
international efforts to force Israel to commit itself to UN
resolutions concerned on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived Muscat after a two-day visit to the UAE. He
was accompanied by Syrian Foreign Minister Farooq Sharaa. Daring
his visit to Oman, Khaddam will held talks with some Omani
leaders and senior officials to discuss issues of common interest
and exchange Views on the developments in the Middle East peace
process.

OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Japan are to hold a
summit in Toronto this Saturday to discuss ways to resolve the
hostage crisis in Lima, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
announced today.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has been chosen for the site of the meeting because of
its role as a member of the Commission of Guarantors and the
convenience of its location for both leaders," said a short
statement from Chretien's office.
</P>
<P>
"It has not been decided whether the prime minister will attend
the meeting or not, since Canada is not hosting the meeting," a
spokeswoman of Chretien's office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto would like to meet Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
this weekend to discuss ways to settle the hostage-taking crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japan is worried about the way Peru is handling a standoff with
leftist rebels holding 72 hostages, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hashimoto urged Peru to show restraint and to
"exercise sufficient caution so as not to bring about an
unexpected situation."
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials have urged Fujimori to seek only a peaceful
resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leftist rebels raided the Japanese embassy in Lima on
December 17. They have since released most of the 500 hostages
they took.

He is "a great Pan Africanist" and "his contribution

<HEADLINE> Tenancy Rights Qualify Refugees to Vote in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Refugees will be able to vote
at the local elections in Bosnia, slated for July 12-13, in places
where they intend to live or in places they proved to have lived
before the war, the Tanjug news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules adopted by the Sarajevo-based Provisional
Electoral Commission, proof of possession of houses must be in
conformity with the position of the international community's High
Representative's office and the commission for real estate claims,
who recognize only pre-war owners and holders of tenancy rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug reports from Sarajevo, the electoral
commission assessed that stricter rules will prevent numerous
abuses, which lead to the postponing of municipal elections last
year. The commission has decided to set up a special
sub-commission made up of one international member and members
from Bosnia's two entities, which will decide about registration
and prevent attempts of false registration by political parties or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The elections for local assemblies in Bosnia were originally
planned for September 14, 1996, but were postponed to the summer
of this year because of possible election fraud during the voting.
</P>
<P>
The head of the mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Bosnia, Robert Frowick, said that
the rules and regulations for municipal elections had been adopted
by consensus.
</P>
<P>
Like the general elections last September, local elections in
Bosnia will be monitored by international observers with the help
of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR), the international
police and representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Arrives in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan's envoy for Cyprus, Han Sung Joo, arrived here today in a
fresh effort to bring the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities here to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival in Larnaca Airport, Han said "we
think that there is a window of opportunity this year,
hopefully during the first half of this year, and I will try
to find areas of agreement between the two communities."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he would try to move to facilitate a situation,
in which the leaders of the two communities can discuss the matter
face to face in direct talks.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced in New York Tuesday that
Annan is determined to intensify efforts to resolve the
decades-old Cyprus question and to achieve an overall political
settlement this year.
</P>
<P>
"This determination enjoys the support of the international
community. The Secretary General has therefore instructed Professor
Han to discuss with the leaders of the Cypriot communities
preparations for face-to-face talks in the coming months," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held
on and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened on this eastern Mediterranean island in
recent weeks after the Cyprus government announced a decision to
buy surface-to-air missiles from Russia, and Turkey said it
would take whatever action was needed to ensure they were not
deployed.
</P>
<P>
On Cypriot government decision to buy Russian missiles, Han
said this has made the process "even more difficult." But he said
he did not think this is "a decisive impediment" to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy also disclosed that he has "some new
ideas" when he meets with two communities' leaders and noted
that previous ideas would be floated as well.
</P>
<P>
This is Han's fourth trip to Cyprus since his appointment
as U.N. special representative last May.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long stay here, Han will have separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in Nicosia, Han will fly on to Athens and Ankara
for talks with the Greek and Turkish governments on the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The island remained partitioned since 1974 when Turkish
troops occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Gambian President Yabya Jammeh
praised today the Egyptian initiative for establishing a zone free
of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here today at the end of his
three-day visit to Egypt, Jammeh commended the vital role played
by Egypt in clinching the treaty for establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in Africa, which was signed in Cairo in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Gambian president, who arrived here Sunday, held two
rounds of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The visit offered a unique opportunity to the two leaders to
conduct a "fruitful exchange of views" on bilateral issues as well
as on other matters of common interest, especially the African and
the Middle East arena.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their concern over the conflicts in some African
nations, the two leaders expressed their hope that peace would
prevail in Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, the Great Lakes area
and Liberia through negotiations for the welfare of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh and Mubarak called for closer Afro-Arab ties in general and
enhanced cooperation among the Organization of African Unity, with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League in
particular.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed the situation in the Middle East and
welcomed the signature of the accord on the implementation of the

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Reiterates Adherence to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad
today reiterated Syria's adherence to the peace process and to the
principles of the peace march that started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Assad made this statement during his meeting here this
afternoon with Miguel Angel Moratinos, special envoy of the
European Union to the Middle East, who is currently visiting
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian presidential spokesman, Assad welcomed
Europe's intention to play a positive and effective role in favor
of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
President Assad discussed with the EU envoy the peace process
and the current European efforts to reactivate the process and to
bring about a resumption of peace negotiations on the
Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Moratinos underscored Europe's interest in
undertaking a positive role in the search for peace.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moratinos disclosed in an interview with Syrian
television today that any peace in the Middle East must
incorporate Syria. Thus, he said: "we have decided to build strong
future relations as well as partnership with Syria in order to
establish that we can bring about peace, stability and prosperity
in the whole Middle East region."
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived in Damascus Tuesday evening from Israel and
soon held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara on the
Middle East peace process and the European role in this regard.

<P>
Following the talks, the EU envoy said "we have to work
seriously for the resumption of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli
track, and we hope that this will take place."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was carrying ideas to push forth the peace
process, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources here say that Moratinos' visit
aims at examining the role the EU may undertake in future to help
bring about the resumption of negotiations between Syria and
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Minister Declares for Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A 59-year-old clergyman and
former cabinet minister today declared his candidacy for the 7th
Iranian presidential elections scheduled for the coming June.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Hojjatoleslam
Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, who is at present presidential advisor and
president of Iran's Library, is the third person that has
announced his candidacy for the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates are also clergymen. They are Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Speaker of Majlis and Mohammad Mohammadi
Reyshahri, former information minister and leader of the Iranian
pilgrims for the annual Hajji ceremonies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Khatami's toughest challenge is
coming from the rightist camp and its front-runner candidate
Nateq-Nouri, who is supported by the most important rightist and
pro-Bazaar faction called the Association of Combatant Clergymen
(ACC).
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in the dry and arid city of Yazd, Khatami
helped the growth of Iranian cinema, literature and press with
his liberal policies while he was the minister of culture and
Islamic guidance between 1982 and 1992.

ANKARA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Central Bank will
stop issuing certificates of deposit to those customers who
refuse to disclose their identity as part of efforts to crack
down on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the Central Bank said
the new regulation would come into effect after the decree was
published in the Official Gazette and existing certificates would
remain valid until expiry.
</P>
<P>
The new measure is taken to tackle the problem of money
laundering which has run rampant in Turkey in recent years,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish parliament adopted a law aimed at curbing money
laundering in November of last year as part of a battle
against organized crime, particularly drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The law envisaged the creation of an institution to
investigate financial crimes which would pass on its findings to

<HEADLINE> Toyota Warns to Shift Investment from Britain to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese carmaker Toyota warned
Britain today it would build future factories in continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Toyota president Hiroshi Okuda told reporters that the Japanese
carmaker was already reviewing its levels of investment in
Britain, according to reports from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Okuda was asked if the carmaker's future strategy in Britain
would change, depending on whether the UK joined the EMU, he said:
"regardless on whether Britain joins, I have a feeling that it
would be excessive if we made additional investments in Britain."
</P>
<P>
The Conservative government says that if it wins the next
general election, due to be held in May, it is very unlikely to
take Britain into the first stage of EMU.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Okuda's remarks, a spokesman from Downing Street
said he was not prepared to take the remarks at face value, saying
Toyota only last year announced 200 million pounds (325 million US
dollars) in additional investment at its plant in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"That indicates to me great confidence in the United Kingdom,"
he said. "The UK is the place to be and remains so."
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang, Britain's President of Trade Board, said the
government had always stood up for Japanese carmakers based in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a statement aimed at reassuring Japanese businessmen, he
added: "No decision on economic and monetary union has been taken.
We have made it quite clear that we will not make this decision
until we know all the facts."
</P>
<P>
However some Tory MPs are worried about the negative impact
caused by Okuda's remarks. Hugh Dykes said: "This is a serious
warning from one of the world's most important companies, and we
ignore it at our peril."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party seized on the remarks. Its Economics
spokesman Gordon Brown said: "This is the first sign of industry
reacting to the Tories' infighting and disunity over Europe."

<HEADLINE> French Left Parties Denounce Chirac-Kohl Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- France's leftwing opposition
parties today denounced the agreement on building a Franco-German
joint defense strategy reached by President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Nuremberg on December 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Parliament deputies of the Socialist Party, Communist Party and
some other leftwing forces said the agreement would jeopardize the
national sovereignty of France by submitting the country to a
U.S.-dominated nuclear umbrella of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today
in Bonn that by ratifying the Nuremberg agreement, France has for
the first time recognized the "pre-eminence of NATO in the field
of nuclear deterrent."
</P>
<P>
The document signed by Chirac and Kohl said that NATO's nuclear
arms, "especially those of the Americans," are decisive for the
security of Europe, while the nuclear arms of Britain and France
only make up "a remainder."
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly today saw the wide differences
between the leftist deputies and those of the ruling rightwing
majority over the document, which has been submitted to the
parliament after being kept secret for more than one month.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Fabius, president of the socialist group in parliament,
warned France against the danger of "submission to the United
States and NATO" by recognizing the dominance of nuclear
deterrent of the trans-Atlantic military alliance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"They talk about Europeanization of NATO, but this is the
inverse which produces `NATOization' of Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Communist Party parliament group, Alain
Bocquet, said that the agreement is "extremely dangerous to the
sovereignty of France."
</P>
<P>
Former defense minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said that by
moving closer to NATO, France is joining the United States.
"This is to abandon whole sections of sovereignty (of the
country) each day. We are worried about France," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Communist Party group in the French
Senate, Helene Luc, today called on the president of the Senate,
Rene Monory, to launch a debate over the Nuremberg agreement
"with the shortest delay."

<P>
HARARE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Special Envoy of the
Sudanese government Gabriel Roric today charged Ethiopia and
Eritrea with "unprovoked aggression" which he said now threatens
the sovereignty of his country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters after an hour-long meeting here
with Zimbabwe's Vice-president Simon Muzenda in which he briefed
him on the current political situation in the Horn of Africa,
the Zimbabwean News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Roric said, "the unprovoked aggression by Ethiopia and Eritrea
is of great concern to the government and people of Sudan. The
sovereignty of Sudan has been abused and Sudan can no longer
stand by and watch but is bound to defend itself from
foreign-backed aggression."
</P>
<P>
He said he was also hoping to meet Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe soon to brief him on the developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sudan feels obliged to inform Zimbabwe, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Conflict Prevention
Committee, as it is the duty of the African leaders to put their
minds together in resolving African conflicts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Roric said African leaders should convene an urgent meeting to
resolve the conflict and consider why outsiders are trying to
keep Africa in constant chaos.

<HEADLINE> New York State Senate Rejects Casino Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled New
York State Senate on Tuesday rejected a constitutional amendment
to legalize casino gambling with 41 to 19 vote, a sharp reversal
of the fortune for the measure which looked like to pass in both
houses just one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The vote dashed the hopes of resort owners, local officials and
gambling enthusiasts who had envisioned casino as a potential
wellspring of tax dollars and corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
The measurement failed largely because the political force
needed to overcome the diverse and aggressive opposition never
materialized. In the end, 19 of 35 Republicans voted no, most of
them citing concerns about the morality or social costs of
gambling. All but three of 25 Democrats present voted against it,
many saying they thought that New York City would get nothing from
it.
</P>
<P>
With Tuesday's vote, New York State joined what many gambling
analysts consider a national trend against the spread of casino
gambling.
</P>
<P>
During the late 1980's and 1990's the gambling industry
experienced swift growth beyond its historic roots in Atlantic
City and Nevada. Casino opened in 24 states of 50 states in the
united States.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Child Abuse Increase in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Reported incidents of children
under 16 being sexually abused have tripled in Greece over the
past five years, according to evidence compiled by prosecutors and
police.
</P>
<P>
According to data, 138 new cases of child abuse were reported
in Greece in 1995, 92 of these concerning girls and 46 concerning
boys. The incidents include child prostitution, pornography, rape,
incest and indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
Ioannis Tsiantis, professor of child psychiatry, and
psychologist Eleni Agathonos told a press conference today,
however, the figures do not reflect the actual extent of the
problem, as most cases of child sexual abuse go unreported.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, held in view of a meeting Friday
concerning "the sexual exploitation of children", the specialists
provided a typical profile of both a perpetrator and victim in
such cases. According to the profile, in most cases the assailant
was also abused at a young age, while victims are usually children
from lower-income or broken families.
</P>
<P>
Specialists dealing with the problem today called for
legislative measures to be taken immediately to protect children
from all forms of abuse.

WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Middle East leaders of
Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan will visit the United
States and hold separate talks with President Bill Clinton in the

</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come to Washington on Feb. 13,
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will make his visit on March
3. they will be followed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
coming on March 10 and King Hussein of Jordan on March 18.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the visits were separate because there was no
dramatic development in the peace process that would make a summit
of the leaders necessary.
</P>
<P>
"With each of these leaders we can have a somewhat more
comprehensive dialogue outside the emergency context of dealing
with a specific event that requires immediate focus and
attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the upcoming separate talks is intended to push
the Middle East peace forward.
</P>
<P>
"These are all visits in which we will explore not only the
bilateral regional concerns we have with these leaders but also
seek to deepen and strengthen the Middle East peace process as we
search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region,"

ROME, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Dino Zoff stepped down temporarily
as Lazio president on Thursday, a day after the head of the

</P>
<P>
"I have decided to stand down as president while I am coach"

Coaches' union head Azeglio Vicini, who also coached Italy to

</P>
<P>
Zoff, who won the World Cup as Italy's captain and goalkeeper

<HEADLINE> National Conference on Mineral Resources Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The state will maintain the
national ownership of China's mineral resources, and improve the
marketing of prospecting and mining rights in the next few years,
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth conference of the National Committee on
Mineral Resources, which opened here today, Zou, director of
the committee, said that the implementation of the Mineral
Resources Law would help to bring about a healthy, rapid and
sustainable development for the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up in the 1980s, when China was in the
process of shifting from the socialist planned economy to a
socialist market economy. It has improved the management of the
country's mineral resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the committee has revised some laws and
regulations on the mineral resources, rectified the orders of the
mining industry and studied the mineral exploring in middle and
western China by domestic and overseas groups, Zou noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the National Program of the Mineral Resources,
which is in effect from 1996-2010, should enable the state to
retain macro control over the mining industry, while bringing the
initiative of local governments into full play.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principle, oil and gas fields and the mines of
uranium, tungsten (Wolfram), tin (stannum), antimony (stibium) and
rare-earth metals will be controlled by the central
government. The geothermal and mineral water resources will be
managed by the local governments of provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
The resources of all the other 38 types of minerals will be
divided into about 5,000 mineral zones, the program holds.
</P>
<P>
Participants at today's conference also discussed some policies
and suggestions for revitalizing the state-owned large and
middle-sized mineral enterprises, and basically approved the
program, which will be put into practice after gaining State
Council approval.

<HEADLINE> Flourishing Non-Governmental Foreign Trade in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Non-governmental economic and
trade exchanges with foreign countries will continue to flourish
in the new year, Guo Dongpo, chairman of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
As a major organization for promoting non-governmental trade,
CCPIT is expected this year to deal successfully with European and
American business circles, through broad non-governmental channels
and in a number of ways, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The 25th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese
relations, the fifth anniversary of the establishment of Sino-ROK
diplomatic ties, and China's role as a dialogue country to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations will give CCPIT many good
opportunities to develop its cooperation with business circles in
these countries, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CCPIT will also strengthen its ties with the Hong
Kong business circle to meet Hong Kong's return to the motherland,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, CCPIT hosted 24 business delegations accompanying
officials on visits to China, and sponsored many seminars,
reports, and business meetings.
</P>
<P>
The organization also arranged for four delegations to
accompany State leaders on trips to the U.S. and European and
Asian countries, and signed many contracts and letters of intent
worth several billion US dollars, thus expanding the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, CCPIT received 111
non-governmental economic and trade delegations from foreign
countries, sent more than 60 Chinese business delegations abroad
and signed 13 cooperative agreements with its foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
To better publicize Chinese products in the international
market and promote cooperation between China and foreign
enterprises, CCPIT also helped 1200 enterprises to exhibit their
products abroad last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, CCPIT is expected to send abroad some delegations,
consisting of local government leaders and entrepreneurs from
provinces of central and western China, to seek more cooperative
opportunities, Guo noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the organization will arrange for more foreign
business delegations to visit inland areas of the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, he said, CCPIT has expanded its service to
medium-sized and small enterprises, attracting more of them to
participate in economic and trade delegations and offering them
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT has scored outstanding success in foreign trade
arbitration, Guo stressed, adding that in 1996, the China
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee and the
China Maritime Arbitration Committee accepted more than 500 cases
in Beijing alone.
</P>
<P>
In terms of intellectual property, CCPIT has handled more than
14,000 patent applications and more than 17,000 trademark
applications, he noted.

<HEADLINE> States Not to Surrender Funds to Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's state and
territory leaders have issued warnings to the federal government
that they were not prepared to surrender their funding despite the
deficit blowout.
</P>
<P>
Western Australian Premier Richard Court today joined his
counterparts, Rob Borbidge in Queensland and Jeff Kennett in
Victoria, saying that "all the states and territories have already
been very generous in helping the federal government address their
budget problems."
</P>
<P>
"The federal government must simply go through the changes that
we have been forced to go through at the state level to make sure
we can live within our means", he said over the radio.
</P>
<P>
A mid-year review of budget forecasts released this week found
that a 1.6 billion Australian dollars (1.28 billion US dollars)
shortfall in company tax collections had contributed to an almost
3 billion Australian dollars (2.4 billion US dollars) deficit
blowout prompting Treasurer Peter Costello to foreshadow a new
round of belt tightening.
</P>
<P>
State and territory leaders last year agreed to forgo 1.6
billion Australian dollars (1.28 billion US dollars) in funding to
help the Howard government achieve its goal of returning the
budget to surplus within three years.

HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the booming

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed by Cholera in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Five persons have died of
cholera in north Mogadishu, Somalia, during the past week, the
Joint Health Authority (JHA) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
JHA coordinator Dr. Osman Dufle told a press conference that
the patients died in the cholera isolation camp of Foriamini
hospital which has received 96 cholera patients since its
inauguration on January 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
New arrivals are increasing every day, said Dr. Dufle who said
he feared that more deaths would occur in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors of the hospital which is run by a
Spanish aid agency, the type of the cholera that hit Mogadishu
now is Ogaua and this type of germ claims the lives of five
percent of its victims.
</P>
<P>
They explained that this kind of germ especially kills
immediately those who are already suffering from other kinds of
sicknesses such as diabetic, etc.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agencies of WHO and UNICEF are also
distributing the necessary medicine to help curb the spread of
the disease. UNICEF is particularly working on the public
awareness programs using almost all local papers and the three
factional radios operating in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Together with other international aid agencies, they are
collectively carrying out a chlorination program to purify the
drinking water which are supplied by more than 500 wells since
the central water reservoir of the capital ceased to operate
after the international community left Somalia in March last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to health authorities, this type of cholera hits
Mogadishu once every year, especially when the shallow wells
either dry up or their water lessens during the drought season.
</P>
<P>
The had sanitation and the poorly-built latrines being used in
the capital are also attributed to the spread of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Says It's Time to Solve MFN Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said in Beijing
today that it is time now for the U.S. side to solve the matter of
China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) status once and for all, because
of the favorable developments in Sino-US ties recently.
</P>
<P>
Li met with Ronald B. Woodard, president of the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group, and spoke of MFN being mutually
beneficial, and told visiting US businessmen that approving
China's MFN status once each year is short-sighted because the
practice keeps US businesses from planning for the future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for Boeing's efforts to support
the renewal of China's MFN status in recent years and said
American business people have a clear understanding of the
importance of the Chinese market, but that some people in the
U.S., because of political considerations, put the MFN problem in
an unfair light.
</P>
<P>
Woodard spoke about the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
and of their cooperation with China, and said that after the
merger the new company will be more powerful, and will make every
effort to help solve the MFN issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the new business will consolidate cooperation
with China by continuing to provide high-quality service. Boeing
will fully support MD's cooperative projects with China, and
continue to carry out its commitment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li called the merger of the two aviation giants an important
event in world aviation history, and expressed the hope that
cooperation between the new company and China will continue.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Syria Over Killing of Its Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- In strong reaction to the
killing of three Israeli soldiers overnight by Hezbollah in south
Lebanon, Israel warned Syria today that the prospects for
renewing peace talks could be ruined.
</P>
<P>
The three Israeli soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing
during operation in the eastern sector of Israel's self-claimed
south Lebanon security zone, another soldier was injured in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the attack, the
first such incident since the new year in which Israeli soldiers
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour to a Tel Aviv hospital, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that Israeli Army was facing a
difficult mission in a brutal war in south Lebanon. He said that
Israel would do all necessary to ensure that, with time, the
Lebanon problem would be solved.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman warned Syria that, despite of the
recent optimism, it was impossible for Israel to renew the
stalled peace talks with Syria as long as Israeli soldiers were
killed in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, criticized the government for
making its recent efforts to renew the talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's efforts to renew negotiations
had sent out misleading messages to the terrorists, forcing
them to increase attacks on Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Landau added that, as long as Syria had not to pay a price,
the Hezbollah, which Israel alleged was supported by Syria and
Iran, would surely continue its military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent Israeli-Palestinian Hebron agreement
which has eased regional tension, Israel has shifted attention
to renewing the talks with Syria that broke off last March.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria has rejected Israel's repeated calls for
resuming talks without preconditions, insisting that Israel must
accept the "land-for-peace" formula and pledge full withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Macao Editorial Blasts Tendency of "Taiwan Independence" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The zigzagging relations across the Taiwan Straits over the
past two years as contrast to the the achievements of the
reunification course of the motherland has proved that Jiang's
eight-point-proposition speech is correct and serves as the
guideline in resolving the issue of Taiwan, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The proposition should be carried out with unswerving efforts,
in whatever situations, whether the cross-straits relations grows
smooth or is plunged into troubles," says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Today is the two years' anniversary of Jiang's speech, which
defines the principle of one China, suggests the steps of peaceful
talks across the Taiwan Straits and the increase of cross-straits
exchanges, and explains why the mainland refuses to pledge no
resort to arms.
</P>
<P>
The editorial praises Jiang's speech as being powerful and in
accordance with the tendency of history, saying it incorporated
flexibility while holding to principles, is to the good of China's
national interests while taking the actual interest of Taiwan into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the cross-straits relations over the past year, the
editorial calls on all compatriots of China to continue to reveal the
new split tendency and plots of the Taiwan Authorities, and carry on
the struggle against the tendency of "Taiwan Independence" to the end.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the current world situation favors the struggle as
most nations have realized that it is in their own interest and meets
the world trend of peace and development to uphold a one-China policy
and not to establish official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Even those who have established official relations with Taiwan
have poised to improve bilateral relations with the mainland," says
the article.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the editorial says the economic exchange and trade
across the Taiwan Straits should be expanded, according to the
principle that "politics and economy should be separated."
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the policy
of 'one country, two systems' is successfully implemented, the
Taiwan Authorities will face great pressure in accepting Jiang's
proposition," the editorial points out. "If they stubbornly insist
on splitting China, they will surely be abandoned by history."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Loss-Making State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji spoke
about conditions in the state-owned enterprises and government
grain-purchase stations during a recent inspection tour of
Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The planned economy and establishing of industrial projects in
the past are the main reason for the current difficulties in the
state-owned enterprises, he said, so increasing economic
restructuring, speeding up the pace of change in state firms,
pushing mergers, bankruptcy, and reemployment programs for these
enterprises are all necessary.
</P>
<P>
During his January 24-27 visit, the Chinese vice-premier spoke
with local officials, and said that the State Council policies on
lo0ss-making state firms are: reducing staff to improve efficiency,
laying off unnecessary employees to solve the problem of
overstaffing, standardizing bankruptcy procedures, and encouraging
more mergers.
</P>
<P>
All 110 cities which have been designated by the State Council
for experimenting with bankruptcy should set up their own local
coordination group on mergers, bankruptcies, and reemployment for
state enterprises, and should work out their own plan to implement
the programs, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government plan, state banks are prepared to
lose no more than 30 billion yuan this year as reserve funds for
writing off bad loans owed by state enterprises that will go
bankrupting and be merged in the 110 pilot cities on an
experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
The pilot cities will have to draft plans for mergers and
bankruptcies and must report to the upper authorities, he said,
and that localities must set up reemployment centers at all levels.
</P>
<P>
State firms that have not met the standards for merger or
bankruptcy should also work out their own reemployment program,
Zhu said. People laid off in these firms should be listed with the
reemployment service centers and be paid to cover their daily
needs, and should be helped to find a new job by the centers.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises which are unable to pay their staff's daily
needs will be offered special subsidized bank loans by the local
government as well as insurance and relief funds.
</P>
<P>
Standardizing bankruptcy procedures is intended to prevent
false bankruptcies and real debt-evasion, Zhu said. Bankrupt
factories are expected to close their doors and to dismiss all
staff.
</P>
<P>
Money gained from the sale of property should be used for
reemploying former employees, and so-called "integrity take-overs"
and "integrity purchases" are not allowed, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the government has worked out preferential
policies for bankruptcies and mergers, such as being exempt from
loan interest by enterprises that have merged with other state
firms.
</P>
<P>
He asked local government to explain things to laid-off workers
and to help them understand that what the government has done is
in their long-term interest and that the government will look
after them at present as well.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the vice-premier also expressed special
concern about the grain issue and about taxes and levies that
local farmers pay.
</P>
<P>
When there is a good grain harvest and the market price is
lower than the government purchase price, local government should
buy the excess amounts of grain and special reserve grain at
subsidized prices, he said, calling it a major government measure
taken to protect the interests of farmers and stablize the grain
market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu urged that more reforms in the country's grain
purchase system be made to help government grain purchasers to
improve controls and reduce losses.

BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng has stressed
that all of society should respect teachers, and that they should

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed by Guerrillas in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed and a forth was wounded in a bombing attack launched by
Lebanese guerrillas at an Israeli patrol in the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the pre-dawn
attack took place on a road near the town of Deir Siryan deeply
inside the Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, of Party of God, which spearheads a guerrilla warfare
against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, claimed
responsibility for the operation.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed, several
hours after the operation, that a mine exploded when an Israeli
military patrol was undertaking a mission in the eastern sector of
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was the heaviest casualties the Israeli occupation forces
in south Lebanon suffered in a single clash this year.
</P>
<P>
A relative calm has shrouded south Lebanon in the past three
weeks, following a spate of violence around the New Year.
</P>
<P>
A similar guerrilla operation took place on January 2 in
the same area, leaving one Israeli soldier killed and eight others
wounded.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Cases Increase in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
the spread of HIV/AIDS may be speeding up as venereal diseases are
running rampant in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The province reported 54 cases of the HIV/AIDS infection,
including six full-blown cases in 1996 -- a 25 percent rise in the
total number of cases since 1995, the local public health
department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, 214 HIV/AIDS cases, including 17
full-blown cases, have been reported in the province, said the
department.
</P>
<P>
China reported over 4,300 HIV infection cases last year,
including 131 cases of AIDS. Some experts have estimated that the
actual number of HIV-positive people in the country may be
anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that sexual contact still remains the major
means for the spread of HIV in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 85,300 cases of venereal disease were reported in
Guangdong last year, including 29,770 cases of gonorrhea and 4,190
cases of syphilis, an overall rate that is 3.4 times that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Based on other Asian countries' experience, the Chinese
scientists predicted that the surge of syphilis cases in the
province may lead to a wider spread of AIDS in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is one of the country's earliest pilot provinces for
reform and opening-up and thus is more easily affected by positive
and negative outside influences, medical specialists say.

YANGON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
reached 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in 233 approved projects by the
end of 1996, a Myanmar official in charge of foreign investment
said today.
</P>
<P>
U Maung Maung Yi, director-general of the Directorate of
Investment and Company Administration of Myanmar Ministry of
National Planning and Economic Development, told Xinhua that
foreign investment was recorded at 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in the
first nine months of the 1996-97 fiscal year ending in March as
compared with 660 million dollars in the same period of the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas is on the lead with the largest investment of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in 31 permitted projects, he said, adding

<HEADLINE> China Partially Opens Up Aviation Fuel Market To Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China officially opened its
aviation fuel market today, expecting to cater to the huge demand
for jet fuel with a newly-formed joint venture involving two
overseas firms.
</P>
<P>
The China Aviation Oil Supply Corporation (CAOSC), the former
Chinese monopoly, today joined with Fortune Oil PLC of Hong Kong
and Vitol Holding B.V. of Holland, to create the South China
Bluesky Aviation Oil Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Based in Guangzhou, the new venture will replace CAOSC as the
sole supplier of aviation fuels at 16 airports in Central and
South China, which account for one-third of jet fuel consumption
in China.
</P>
<P>
The airports are located in Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Meizhou
and Shantou in Guangdong Province, Guilin, Nanning, Beihai,
Liuzhou and Wuzhou in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Changsha,
Changde and Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Wuhan, Yichang and
Enshi in Hubei Province, and Zhengzhou in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since China's opening up to the outside world in late 1970s,
the fast-growing aviation fuel market has seen tense competition
for entry from foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
CAOSC holds 51 percent of the 205 million US dollars in
registered capital of the new joint venture. The rest of the
capital is shared equally by the Hong Kong and Dutch companies.
</P>
<P>
Barry Cheung, Chief Executive of Fortune Oil PLC, said that
China consumed some 600,000 tons of aviation fuel last year,
accounting for only one-fifth of that used by the Hong Kong
airport.
</P>
<P>
However, he claimed that he has adopted a long-term investment
strategy as the prospect for aviation fuel demand looks bright --
particularly so after the return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that China's demand for aviation fuel will
progress at an annual rate of 12-15 percent, double or triple that
of foreign countries, with new airports to be built and old ones
to renovated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Based in Hong Kong, the Fortune Oil PLC is listed on the London
Stock Exchange, but its major business is done in China, with
intense participation in many projects by the Chinese petroleum
industry.
</P>
<P>
Almost 11 percent of the share capital of the Fortune company
is held by four Chinese state-owned companies, including the China
North Industries Corporation (NORINCO).

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Mark Second Anniversary of Jiang's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held here today to
mark the second anniversary of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
eight-point proposition on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech
titled "Continue to Promote the Reunification of the Motherland,"
in which the eight-point proposition was put forward.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in charge of Taiwan affairs said, "We will
continue to follow Deng Xiaoping's basic thinking on solving the
Taiwan issue and thoroughly carry out the important speech made by
President Jiang Zemin to promote cross-straits relations and the
process of the motherland's reunification."
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech embodies the essence of Deng Xiaoping's theories
of "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems," and puts
forward the eight-point proposition for the reunification process,
noted Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Work Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Facts concerning cross-straits relations over the past two
years have shown that Jiang's speech has played an outstanding
role in safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and promoting cross-straits relations and reunification,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen warned the Taiwan authorities of their dangerous move to
ignore the status of Taiwan as only a province of China, saying
that any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan"
and "Taiwan independence" is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, said at the forum that his association will
carry on Jiang's speech and boost economic and cultural exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
A similar forum was also held in east China's Fujian Province,
which is just opposite to Taiwan across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Xi Jinping, vice-secretary of the provincial Communist Party
Committee, said that Fujian, a major ancestral home of Taiwan
compatriots, has greatly enhanced across-straits economic and
trade ties with its advantageous location.
</P>
<P>
Other provincial officials also said that they will follow
Jiang Zemin's speech in the combat against Taiwan independence
activities.

<P>
TOKYO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Teenage sensation Samppa Lajunen
soared to a hill record as he led Finland against a late Norwegian
cross-country charge to win the Nordic combined World Cup team
event in Hakuba, Japan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished third behind the Scandinavians for their first
podium climb this season, giving a morale boost to three-time
overall champion Kenji Ogiwara's comeback bid before the 1998
Olympics on his home snow.
</P>
<P>
Lajunen, the World Cup leader as a 17-year-old newcomer, flew
95.5 meters in his second attempt off the 90-meter normal hill to
crack Japanese specialist jumper Masayoshi Harada's year-old
course record by one meter.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish trio, who also included 18-year-old Hannu Manninen
and Jari Mantila, averaged 213.3 points in their two jumps to earn
a 18-second advantage over Austria's A team going into the 3 x 5
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian team of Bard Jorgen Elden, Gard Myhre and Trond
Einar Elden started the cross-country portion in fourth spot, two
minutes 11 seconds off the leaders.
</P>
<P>
They swept aside the Austrians and Japanese to clock the
fastest relay time of 40:29.3. The younger Elden, 26, crossed the
line 1:24.4 behind Manninen, followed home by Ogiwara 40.8 seconds
farther back.
</P>
<P>
Stecher was fifth in jumping but the ninth fastest among the
second skiers in the relay.
</P>
<P>
The two teenagers were due to battle it out in the individual
World Cup competition on Saturday and Sunday at this Winter
Olympics venue.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's "February 28 Uprising" Marked in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Adhering to the "one China"
principle and upholding China's reunification while opposing
"Taiwan independence" are the best ways of honoring those died in
the "February 28 Uprising" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a Beijing seminar to mark 50th anniversary of
the uprising made the statement here today.
</P>
<P>
But some people on Taiwan interpret the uprising as a "Taiwan
independence" movement, completely distorting the true story,
said Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress, and president of the Taiwan
Studies Society.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwanese people have a glorious
tradition of patriotism, and that tens of thousands made enormous
efforts, contributions, and sacrifices to safeguard state
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The "February 28 Uprising" was launched by the people of Taiwan
in 1947, in response to Chiang Kai-shek's intransigence, and later
led to an armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
Cheng told the seminar that the uprising was a spontaneous mass
movement of the people of Taiwan for democracy and autonomy, and
that the Communist Party of China commented positively on it.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that China's reunification is an
inevitable historical trend, and that those few people who go
against this historical trend will ultimately be cast aside.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
launched a major crackdown on uncertified video cassettes in
video libraries and video-show parlors.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide fight will continue until there is total
compliance with the regulations by dealers in the eastern African
country, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary for Information and Broadcasting S. Ambuka
said on Wednesday that the move follows complaints that children
were getting access to video films strictly for adults.
</P>
<P>
Following the liberalization of the national economy, Kenya is
experiencing an unprecedented video boom, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a corresponding control mechanism," he said,
adding that there has been increasing criticism against the
proliferation of uncensored films in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ambuka asked the public to cooperate and cautioned that
possession of a video cassette without a valid classification
label is an offense.

Dai Yi, president of the Chinese Society of Historical Studies,
said that the demands put forward by the people of Taiwan during
the uprising in 1947 for democracy and autonomy were completely
just and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
To peacefully reunify the motherland with the concept of "one
country, two systems" as put forward by Deng Xiaoping is in
keeping with the demands put forward during the uprising and in
the interests of the people of Taiwan, he noted, and called on the
Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and in other parts of
the world to work for the reunification.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Dianming, vice-president and secretary-general of the
Taiwan Studies Society, said that there is a practical reason for
commemorating the uprising and reviewing its history. It has been
demonstrated repeatedly throughout history that any attempt to
separate the country will not produce any good results.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ketai, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference who witnessed the
uprising first hand, said that the movement had won the sympathy
and support of the CPC Central Committee and of various parts of
society, when it took place.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee expressed its deep concern for the
people of Taiwan in an editorial in "Liberation Daily" at the
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was sponsored by the Liaison Subcommittee for
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao Compatriots, and Overseas Chinese of
the CPPCC National Committee and the Taiwan Studies Society, and
was attended by officials and scholars from various departments.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Warns U.S. Not to Extradite its Leader to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) issued a statement in Gaza Wednesday night
calling on the U.S. authorities not to extradite its leader
Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas warned that the U.S. must bear responsibility for any
unstability in the Middle East that will arise as a result of
such an act, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will also have to bear all responsibilities for any
harm Marzook might be subjected to by the Israeli General
Security Service (GSS), the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzook, 46, is a politburo member of Hamas. He was
detained at the Kennedy Airport in New York in July 1996. Since
then, he has been in solitary confinement in a Manhattan jail on
terrorism charges. The U.S. authorities plan to hand him over to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist group said it has no confidence in
the U.S. legal system, noting that the Abu Marzook case does not
rest on a just and right policy, but depends on the immoral
policy based on the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear in this case that the U.S. law serves
the Zionist Israeli interests and the lobbying Zionist American
groups," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "At a time when we condemn the U.S. Federal Law,
we call on the U.S. to refrain from extraditing Dr. Abu Marzook
to Israel."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, according to the state-owned Israel
Radio, the U.S. authorities has called on its citizens to be
careful in light of the Hamas threat.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Liberian Fighters Disarmed: Nigerian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- As many as 20,000 Liberian
faction fighters have surrendered their arms by Wednesday, two
days before the Friday deadline, the "Guardian" paper today
quoted Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Liberian faction troops stands at 35,000
to 40,000, Ikimi said on Wednesday before leaving Liberia where
he had just attended the wedding ceremony of Charles Taylor, the
leader of the National Patriotic Frontline of Liberia (NPFL).
</P>
<P>
The widely assumed figure of 60,000 fighters was unrealistic,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi expressed optimism that the Liberian elections would be
held on May 31 in accordance with a peace accord signed by the
factions in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja in August, 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, "No one was under any illusion whatsoever that there
would be no problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi reaffirmed the determination of Nigeria and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to carry on with the
Abuja peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-strong West African Peace-keeping Forces, known as
ECOMOG, will be soon reinforced by 2,500 more soldiers from
Ghana, Mali, Benin, Niger, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone found carrying arms after that date would be doing so
on his own account ... ECOMOG is now firmly on the ground and has
adequate capability to deal firmly with the situation
thereafter," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Policy Loans For Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(EximBank) will increase loans to the country's exporters of
electronics and other capital goods by over 50 percent this year,
a senior bank official said today.
</P>
<P>
EximBank's credit for exports this year is planned at 19.7
billion yuan and 101 million US dollars, up from the actual amount
of 12.8 billion yuan and 53 million US dollars last year, board
chairman Tong Zhiguang said at the bank's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Its export credits last year, which were 86.9 percent more than
the previous year, financed 4.27 billion US dollars worth of
electronics and machinery exports. The export of vessels and large
sets of electronic products rose 40 percent and 21 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
EximBank made some considerable achievements in tapping the
export credit insurance and guarantees field, Tong said, noting
that business in the two items stood at 610 million US dollars and
320 million dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said his bank approved restructuring of overseas
government loans for 53 projects last year, with the contractual
value reaching 1.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding foreign government loans by the EximBank totaled
15.53 billion US dollars by the end of last year, more than half
of such loans to China.
</P>
<P>
EximBank was set up in April of 1994 and has agent bank
relations with 113 banks in 83 countries and regions. It has
approved export seller's credits valued at 22.4 billion yuan and
5.4 million US dollars, providing funding for electronics and
machinery exports with a contractual value of 7.26 billion US
dollars, according to Tong.

<HEADLINE> HK Fire Services to Enhance Fire Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Fire Services
Department (FSD) will continue its efforts to improve fire
protection measures in older buildings, public housing estates,
and public education in fire protection so as to make Hong Kong a
safer city, a senior FSD official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Peter Cheung, director of FSD,
said that fires claimed a total of 66 lives and 648 injuries in
1996, adding that the fatality figure rose sharply as the tragic
Garley Building fire alone took 40 lives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 service members were injured and a senior fireman
was killed in the line of duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Department responded to 32,855 fire calls, and
21,107 special service calls, representing a 5.94 percent increase
in fire statistics and a 1.46 percent drop in special service
calls over 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of No.3 alarm fires or above continued
to drop from 43 in 1995 to 39 in 1996. However, he said, a No.5
alarm fire occurred at the Garley Building in Yau Ma Tei last
November, five years after the last one at Television Broadcast
City.
</P>
<P>
He said the Department devoted much effort to achieve the
performance pledge targets set for the year. In 1996, 92.9
percent of all building fires were met with six-minute graded
response time, which exceeded the 91 percent target pledged.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of fire calls will continue to
increase in 1997 and the performance pledge target for building
fire calls this year has been raised from 91 to 92.5 percent, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reforms Customs Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Customs Service
will introduce a reform in the next quarter that will allow
importers to clear their goods at the nation's ports before
paying customs duties, the "Vanguard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new arrangement will enable importers to
take delivery of their cargo and commence later the processing of
the necessary documents.
</P>
<P>
"This means that goods can leave the ports as soon as they
arrive," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the congestions in the ports can be
greatly relieved, as goods can be transferred to trucks directly
from ships on arrival.
</P>
<P>
The new measure, however, will be restricted to only reputable
organizations with good customs records, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian customs introduced a one-stop reform late last
year, which established a customs processing center and allows
importers to clear their goods at a single place.
</P>
<P>
This has cut the clearing time from about one month to one
day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Congress Ends Budget Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine bicameral
congress has finally set aside their political interests and
agreed on a 419.4 billion pesos (16 billion U.S. dollars) budget
for 1997, ending the month-long budget dispute.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget, hammered out by a joint congressional
committee Wednesday night, will be formally ratified by the House
of Representatives and the Senate soon and then signed into law by
President Fidel Ramos within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The month-long budget deadlock, the longest in the Philippine
history, was broken after the two chambers reached a compromise on
how much should be cut from the controversial countrywide
development funds (CDF) for the legislators.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the CDF for each senator will be slashed
by 40 percent to 10.8 million pesos (about 412,000 dollars) from
the original 18 million pesos (687,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the original 12.5 million pesos (470,000
dollars) CDF for each member of the lower chamber will be reduced
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also agreed to include the 74 billion pesos (2.8
billion dollars) fund for debt servicing in the 1997 budget as
proposed by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The CDF, or so-called "pork barrel," is allocated to the
legislators for the development of infrastructure in their
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The CDF is vital for the re-election of the legislators, who
have set their eyes on the 1998 general elections. But compared
with members of the lower chamber, the CDF is less important to
the senators who rely more on campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the 24-member Senate is
elected through a national vote while 200 of the 250 members of
the House of Representatives are elected from local
constituencies. The remaining members of the lower house are
appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, controlled by the opposition National People's
Coalition, had earlier pushed for a 40 percent cut in the CDF for
each legislator and the exclusion of the 74-billion-peso automatic
appropriation for debt servicing from the budget.
</P>
<P>
But the lower house, where the ruling Lakas-NUCD party enjoys a
majority, rejected the 40-percent cut bluntly and instead demanded
a 100 percent retention of its CDF.
</P>
<P>
The protracted budget row has taken toll on the country's
economy since many domestic and foreign-funded infrastructure
projects in the country have been delayed for lack of new
infrastructure spending.
</P>
<P>
The row also compromised the reputation of the congressmen, who
have been accused by critics of sacrificing the country's economy
for their own political interests.
</P>
<P>
Economists here estimated that the budget deadlock might cause
about 100 billion pesos (3.8 billion dollars) losses to the
country, or a 5 percent drop in the gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> Iran Seized 155 Tonnes of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Law Enforcement Forces
seized 155 tonnes of various kinds of narcotics at border points
in the past 10 months, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the figure suggests an increase of narcotics
products in Afghanistan "with the active support of some foreign
states for producing and smuggling them" into Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not specify the foreign countries by
names.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
Wednesday presided over the 55th session of the campaign against
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani underlined the need to eradicate the evil of
narcotics from the society and called for serious steps against
the drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Iranian government has accepted the
proposal of the secretary-general of the International Police
Commission (Interpol) regarding the holding of an international
conference on the narcotics campaign in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as a main social problems of the country
as Iran is being used as one of the best transits for smuggling
drug to Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border
area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowers the
Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught with
more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Iran executed over 4,000 drug traffickers since 1988 and there
are over 12,500 foreign smugglers in the Iranian jails.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Expects Higher Investments in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government is
expecting higher investments and more business spending in 1997,
as the manufacturing sector will do better this year than in 1996,
the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the manufacturing sector to do better in 1997, with
the turnaround in the electronics sector towards the second half
of the year", it said, adding that the other contributing factor
is several major projects are coming onstream this year.
</P>
<P>
"The EDB expects the manufacturing fixed asset investment (FAI)
and services total business spending (TBS) in 1997 to exceed the
figure in 1996 because of the strong pipeline", it said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore attracted fixed asset investment commitments in
manufacturing of 8.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.8 billion
US dollars) in 1996, a 19 percent increase over the 6.8 billion
Singapore dollars (about 4.9 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the service sector, the other engine of
growth, recorded 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.1 billion
US dollars) in total business spending in 1996, an increase of 36
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Europe and Japan were the major foreign
sources of total business spending, it said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is intense competition for the investment
dollar within the region, and from developed countries, the EDB
said that in order to enhance Singapore's competitiveness, it will
work closely with the relevant organizations to build up the
capabilities of industries and companies.
</P>
<P>
It will also review manpower capability building programs to
ensure they meet new business needs, and promote national
awareness of innovation as a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EDB will continue to attract leading Multi
National Corporations and encourage them to root their world class
activities in Singapore. At the same time, it will continue to
assist local enterprises in upgrading their capabilities to attain
world class status.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company Signs Arms Deal With Italian Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli defense contractor
Elbit Systems Ltd. has signed a three-year contract to supply
the Italian Air Force with its Opher guided weapon system.
</P>
<P>
Elbit President Joseph Ackerman told today's English daily The
Jerusalem Post that he expected that this deal, which is worth 25
million U.S. dollars, the first with the Italian military, would
help the company further penetrate the Italian market.
</P>
<P>
"The contract signifies an important milestone for Elbit
Systems as it constitutes the entry of the company into the
Italian defense market," Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that this program will lead to expanding Elbit
Systems' relations with the Italian Air Force, as well as
enhancing prospective Opher sales to additional NATO countries
and other customers," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Opher system is an autonomous guided weapon system
designed for precision strikes on surface targets. Unlike other
systems that require two people to target and fire on objects,
Opher can be operated solely by the pilot, a company
representative was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Elbit Systems develops integrated defense systems, focusing on
upgrading existing military platforms.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Urged to Attack Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government must
formulate a plan to attack the lingering unemployment problem,
Australian Democrats employment spokeswoman Natasha Stott Despoja
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of claiming labor market reform will fix unemployment,
a claim disputed by senior economists, the coalition needs to
develop a positive plan to increase jobs," Despoja said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The government admitted, when it issued its first mid-year
economic review at the cabinet meeting early this week, that the
outlook for the jobless remains gloomy, the unemployment rate will
be about 8.5 percent by June, not 8.25 percent as predicted.
</P>
<P>
Despoja said, the employment plan should be centerpiece of the
next budget and could include a consideration of export assistance
programs, small business incentives, regional development
initiatives, tax reforms as well as infrastructure programs.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Expects to Have 600,000 Tons of Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Agriculture Teketel Forsido has announced that the nation will
have 600,000 tons of surplus grain this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper "The Ethiopian Herald" today, the
minister said Ethiopia expects to harvest this year over 11.7
million tons of crop, two million tons more than that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Teketel said the production by far exceeded the target set to
fully meet the basic need of the public this year in line with
the national program to achieve self-sufficiency in food.
</P>
<P>
He said the estimated demand this year stands at 8.7 million
tons of crop, adding that 600,000 tons of crop will be surplus
other than the 2.4 million tons set aside for fodder and seed.
</P>
<P>
He further said the average annual consumption for an
individual which was estimated to be 120 kgs two years ago has
now grown to 150 kgs of crop.
</P>
<P>
The boost in production indicates that the country could
achieve self-sufficiency in food in less time than assumed, the
minister said, adding that the next thing to tackle will be
assuring food-security at the family level.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned About Taiwan's Disposal of Nuke Waste in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman
said here today that China is "highly concerned" about the
reported Taiwan attempt to stockpile some nuclear waste in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
it was reported that recently the Taiwan authorities had
publicly admitted having reached an agreement with the DPRK on
stockpiling some nuclear waste from Taiwan on the territory of the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about this matter at a weekly press
conference, Spokesman Shen Guofang said the action which the
Taiwan authorities have taken on their disposal of nuclear waste
"is nothing but a concrete demonstration of their attempts to
creat 'two Chinas' or 'one china one taiwan.'"
</P>
<P>
"This action is designed to undermine the relations between
China and the country concerned and continue presenting obstacles
to the improvement and development of the relations across the
Taiwan Strait," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are strongly against this
move by the Taiwan authorities," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"What is more," Shen noted, "the disposal of nuclear waste is
something subject to exacting technical requirements. Any
mishandling or accident would cause environmental pollution to the
surrounding countries and regions." The Chinese side is therefore
highly concerned about this matter, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Container Transportation through Eurasia Continental Bridge Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lianyungang, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese seaport at the
eastern end of one of the world's longest land bridges has
reported a 47-fold increase in its container traffic.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang in east China's Jiangsu Province handled 12,118
international containers through the Eurasia Continental Bridge in
1996.
</P>
<P>
From Lianyungang to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, the
continental rail link stretches for 10,900 kilometers. It passes
through over 40 countries and regions and connects the Pacific
Ocean with the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The New Eurasia Continental Bridge was first put into use on
September 12, 1990, when a railway in northwest China was linked
to a railway in Kazakhstan, bridging a missing link in a
continuous railway.
</P>
<P>
The bridge has shortened the journey distance from the Far East
to Western Europe by 15,000 compared with sea route by the Cape of
Good Hope. It is even 8,000 kilometers less than a sea route that
takes a short cut through the Suez Canal in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Governments of countries along the bridge have showed great
interest in the bridge, which now has become an important link in
promoting international trade.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang City has attracted many international corporations
to the city. Many have researched business opportunities or probed
ways of utilizing the bridge.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy overseas customers, Lianyungang has improved its
service for container transportation and simplized customs
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The cargo transported through the bridge has turned from
one-way to dual-way and diversified, from machinery to chemicals,
electronics, light industry and agricultural products.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Holiday Time in Leper House of Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leprosy has prevailed in Tibet for 1,400 years, said a
government public health official. In the past no medical
treatment had ever been given to lepers. But to make matters worse
sufferers were branded as wickedly cursed, being "punished by
gods" or as "compensation for his ancestor's sins."
</P>
<P>
Usually victims of the illness were once buried alive by their
own families, or forced into exile in primeval forests to lead an
inhumane life. Officials and nobles in old Tibet thought it a bad
omen in life to come across a leper.
</P>
<P>
Dazim said the party and governments has set great store by the
prevention and treatment of leprosy, and made remarkable progress
to help fight the illness.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, 3,468 lepers have been found in the
whole autonomous region, and 3,128 of them have totally
recovered. And the occurrence rate of the disease has now dropped
to 36 cases per million people.
</P>
<P>
"There are only 89 lepers today in Tibet," Dazim said,
promising that "the party and government of the autonomous region
are stepping up efforts to eradicate completely the disease by
providing intensive medical care. Be confident and optimistic,"
he urged.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the patients, Dazim, Yang Song and others
presented butter, meat and brick tea to the hospital. Two
patients who set out of hospital to start new lives in the
community each received 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars) in
settlement fees from the civil affairs department of the
autonomous region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Holiday Time in Leper House of Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The hospital's surroundings were
idyllic, set in a mountain valley a few kilometers from Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Today Jiangqu Hospital was a hive of activity as patients rose
early to give the place a top-to-bottom spring clean. They
decorated their rooms with colorful flags and banners containing
Tibetan Buddhist scripts.
</P>
<P>
An unusual event was to take place at the hospital - the
patients were to welcome visitors. Normally visitors give the
place a wide berth, mainly out of fear and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
Jiangqu Hospital is a leper colony, home to sufferers of
chronic infection that can distort the body.
</P>
<P>
The leprosy sufferers greeted the traditional Chinese Spring
Festival and the Tibetan New Year alongside leaders of the Tibetan
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Mid morning saw a start to the celebrations as Dazim, deputy
secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, led a group of officials to the 31-year-old
hospital. The patients gave a rapturous applause as the visitors
arrived.
</P>
<P>
It was Dazim's tenth annual visit to the leprosarium to
celebrate the most important Han and Tibetan festivals with the
patients.
</P>
<P>
Dazim remembered the names of some of the patients as he
presented hadas to them, which in Tibet signal auspicious wishes.
</P>
<P>
"Leprosy can be prevented, treated and is nothing to be afraid
of, are you confident with yourselves," Dazim asked the patients
as he and Yang Song, vice-chairman of the Tibet autonomous
regional government, sat alongside dozens lepers.
</P>
<P>
Some nodded in agreement, others had tear-filled eyes.
</P>
<P>
Dazim turned to the officials behind him and said that "society
should abolish its fears of leprosy, as well as the prejudice
against lepers, and people should care for lepers just as they
care for all other patients."
</P>
<P>
One patient failed to hold back his tears, and sobbed, "The
party and the government never look down upon us. The deputy party
secretary has come so often to see us in hospital, and when our
disease is cured, the government takes good care of us and helps
us to become employed."
</P>
<P>
"But if we were still under the old serf system of forty years
ago, there would not be a day when we could lift our heads,"
another leper, aged around 60, said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has ordered the police
and other security agencies to deal firmly with criminals to
promote its private sector-driven economy, a local newspaper said
today.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa made the directive in an
address to his ministry's annual performance review workshop at
Kafue River Motel, 50 kilometers from Lusaka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying that private
investment and reinvestment in the economy could not be achieved
without a secure environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that "my ministry will not condone promotion of an
environment which is not conducive to economic development."
</P>
<P>
Sampa told the police to act against the few agitators of
violence regardless of their status in society.
</P>
<P>
He warned the people involved in fomenting disturbances that
they are playing in deep and dangerous waters.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should molest the police. The police is government
itself and whoever refuses to be summoned, force must be used.
This is not a joke and I mean business," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Farm Trade Suffers $9 Billion Deficit in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in
the agricultural and forestry sectors has increased sharply in
recent years due to the ever widening trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said
today that the country's import of agricultural and forestry
products amounted to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars last year, while
the export of related goods remained at only 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance stood at nine billion U.S. dollars, representing
44 percent of South Korea's total trade deficit of 20.4 billion
U.S. dollars for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
The agro-forestry trade imbalance, which stood at 6.53 billion
U.S. dollars in 1994, widened to 7.33 billion U.S. dollars in 1995
and further expanded to nine billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ever rising deficit is attributable to the increasing
influx of agricultural products from foreign countries with the
wider opening of the domestic market under the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's import of foreign agricultural and forestry
products are expected to increase further as the nation is set to
further open markets for 34 related goods such as chicken, pork
and oranges as from July this year.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the export of related products soars in line with the
import growth, the country's trade imbalance is certain to
increase drastically this year," the official noted.

<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) agreed today that a
neutral third party will monitor the implementation of a truce in
Buldon, Mindanao, following reports of violations of the agreement
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the utilization of a third party to oversee
the truce was reached by government and MILF negotiators in
Mindanao, the official Philippine News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The third party will be composed of non-government
organizations, peace advocates and the local media, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the government and MILF negotiators as saying
that the agreement will be finally approved when the government
and MILF committees on the cessation of hostilities meet on
February 9.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the government and the MILF reached the ceasefire
agreement for Buldon, Maguindanao province, where recent
skirmishes resulted in the death of four government soldiers and
32 MILF rebels. The conflict also forced 2,000 families to
evacuate from the Buldon region.
</P>
<P>
However, after the two sides signed the peace agreement,
government troops and MILF rebels still hurled accusations against
each other for alleged violations of the truce.

<HEADLINE> HK Fire Services Prepares for Handover Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Fire Services
Department (FSD) has set up a working group to oversee and
safeguard fire safety at the handover ceremony and related
celebrations to be held during the summer months, a senior FSD
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Peter Cheung, director of the
department, said that fire officers will initiate inspections and
survey to hotels, guest houses and restaurants where large numbers
of people will assemble for such activities to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deployment of fire and ambulance services to
major locations will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
According to CSD, with approaching Hong Kong's transfer in the
middle of this year, the FSD is making arrangements for the
replacement of the existing badge of the department.
</P>
<P>
The new service badge has adopted elements featured by the
Bauhinia symbol, a torch on a pair of fireman axes in the badge.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that his department will continue to maintain close
contacts with the Chinese mainland in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Last year three delegations of the FSD visited various fire
brigades in Guangdong and Hainan provinces, while a total of 35
fire officers from the Chinese mainland visited the department.
</P>
<P>
A group of 10 senior fire officials selected by the Chinese
Ministry of Public Security underwent a 4-week attachment to the
FSD last November on fire protection and operation work of the
department.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that more exchange visits between the two sides are
 expected to be paid later this year so as to enhance the
cooperation between fire brigades of the Chinese mainland and
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> No Surprises About Copyrights in China for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Shen Rengan, deputy director of
China's State Copyright Administration, told a press conference in
Beijing today that the pressure from copyright problems eased a
bit after the country seized 26 underground production lines
alleged to be producing illegal CDs last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there may be no stunning news in the area of
copyrights this year. Some other good news he mentioned was: a
decrease in the price of authorized CDs, improvement of the
public's copyright awareness, and the international community's
recognization of China's copyright protection achievements.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China and the United States narrowly avoided a trade
war, sparked by the copyright issue, at the very last minute, and
Shen noted that his staff can at last "have a breathing spell".
</P>
<P>
There is still a lot of work to do in 1997, however. The return
of Hong Kong to the motherland will force copyright workers to
think about broader issues, such as the connection of Hong Kong's
copyright law (based on the Berne Convention) with the Copyright
Law of the People's Republic of China, said Xu Chao, the
administration's legal expert.
</P>
<P>
Xu explained that the country will revise its six-year-old
copyright law to meet the changing society's needs, particularly,
those of the electronic information era.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huapeng, head of the administration's Copyright
Department, also pointed out that the fight against copyright
infringement will not stop, noting that "As for illegal products
confiscated by the authorities, only 10 percent were pornographic
materials. The rest were mainly pirated ones."
</P>
<P>
Piracy not only violates copyright holders' rights, but also
hiders further development of the country's booming publishing
industry, Wang said, "A one-million-yuan investment in publishing
industry disappears because of piracy."
</P>
<P>
A lot of cases will be handled this year, and a copyright
protection center will be created, he said, adding that the
administration will oversee the work of foreign copyright agencies
in China. And China will develop a new regulation on increasing
writers' profits this year, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The copyright is an unchanging melody in China. There will be
nothing new in this regard," Shen Rengan concluded, but noted,
"What we intend to do is to make arrangements better and more
practical, but without the interference of any outside pressure."

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The world athletics
governing body IAAF has paid Olympic double champion Michael
Johnson about $70,000 U.S. dollars to resolve a dispute with
British officials who banned the American from running in Britain
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here on Wednesday, Johnson's
agent Brad Hunt said in Raleigh, North Carolina, that the money
and the recent resignation of British Athletic Federation (BAF)
executive chairman Peter Radford, who was strongly criticised for
Johnson's banning from the race at Crystal Palace last July, may
lead to Johnson running in Britain this summer.
</P>
<P>
The payment to Johnson followed Hunt's complaint to the IAAF
after British officals had dropped Johnson from the 400-meter
race, saying his participation would be demoralising to British
runners so close to the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The (International Amateur Athletic Federation) paid the
amount of money that Michael would have earned by running the
race," Hunt was quoted as saying.

KAMPALA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has re-sealed
Uganda-Zaire border entry at Goli, due to rush by Ugandan traders
to Mahagi town in Zaire, which was captured by the Banyamulenge
rebels, reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan authorities closed the border last time in
September 1996.
</P>

A local official was quoted as saying that the capture of
Mahagi by the rebels generated a lot of excitement not only among
traders but also in Ugandans who for years feared to visit their
kinsmen across the border.
</P>
<P>
For two weeks a new market at Asina inside Zaire drained all
shops and markets in Nebbi District (bordering Zaire) of all
goods, forcing prices of consumer goods to go up.
</P>
<P>
The border was reportedly closed on the order of Tumusiime,
commander of the government army in charge of Nebbi District.
</P>
<P>
According to the order, vehicles are banned to the border
areas. However, pedestrians and cyclists are allowed to cross the
border.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Earns 9 Million Dollars From Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tobacco Association of
Zambia (TAZ) earned over nine million US Dollars for the country
by increasing tobacco exports last year, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted TAZ President Arsene Van Ginkel
as attributing the big earning to the export development program
(EDP) facility of 1.5 million Dollars secured from the European
Union to boost tobacco production in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
With the EDP facility, the TAZ increased crop production from
1.5 million kilograms of tobacco to three million kilograms last
year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in tobacco production has brought to life the
recently privatized tobacco processing plant which stopped
operation in 1992, since when Zambia's tobacco has been exported
in green leaf form to be processed in Malawi and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The TAZ is planning to increase the processing plant's
workforce from the current 250 employees to 700.
</P>
<P>
The TAZ is also sourcing two million US Dollars from donor
agencies on affordable terms of repayment over a three to four
year period to assist members to finance infrastructural
investments so as to expand tobacco production.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in China's ethnic
Lijiang area who suffered a strong earthquake and a hailstorm last
year have reaped a good agricultural harvest.
</P>
<P>
The county gathered 132,000 tons of grain and beans last year,
3,695 tons more than the previous year's figure, representing an
almost three percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Its revenue generated from the rural economy increased by 10
percent to 386 million yuan last year. Farmers' annual net income
was 679 yuan per capita, 1.9 percent up from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The area suffered a double blow during the past year. It was
hit by an earthquake measuring seven on the Richter scale on
February 3, in which 228 people were killed and 3,700 seriously
injured. Then three months later a rarely-seen hailstorm and flood
damaged crops on 14,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with ruined homelands, local people, led by
governments at various levels, built more grain bases, applied
agro-science in agriculture and improved field management. Now
they have reaped their rewards with a good harvest.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's DP Welcomes Mandela-Leon Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party (DP)
of South Africa has given the thumbs up to continued negotiation
between its party leader Tony Leon and President Nelson Mandela
on a possible role in the Government of National Unity (GNU).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday after DP's
federal executive meeting, Leon said he would hold discussions
with Mandela at the earliest opportunity, reported a local daily
"The Citizen" today.
</P>
<P>
The DP is currently the second largest white political party
in opposition after the National Party withdrew from the GNU in
May last year to become the official opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Mandela had extended his offers to the DP
and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to join the GNU, led by the
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
The PAC had reportedly accepted Mandela's offer and agreed in
principle to join the ANC-led GNU.
</P>
<P>
Leon said, however, it would be "dangerous" if the GNU
comprised the three black political parties, the ANC, the Inkatha
Freedom Party and the PAC, while the majority white parties were
all in opposition.
</P>
<P>
"This would be a dangerous situation for South Africa, and go
towards increasing polarization and reduce the prospect of
non-racial realignment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Leon strongly denied that joining the GNU would
compromise the DP's stand on liberal principles, saying the DP
wants to get South Africa working in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on Mandela's offer to the DP, Leon said the
president made a positive and sincere approach to getting South
Africa on the road to economic growth and stability, and it would
be churlish to reject that out of hand.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the DP's response was also positive, he said,
adding "let us jointly seek a way to increase economic growth,
while maintaining our role as a watchdog".

<P>
NANJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A professor in Nanjing, the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, has invented a
solar-powered bicycle, which he uses as his major mode of
transportation daily.
</P>
<P>
Fan Binghe, a retired professor at Nanjing's Aviation and
Aerospace University, has been doing research in the field of
solar energy since 1983, and began working on the bicycle early
this year.
</P>
<P>
He spent 4,250 yuan (about 510 US dollars) converting an
electrically-powered bicycle into the solar-powered one.
</P>
<P>
It can go up to 25 kilometers per hour, and can run
continuously as long as the sun shines. If there is no sunlight,
it can be powered from a household electricity source, and a
five-hour charge will let it go a distance of 15 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian National Car Tops 1996 Passenger Car Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's national car
Proton dominated the local passenger car market in 1996 with sales
of 138,073 units or 50.1 percent of the total passenger car
market, according to the Malaysian Motor Traders Association
(MMTA) today.
</P>
<P>
But compared with 1995, the share of Proton models including
Wira, Iswara and Perdana, declined from 56.6 percent or 127,327
units sold, the MMTA said in its market review for 1996 at a press
conference at Petaling Jaya near the capital city.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a total of 275,615 passenger car units were sold,
representing 75.6 percent of total vehicle sales in the country,
but a slight drop compared with the 78.7 percent share it
controlled in the previous year, MMTA Chairman Aishah Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
Perodua, the second national car, maintained its second spot in
1996 with 4,6941 units sold or a market share of 17.0 percent,
marginally lower than 17.7 percent share in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Proton-DRB which markets the Satria, Wira Aeroback, Tiara and
Putra, saw its market share jump to 13.8 percent or 38,027 cars
from 5.9 percent or 13,320 units in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Aishah said the drop in, both, Proton's and Perodua's market
share was due to numerous new models offered by other vehicle
distributors as reflected by the total industry volume growth of
about 28 percent to 364,788 units.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the surge in Usahasama Proton-DRB market share
to the new models introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the non-national passenger cars, Honda retained its
fourth spot with a 6.6 percent market share in 1996 compared with
4.9 percent in 1995 while Toyota held its fifth ranking with a
share of 3.8 percent against 3.7 percent for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the non-national passenger car sales recorded 52,574
units last year, an increase of 19.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for 1997, MMTA forecast passenger car sales to
grow by eight percent to 297,664 units.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian, Croatian FMs Cautious on Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian and Croatian foreign
ministers have agreed that there is no need to institutionalize a
U.S.-proposed initiative for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ljubomir Frckovski, of Macedonia, and Mate Granich, of Croatia,
said cooperation between central and southeastern Europe could be
carried out on concrete programs without a designated institution.
</P>
<P>
The same format could apply to cooperation between eastern and
southern Europe, the two diplomats were quoted as saying by an
official news release from Skeplje, the capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Frckovski reached the consensus with Granich on Tuesday while
paying a visit to the Croatian capital of Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks about regional cooperation were referring to the
Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) tabled up by the
United States on December 6 at a meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Bosnia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova,
Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey reportedly agreed to join
the proposed group, termed as "apolitical" by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
However, critics in Croatia held that the U.S. goal behind the
initiative was to build a "United States of the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
During the Macedonian foreign minister's one-day stay in
Zagreb, he also consulted with his Croatian counterpart about
other regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed on the occasion an agreement on
consular services, and discussed the final drafts of agreements on
property protection, free trade and social security.

<HEADLINE> 1,384 Kilos of Drugs Burned in Yangon, Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities, at a
ceremony here today, set ablaze more than 1,384 kilograms of
narcotic drugs including 424 kilograms of heroin and 766
kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
At the 11th destruction ceremony, held by the Myanmar Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), also destroyed were
1,354 liters of phensedyl and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Police Major-General Soe Win, who is secretary of the CCDAC,
said at the ceremony that Myanmar is actively participating in the
drug control efforts in cooperation not only with neighboring
countries but also with those in the regions.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Myanmar is determined to continue its
endeavors against drug abuse even if such efforts and achievements
are not appreciated or no outside assistance is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's ceremonial destruction of narcotic drugs started in
1990 and up to now, more than 18,411 kilograms including 1,961
kilograms of heroin and 11,912 kilograms of opium have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former drug warlord Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army

BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Fossil fragments of upper and
lower jaws and teeth of a monkey-like animal have been found in
southern Thailand, which researchers believe to be some of the
earliest evidence of the evolution of higher primates.

The medium-sized monkey-like creatures weighing about six and
seven kilograms are believed to have lived about 40 million years

eocaenus, or "dawn ape from Thailand," according to a Bangkok Post
report quoting the Nature News Service.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives for National Re-consolidation: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has been
striving for national re-consolidation with all seriousness
regarding the underground groups as national brethren and no
strangers, said Myanmar leader Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC), made the remarks at the opening
ceremony of a management course for executives of the Union
Solidarity Development Association (USDA) in Hmawby of Yangon on
Wednesday, the official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe said, "Invitation was extended to underground
organizations so as to take them along by the hand, gladly
accepting them if they too would join in at such a time as the
present when special endeavors are being made for peace,
prosperity and development of the union."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed, "The government would go on extending
assistance, with full faith and mutual amity as fostered from the
very outset, to the national brethren who have come into the legal
fold and are now striving in accord with laws to further the
interests of their regions and their national races."
</P>
<P>
He also called on all people to "remove from among themselves
instigation" and "be clear of grudges rooted in what had happened
in the past."
</P>
<P>
Fifteen out of 16 ethnic armed groups in Myanmar have made
peace with the government since the SLORC took power in 1988,
leaving only the largest one, the Kayin National Union, still in
operation on the Myanmar-Thai border, in addition to some outlawed
underground political organizations.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims and Croats set up Joint Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's Croats and Muslims
have taken the final steps in merging their armies into one joint
army, two years after the U.S.-backed plan was put forward.
</P>
<P>
Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim chairman of the Bosnian three-man
presidency, and Kresimir Zubak, the Croat member of the
presidency, signed orders yesterday appointing the heads of the
federal army and establishing the chains of command.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced by James Pardew, American
ambassador to Bosnia charged by the White House with overseeing
the Muslim-Croat Federation's military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the commander of the former Muslim army,
General Rasim Delic, was named head of the joint army. The
commander of the former Croat army, Zivko Budimir, was named his
deputy and the chief-of-staff.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1994, Bosnia's Croats and Muslim factions signed an
agreement to set up the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and the
federal army. But the army was never set up because of differences
between the both sides.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to U.S. pressure, the federation recently passed a
Defense Law, stipulating the setting up a 35-thousand-soldier
joint army including three Muslim divisions and one Croat division.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also backing a 400 million U.S.-dollar
program, known as Train and Equip, to train and equip the
federation's army to make it an effective counterweight to the
army of the Serb republic in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Talk With U.S. Firm on Hydropower Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- High-level discussions are to
be held on Friday between the Nepali government and a large energy
company of the United States on proposed major hydropower projects
in Nepal, a senior Nepali official said today.
</P>
<P>
Water Resources Minister Pashupati Shumsher Rana was quoted by
local newspapers today as saying his ministry will hold talks with
officials of Enron Corp., the U.S. power conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, who Wednesday returned home from a
nine-day Europe tour aimed at attracting foreign investment for
Nepal's hydropower sector, the talks with Enron will be part of
the "solicitation process" which the government follows before
awarding contracts for large-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
The particular process calls for negotiations on a one-to-one
basis unlike the regular process under which global tenders are
invited, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. power giant had earlier expressed interest in
developing a 10,800-megawatt multi-purpose project in West Nepal
and the 402-megawatt Arun III project in East Nepal, which was
scrapped in 1995 due to the World Bank's withdrawal of its
financial support.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company late last year put forth its proposal of
investing about 9 billion U.S. dollars for the two major projects
on a build-operate-transfer basis to the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Water Resources Ministry here said the
American power company envisages exporting the generated
electricity to neighboring India and China.
</P>
<P>
They said the company is considering to construct high-voltage
transmission lines across the Himalayas and link up with the
nearest power grid in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, about
2,500 kilometers away from Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, water resources experts here have questioned the
economic feasibility of the Enron proposal, citing the
difficulties of slinging power lines over the Himalayas, the long
distance between Nepal and China's inland and the rapid power
sector development in China.

tightened the newsprint import policy by re-imposing the "actual
user" condition.
</P>
<P>
According to an official notification issued here on Wednesday,
the import of newsprint, which was hitherto freely importable by
all persons, shall be permitted subject to the actual user
condition only to such importers who hold a certificate for
entitlement to import newsprint, issued by the registrar of
newspapers for India.
</P>
<P>
The policy was intended to divert non-newspaper users from
newsprint imports and protect the domestic paper industry, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic demand for newsprint is currently around 645,000
tons, of which 65 percent is manufactured in the country.
According to the Indian Paper Makers Association, newsprint demand
increased from 510,000 tons to 630,000 tons in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the government's new move is only a temporary
measure and is expected to be lifted once anti-dumping
investigations are over.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Deputy FM Speak Against Interference in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia's First Deputy Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said today that interference in the internal
affairs of the Yugoslavian people is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of a three-day visit
here, the deputy minister noted that it is Yugoslavia's internal
affairs to resolve the current crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The international community, Ivanov said, should offer help
constructive to the solution of the problems in Yugoslavia rather
than intentionally escalating the tensions already there.
</P>
<P>
Russia sincerely hopes that the Yugoslavian people could
resolve the conflict through political dialogue as soon as
possible, said the Russian official, who is in charge of European
affairs.
</P>
<P>
His country is against the policy of isolating the Yugoslavian
government and is willing to contribute to the stability of the
country and its surrounding areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Ivanov met with senior government
officials including President Slobodan Milosevic, and with leaders
of various political parties including those in opposition.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hesitant About Aviation Cooperation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is hesitant to open
flights under an aviation cooperation program in the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) as the
country's national carrier has doubts about their profitability.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said Thai Airways International (THAI)
has claimed it would suffer losses from the flights due to the
size of the market.
</P>
<P>
The airline faces difficulties in operating short flights
because of high operating costs, the newspapers quoted Thai
Transport and Communications Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will allow local private airlines to
fly as an alternative under its commitment to an agreement on
IMT-GT aviation cooperation signed by the three countries in April
1995.
</P>
<P>
Officials from THAI complained that for economic cooperation
between Thailand and its neighboring countries, the airline has
been pressured to fly to various destinations despite losses.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia reportedly have operated fights linking
various destinations in the three countries under the pact.

ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tansu Ciller said here today that
Turkey will apply to join the European Union (EU) again.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with foreign ministers of Italy, Britain, France,
Germany and Spain, Ciller said that Turkey should in no way be
rejected by EU.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he will hand in Turkey's application
during the EU summit in Amsterdam when Netherlands acts as
president of the 15-member block.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini noticed
that there are still obstacles to Turkey's efforts to enter EU,
"however, Ankara has promised to try its best to overcome them."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind said that Turkey
should be treated equally with other countries applying for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Ciller who arrived here Tuesday added that Turkey will veto
NATO's eastwards expansion plan if its EU aspirations get
frustrated this time.

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Further Drops Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The continued rapid
appreciation of the U.S. dollar has led speculators to dump more
Thai baht for the dollar, as the mid-rate registered the highest
since mid-1990.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand's Exchange Equalization Fund, which is
responsible for fixing the baht's daily exchange rates, on
Wednesday set the rate to the dollar at 25.86 baht, from 25.81 on
Tuesday. The new rate was the highest since June 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the offshore spot markets, the dollar was traded at around
25.92 baht, 6 satang higher than the official mid-rate.
</P>
<P>
In the swap market, the six-month contract quoted the dollar at
26.40 baht, higher than 26.25 on the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said investors dumped the baht for speculative
purposes while others believed that investors feared that the
country may face its first budget deficit in nine years in fiscal
1997, which ends on September 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay Virawan, deputy prime minister in charge of financial
matters, came out to soothe the money market by assuring it that
the Thai baht remained stable despite its rapid depreciation
against the dollar and that the current high exchange rate will
not lower Thailand's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fanned by the weak baht, stock prices at the Stock
Exchange of Thailand on Wednesday suffered the biggest single-day
loss of 28.24 points, or 3.4 percent, in four weeks, to close at
814.39.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Murders Linked to Serial Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States FBI
said today that a serial killer could be responsible for
about 20 murders which have kept Costa Rican police guessing for
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
help come up with a psychological profile of the killer, known
as "the psychopath," who is believed to be responsible for a
series of murders over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Alvarado, director of the Judicial Investigation Body,
said that the FBI had confirmed the Costa Rican police's
suspicions that the crimes were all committed by the same person.
</P>
<P>
The killings all bore similar characteristics - all were couples
and the female partner was attacked in a particularly cruel way.
</P>
<P>
All the murders occurred in the same city, around the same
time, during full moons and against the same kind of victims,
usually couples who parked their cars in isolated spots.
</P>
<P>
The latest murder occurred last October when the bodies of a
couple were found buried a few meters away from their car.
</P>
<P>
The weapon used, the victims' wounds, and the way in which the
bodies were left could help to identify the killer, Alvarado
said.

<HEADLINE> Colombo Mayor Resigns to Lead Independents in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Mayor K. Ganeshalingam of
Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, resigned Wednesday evening from the
country's main opposition United National Party (UNP) and
announced his intention to lead a group of independents at the
forthcoming local government elections, according to informed
sources today.
</P>
<P>
Ganeshalingam won his seat in Colombo's Municipal Council as a
candidate of the UNP in 1990 and became mayor of the
UNP-controlled council in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He served as the treasurer of the UNP for many years.
</P>
<P>
Ganeshalingam's decision to quit the UNP and run for office as
an independent followed the UNP's announcement that its candidate
for the office of mayor of Colombo on this occasion would be the
party's chairman, Karu Jayasuriya.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he resigned from his post as UNP treasurer, the
sources quoted Ganeshalingam as replying that "I will disclose it
at the right time."
</P>
<P>
The sources said he was resigning to lead a group of
independents to contest for the office of mayor of Colombo. The
group will be supported by the ruling People's Alliance and its
constituent members including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the
Ceylon Workers' Congress and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress who are
unlikely to contest with him and his independent group.
</P>
<P>
He is also expecting the support of other minority Tamil
parties such as the Tamil United Liberation Front, the Eelam
People's Democratic Party and the Eelam Revolutionary Organization
of Students, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government Monday dissolved local government
bodies and declared that local elections are to be held on March
27 this year. Nominations will be accepted from February 5 to 12.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and Australian Swimmers Set World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese teenager Han Xue
and Australian swimmer Michael Klim set new world records
Wednesday at the World Cup swimming short-course meeting in
Glascow.
</P>
<P>
Han, 15, timed 30.88 seconds in the 50 meters breaststroke,
improving her own mark, set in Beijing in January, by one-tenthes
of a second.
</P>
<P>
Han sprined strongly away from her rivals and beat Britain's
Jaime King to second. King clocked in at 32.11 seconds, followed
by Canadian Tara Sloan, 32.37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Klim swam within an ace of another in a lively final session in
the British leg of the World Cup, slicing 0.02 seconds off the
world record in the men's 100 meters butterfly. The old mark was
set by Canadian Marcel Gery in February 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Klim's new world record is 52.09 seconds, a whisker ahead
of Britain's Jame Hickman, who set a new Europran record with a
time of 52.34 seconds. German Fabian Hieronimus finished third in
53.40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Klim's victory of the meeting was extended to four after this
triumph. His other three titles were the 200- and 100-meter
freestyle and 50-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Australian also dominated Wednesday's 200
meters freestyle in 1:46.62.
</P>
<P>
Australia was the most prolific winner with 11 golds in the 34
events of the two-day tournament.
</P>
<P>
Klim's four triumphs were backed by a superb hat-trick of
freestyle golds for 14-year-old Natasha Bowron, who won
Wednesday's 400 meters after Tuesday's 200 and 800 victories.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Australians Adrian Radley and Matthew Dunn completed
respective doubles in backstroke and individual medley.
</P>
<P>
Han capped an impressive competitions in the two days meeting
for Chinese women swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Limin, double long-course world champion, swam a formidably
strong 200 butterfly in 2:06.85 after swimming the second-fastest
women's short-course 100 butterfly ever on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Lu Bin took Tuesday's 50 backstroke but was
denied a golden double by disqualification for illegally kicking
at the first turn. She later finished third in the 100 meters
individual medley.
</P>
<P>
The next World Cup event is in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on
Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Riot Rocks West Kalimantan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of about 40
unidentified men Wednesday went on a burning rampage in Siantan
Tengah District of Indonesia's West Kalimantan Province, damaging
a foundation that runs Catholic schools, a press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post reported the riot began at around 3:40 a.m.
when the men attacked the office of the Karya Sosial Pancur Kasih
Foundation, burning a truck and two motorcycles within the
compound.
</P>
<P>
The rioters smashed window panes and threw Molotov cocktails at
the motorcycles and trucks. They vandalized the office's
electrical facilities while retreating.
</P>
<P>
The report said the men wearing masks broke into a boarding
house near the foundation, slashing two women with sickles and
sending terrified occupants to the attic.
</P>
<P>
The attack forced the foundation's officials to close for a day
the St. Fransiskus Asisi junior and senior high schools, which
have 773 students, for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities in West Kalimantan were not available for
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say if any arrest had been made.
</P>
<P>
Security officers were seen guarding the school in anticipation
of further unrest.
</P>
<P>
This was the second riot in West Kalimantan within a month. An
ethnically motivated clash took place on December 30, last year,
between Madura immigrants and Dayak natives in Sanggau ledo. Five
people were killed and 21 others went missing in that incident.

<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The ratio of cars bought by
individuals at Beijing's biggest auto mart in the past year
exceeded that of cars bought by institutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time private car sales have been more than
vehicles acquired officially, according to statistics provided by
the Asian Games Village Auto Market, the largest one in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The market's total sales in 1996 was 11,106 automobiles in
1996, among which 47 percent were bought by individuals, and the
monthly ratio topped 60 percent in the later half year.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars bought by individuals has experienced a
sharp increase in China in recent years, with an annual growth
rate of more than 50 percent, statistics shows.
</P>
<P>
China's total number of privately-owned autos has reached more
than 2.5 million, and more than 80 percent of medium-sized trucks
manufactured in China in recent years have been bought by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that by the year 2000, the China's auto
market will largely depend on demand from private
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Remains Active </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Mount Merapi, one of
Indonesia's most active volcanoes, was still showing signs of
volcanic activity on Wednesday, producing 62 tremors and 49
magmatic avalanches, local volcanological officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mas Atje, head of the Mount Merapi observation section of the
Directorate of Volcanology in Yogyakarta, said Wednesday that the
volcano was still in a "ready status," the Antara News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter-high volcano, located on the border of Central
Java and Yogyakarta, erupted on January 17, forcing the evacuation
of some 15,000 villagers. Last week, all of the evacuees returned
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
There was no official news on casualties but unconfirmed
reports said six people went missing when the Merapi erupted.
</P>
<P>
Atje said magmatic avalanches were still seen flowing over a
distance of kilometers toward the Krasak, Bebeng, Sat and Boyong
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Although the volcano no longer spewed heat clouds, he said,
people, particularly those living along the rivers, have to remain
ready for a recurrence of the clouds.
</P>
<P>
People have also been told to be ready for a possible flood of
lava as rainfall around the top of the mountain was still high.
</P>
<P>
The last major eruption of the Merapi occurred in 1994, sending
massive heat clouds all over the area, killing 69 people and
leaving 5,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 17,500 islands are dotted by about 500 volcanoes,
127 of which are active.

<HEADLINE> Crimean Parliament Passes No-Confidence Vote in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The parliament in Ukraine's
autonomous Crimean Republic passed a no-confidence motion in the
republic's government and the prime minister on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the present government will stop
functioning when a Council of Ministers, the new name of the
government under a law passed by parliament earlier this month, is
formed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Crimean parliament asked its Speaker Vasily
Kiselev to hold talks with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on
sacking Crimean Prime Minister Arkady Demidenko.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma has already said he opposes parliament's attempts to get
rid of the government.
</P>
<P>
Demidenko has refused to step down and at a press conference
after the decision condemned the motion as unlawful. He threatened
to appeal to the Ukrainian parliament to dissolve the Crimean
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on parliament's resolution on Wednesday, Kiselev
said it "could be a serious mistake," and "an apparent challenge
to the president."
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time in three years that the autonomous
Crimean parliament, which is mainly pro-Russian, has voted to
bring down the government which is backed by President Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, the Crimean parliament adopted a no-confidence
motion which called for the government to step down and a new one
to be formed by February 5.
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the motion was put forward in line with the new
Ukrainian constitution approved last June which said a new Council
of Ministers should be formed to replace the present government.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the move was aimed at expanding the power of
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma declared the motion invalid and handed the case to the
Ukrainian Constitutional Court for further investigation. Reports
said the court is expected to declare the resolution
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Crimean parliament and the Ukrainian central authorities
have long been in dispute over the autonomous status of Crimea,
which used to be part of Russia and whose 2.7 million population
is mostly made up of ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
The republic was part of russia for nearly two centuries but
was incorporated into Ukraine by the Soviet authorities in
1954. It has threatened several times to secede since Ukraine
gained independence in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Panama Denies Negotiations With U.S. Over Military Bases </HEADLINE>

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President
Ernesto Perez Balladares denied today that he was negotiating with
the United States on extending the presence of U.S. military bases
in the Caribbean country beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares made it clear that Panama would not sign any
agreement allowing the U.S. Southern Command stationed on the
banks of the Panama Canal to overstay.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares said, however, that there had been an exchange
of ideas by his nation with Washington and other Latin American
countries for creating a multinational antidrug center, possibly
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the U.S. military from Panama is due on
December 31, 1999 as set by the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties
signed between Panama and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy in Panama attributed the alleged
statement that the two countries were negotiating the permanent
stay of the bases to a journalistic misinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
Southern Command spokesman David Hunt asserted that the U.S.
military forces would withdraw from Panama on schedule.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi discussed today with visiting Finnish President Marrti
Ahtisaari about the progress of the European Union's (EU)
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish leader said he hoped the IGC would "complete its
tasks within the time allotted."
</P>
<P>
IGC, started last March in Italy's Turin, is scheduled to end
in June 1997 when its last session is held in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed to update and amend the Maastricht
Treaty on political and economic integration of the EU.
</P>
<P>
As for the bilateral cooperation, Ahtisaari said the two
countries had "cooperated successfully."
</P>
<P>
He thanked Italy for its backing on Baltic aid and said his
country was "very interested in cooperation with Mediterranean
nations."
</P>
<P>
"We believed the same set of principles govern Baltic and
Mediterranean cooperation," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Prodi agreed, saying "Italy is interested in a Europe that is
well-balanced between north and south."
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari arrived here Tuesday for a three-day state visit. He
will make a brief tour to Sicily Thursday before flying back to

<HEADLINE> Poland Adopts Document on Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government adopted a
document entitled "state integration strategy" Tuesday in a bid to
speed up its entry into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The document sets out the purpose and way of Poland's joining
the EU, the New Europe News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Joining the EU is Poland's strategic goal", the document said,
adding that the government plans to begin negotiations with the
EU from early next year and conclude talks by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
To join the EU, Poland must maintain high economic growth,
reform the social security system and financial institutions and
adjust its legal and economic system to suit the laws and
regulations practised in the EU, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said the document
was an important first step towards joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is happy about joinging the EU. Deputy prime
minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, who belongs to the Polish Peasant
Party, has opposed the document. He says that the benefits of
joining the EU will come at the cost of its agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Poland established ties with the EC in 1988. It became an
associate member in February 1994 and formally applied to join the
EU two months later.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes Joint Committee on Relics' Return to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia has proposed to
establish a joint committee to work on the return of Hungary's
historic relics, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a
letter addressed to his Hungarian counterpart Goncz Arpad, was
considered here a concession to Hungary's demand.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet Union allegedly took away "a great number" of
cultural treasures from Hungary in the 1940s, when the latter was
defeated together with Nazi Germany in the World War II.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the former Soviet bloc member has repeatedly
urged Russia to return the relics.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia's State Duma, or the lower house of the
parliament, categorically rejected the east European nation's
request by adopting a resolution last July.
</P>
<P>
The Russian stance on the dispute was softened recently after
the Federation Council, or the upper house of the legislature,
overruled the Duma's resolution.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Fails to Meet Budget Surplus Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government failed
to meet its 17.5 billion pesos (667 million U.S. dollars)
budgetary surplus target for 1996, with its actual surplus
reaching only 6.3 billion pesos (240 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The failure to realize the surplus target was attributed mainly
to the lower-than-expected revenue collections of the government
in 1996, Manila Bulletin said today.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue collections reached 410.4 billion pesos (15.6
billion dollars) in 1996, far below the expected level of 431.3
billion pesos (15.7 billion dollars), Assistant Finance Secretary
Gil Beltran was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Beltran, lower-than-expected receipts from the
government's privatization program also contributed to the
below-target financial standing of the government.
</P>
<P>
Incomes from privatization last year stood at only 5.6 billion
pesos (213 million dollars), significantly short of the target of
37.4 billion pesos (1.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 1996 budgetary surplus was the lowest cash position the
government has registered in the past three years, compared with
16.3 billion pesos (622 million dollars) in 1994 and 11.2 billion
pesos (427 million dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Far From Favorable to Central America: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is irreversible
but its consequences are far from being totally favorable for
Central American countries, former Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto warned today.
</P>
<P>
"Central America is going to have to make enormous efforts to
join that process," Madrigal cautioned, saying that the democracy
in Central America is frail and vulnerable to the negative
consequences of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Madrigal, president of the Foreign Service Foundation for Peace
and Democracy (FUNPADEM), gave the warning on the eve of a two-day
FUNPADEM seminar, where public officials and representatives of
the private sector and academies from Central America and the
United States will study prospects for the isthmus countries
within the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) due to start in the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican official said Brazil and the United States
were doing what they could to promote integration within the
regional blocs they are already a part of.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is determined that the integration process be made with
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) bloc, comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay with Chile being an
associate member.
</P>
<P>
But the United States is more interested in integration with
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of which Mexico
and Canada are also members.

<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zones Growing Moderately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Gross domestic product in
China's five special economic zones, including the cities of
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen and the island province of
Hainan, grew 14.3 percent in 1996, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based paper quoted Xu Yaping, deputy
director-general of the State Council's Special Economic Zone
Office as saying that, the conclusion is based on comparing last
year's expansion with the explosive growth of more than 50 percent
in the late 1980s and about 25 percent in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The five zones garnered 218.5 billion yuan (26.3 billion US
dollars) in total GDP last year, with their year-on-year growth
leading the national average by almost five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that exports combining hit 30.9 billion US dollars in
1996, up 3.4 percent over 1995. Overseas funding attracted to the
zones rose 5.6 percent to six billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Special economic zones used to boom on the merit of their
geographic advantages and policy incentives.
</P>
<P>
Following China's overhaul of its trade and investment
policies over the last few years, two privileged policies
remain: granting 15 percent income taxs for foreign investment
projects and tax-free treatment for capital goods imported to
build the zones' infrastructure. Still, the latter will be phased
out by 2000, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the zones were able to retain sound growth by
taking great pains to adapt to the policy changes, optimizing
their investment climate and honing their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen remained the envy of other zones with its GDP up 16.4
percent to 11.4 billion US dollars, according to China Business
Times. GDP in the neighbouring special economic zone of Zhuhai
grew 8.9 percent from 1995, below the national average.
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of booming economic growth, per capita
income of the zones' residents has greatly improved. per capita
income in Shenzhen averaged 1,800 US dollars last year. In the
runner-up city of Zhuhai, people earned an average of 1,358 US
dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show the special economic zones are emerging
matured economies and able to stand market competition on economic
advantages they have gradually built since their inception, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Suburban Firms to Get More Technicians (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's suburban township
enterprises will recruit more technical staff and managers while
developing technology-intensive and high value-added products this
year, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Beijing municipal government, the First Talent
and Property Exchange Fair for Beijing Suburban Rural Enterprises
will be held at the Beijing International Conference Center at the
end of March, according to a senior official with the local
government.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that more than 1,700 firms will attend the fair
and 327 of them plan to hire 1,500 technicians and managers during
the three-day fair, said Wang Zuosheng, a standing vice-director
of the Beijing municipal government's Agriculture and Forestry
Office.
</P>
<P>
"The fair will help rural industries improve their management
and product quality by enhancing their techniques and attracting
more talented people from other sectors and graduates from
universities," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Rural industries, which have burgeoned in the past 19 years,
have played a crucial role in Beijing's economic refrom and
development.
</P>
<P>
From 1978-1995, total output of township industries increased
at an average rate of 25.7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rural industries continued the growth by generating
40 percent of the city's total industrial output, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, township enterprises have provided jobs for 875,000
surplus rural laborers in the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprise employees account for 64 percent of the
total suburban labor force.

<P>
However, rural industries face a strategic shift in switching
from the old mode of "extensive growth," depending solely on
capital construction, to that of "intensive growth," achieved
through upgrading of managerial and production skills.
</P>
<P>
"The mode of intensive growth or scale economy usually requires
a better use of capital, resources and technology as well as
talent," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that there are 117,000 technicians and managers
in Beijing's rural industrial firms or 12.9 percent of the total
employees, eight percentage points less than in State-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels began to adopt effective measures to
vitalize the rural industries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 township firms finished their realignment last
year, including leasing, selling, acquiring and merging several
small rural firms into a large conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
This year, holdings, leases, mergers, auctions and other
approaches will be adopted to modernize the enterprises'
operations while attracting more skilled people to suburban
enterprises, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises also hope to attract more overseas
investment by setting up joint ventures or co-operative firms.

<HEADLINE> New Garden Home For Rare Plants in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Work has started on a new
botanical park in central China's Hubei Province to protect rare
and endangered plant species in the reservoir area near the Three
Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The Haiyun Botanical Park will cover an area of 6,967 hectares,
and will be the largest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
say that the water level in the area will rise by 175 meters
when the massive hydro-power project is completed. Some rare
and endangered plants would then be submerged.
</P>
<P>
Due to its special natural conditions, such as a complicated
geological status, landform, soil and climate, the Three Gorges
area became a safe haven for plants to avoid the onslaught of
glaciers in the Quaternary Ice Age, according to an expert.
</P>
<P>
Among the 54 species of rare and endangered plants growing in
the area, 36 are indigenous, such as the metasequoia.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the few countries which are the most
diversified in terms of plants, while the Three Gorges area is one
of the most important nature reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to salvage the plants facing extinction during
the early phase of the project, according to officials at the
Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to protecting the endangered plants, the garden
will be a research and breeding center to cultivate rare
species to be introduced from foreign countries, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up the botanical garden came from the late
Zhu Kezhen, a late renowned scientist, who was then responsible
for mapping out a national program on the development of
plantations. Yichang was designated as an ideal place for the park
because of the its typical ecological environment similar to the
dam area of the Three Gorges project.

refuted speculation that the country would join NATO, the western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Genady Udovenko said Ukraine has no intention of giving up its
status as a non-aligned country and joining the organization.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Ukraine hopes to develop its relationship with
the U.S.-led alliance.
</P>
<P>
The country also sees the normalization of relations with
Russia, which opposes NATO's planned eastward expansion, and
improved cooperation as a top foreign policy priority.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko warned there was a danger that NATO's eastward
expansion to take in countries which formerly belonged to the now
defunct Warsaw Pact could split Europe.
</P>
<P>
That situation should be avoided by the construction of a
pan-European security structure, Udovenko said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that NATO's promise not to deploy nuclear weapons
on the territories of new member states was a victory for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about ties between Russia and NATO, Udovenko said he
supports increased cooperation between the two sides. Russia
should not be excluded from Europe's or the world's affairs, and
should play a role as a major power, he added.

<P>
BUCHAREST, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The problem of an ageing
population in Romania is worsening, with an increase in the number
of people over 60, the national statistics bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Over 60s now account for 17.7 percent of the total population,
up from 16.8 percent at the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to the national statistics bureau, the death rate in
the first nine months last year was 12.7 per thousand people, the
highest rate for the last past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The high death rate, as well as rising emigration, has led to a
fall in the population from 23.2 million five years ago to 22.6
million as of July 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Research to Probe Ocean Depth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China will launch exploratory
investigations in the "Chinese Pioneer Area" of the Pacific Ocean
next year, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The research, to be conducted by the China Ocean Mineral
Resources Research and Development Association (COMRA), is aimed
at assessing the environmental impact of ocean exploration and
preventing unfavorable developments in marine ecology caused by
deep sea mining.
</P>
<P>
COMRA was registered in 1991 with the United Nations as an
investor for deep-sea mining, and was allocated the Chinese
Pioneer Area, a 150,000-square-kilometer area of seabed in the
eastern Pacific Ocean basin.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 it has undertaken several exploratory voyages
into the area, during which time a considerable amount of data was
collected with hi-tech instruments.
</P>
<P>
The area is rich in polymetallic nodules containing large
quantities of high-grade copper, nickel, cobalt and manganese,
according to Jin Jiancai, secretary-general of COMRA.
</P>
<P>
Besides carrying out investigations on natural resources,
COMRA has also been gathering data on the deep-sea area's chemical,
geologic and biological conditions, Jin said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Low inflation is the bright side of Australia's economic
performance, confirmed again by yesterday's figures. The dark side
is an unemployment rate stuck at about 8.5 percent and, on the
government's latest economic forecasts, unlikely to improve much
by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's inflation rate has hit its lowest level since
the recession, paving the way for another interest rate cut to
combat persistently high unemployment. Official figures released
yesterday showed inflation rose just 0.2 percent in the December
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Children could be turned away from schools unless they were
immunized against childhood diseases, under a contentious proposal
raised yesterday by the federal Education Minister David Kemp.
Australia has one of the lowest rates of child immunization in the
world, as only 53 percent of children are immunized.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Expenditure on legal gambling in Victoria rose by 19 percent
to about 2.54 billion Australian dollars (2.032 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1995-96, a government survey found that expenditure on
electronic gaming machines led the way, with a rise of almost 31
percent in the year.

<HEADLINE> FIFA May Sanction Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A new threat is hanging over
Costa Rican soccer that could be sanctioned by the International
Football Association (FIFA) due to a legal intervention in the
local federation.
</P>
<P>
An investigative judge ordered a search Tuesday of the
headquarters of the Costa Rican Soccer Federation to gather all
the records that led to the removal of Brazilian Valdeir Vieira as
coach of the national team.
</P>
<P>
Vieira had sued his former team, the Alajuele soccer club,
current national champion, over vacation pay and his year-end
bonus which it still owes him.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the clubs demanded Vieira withdraw his claim
if he wanted to continue to be the coach of the team. But He
refused to do so and was fired by the Federation a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Legal authorities decided to take action to investigate whether
or not the soccer Federation had, in fact, violated any law with
its demand that someone renounce his rights which is considered
coercion.
</P>
<P>
The judge who is in charge of the case issued a search warrant
Tuesday of the Federation offices from which several boxes of
papers were removed.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Vice-President for the Northern, Central American and
Caribbean area Isaac Sasso, a Costa Rican, announced Wednesday
that he will inform the FIFA of what has happened.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA prohibits any country from interfering in soccer
matters and suspends national federations when any intervention
occurrs.

MANAGUA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are the
news highlights in Central America today:
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Military powers should be subordinate to civilian
powers, represented by the president, who personifies the will of
the people, Nicaragua's army chief General Joaquin Cuadra told a
local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past decade the topic of the
subordination of military powers to civilian ones has been very
controversial.
</P>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA -- The Spanish government notified its Honduran
counterpart today of its willingness to donate 400,000
U.S. dollars to back the transfer of the Honduran Police from a
military force to a civilian one.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gomez Mujica, Spain's ambassador to Honduras, said
that apart from this monetary donation, his government will
also provide assistance for training police officers and agents
as it has done with other countries in the region, Guatemala and El
Salvador.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- A plague known as "rooster eyes" is devastating
entire coffee crops in Costa Rica, which could trigger a severe
drop in coffee bean yields in the country, the Federation of
Coffee Crops warned today.
</P>
<P>
"Rooster eye", a fungus that destroys coffee crops with
alarming speed, was detected in southern Costa Rican hamlets where
25 percent of the best coffee beans in the country are grown.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The African All-Star squad
downed its European counterpart 2-1 in a friendly game hailed as a
starting point for the "European Year Against Racism."
</P>
<P>
African captain Abedi Pele of Ghana, who plays the German club
1860 Munich, and Sporting Lisbon's Moroccan striker Mustafa Hadji
scored in each half to clinch victory for the Africans.
</P>
<P>
Paris St. Germain's Vincent Guerin netted Europe's sole goal
seconds before the halftime.
</P>
<P>
Pele chipped the ball delicately over Ajax keeper Edwin van der
Sar to put Africa ahead 15 minutes into play.
</P>
<P>
Benfica's Joao Pinto slid in at the back post to tap the ball
just wide as the interval approached, then Frenchman Guerin sliced
through the African defense to meet a Klinsmann pass and hit a low
drive in for the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
Hadji got the winning goal when he led the African team's
all-out counter-attack in the 77th minute.
</P>
<P>
In order to clean up European soccer's image, which has been
tainted by a series of racist incidents on and off the pitch,
European soccer's governing body UEFA teamed up with the
Confederation of African Football to organize the event as part of
the European community's campaign against racism.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dollar's Fall Welcomed by NZ Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The sharp fall in the value
of the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar in the past few
days have received welcome from the country's exporters, who have
been struggling against the adverse effect of the high dollar.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar sank to its lowest level in five and half months
against the greenback yesterday, trading under 69 U.S. cents
compared with 71 U.S. cents earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Many exporters had blamed the high exchange rates of the NZ
dollar for their poor performance in recent years and the
depreciation of the dollar came as a relief to many exporters and
brought them some hope of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Federation spokesman Gilvert Peterson said the
fall from about 71 U.S. cents earlier this month to 68.8 U.S.
cents yesterday would make a big difference to the confidence of
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Fishing Industry Board chief executive Ray Dobson said fishing
companies were rejoicing at the lower dollar but not yet "dancing
in the streets."
</P>
<P>
"Most people are reserving judgment, but the relief is
welcome," Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
Most fish is sold in U.S. dollars, but a lot is also sold in
the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"The industry has been struggling to reduce costs and remain
competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Federated Farmers president Malcolm Bailey said the fall was
pleasing but the dollar was still overvalued by about 10 percent
and a correction was still justified. However, he expressed doubt
that the dollar would drop that much.
</P>
<P>
"With our income it is pretty much immediate. We suffer when
the dollar goes up, potentially there is a benefit very quickly
when the dollar goes down," Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
However, the NZ dollar still remains strong against the
Japanese yen and the German mark. A bank economist said the
dollar's fall in recent days reflected moves in the American and
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fall is partly attributed to the narrowing differential
between short-term interest rates in New Zealand and those in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, financial analysts believe, the Kiwi dollar is
starting to lose some of its appeal to investors, who had been
buying the dollar to take advantage of the high interest rates in
the country.

Guangdong Province totaled 610 billion yuan (about 73 billion US
dollars) in 1996, up more than 11 percent over 1995, a top
official of the province said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen an all-round economic growth, with the
industry turning out 1,000 billion yuan (about 120 billion US
dollars) worth-of goods and the export volume reaching 59 billion
US dollars, said Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at a reception to mark
the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector also enjoyed steady growth in 1996, in
spite of serious natural disasters, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central
Committee, said that people's living standard improved, as the
rise of commodity prices was controlled to below 4.5 percent, two
percent lower than the country's average level.
</P>
<P>
The number of people living in absolute poverty has been
reduced to 600,000 from more than 800,000.
</P>
<P>
The province's public security, education and legislation have
also improved, and the government has become cleaner, Xie
concluded.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the local people from all walks of life and the
overseas Chinese for their contributions to the province's
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Xie noted that the province will continue to focus on the
economic growth and ethical, cultural and social progress in 1997,
a year full of significant events.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese Communist Party will
open its 15th National Congress, he said.

<HEADLINE> Qaidam Basin to Play Key Role in Oil Bonanza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The race for oil and gas
exploration in northwest China's Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province
is to be stepped up this year.
</P>
<P>
The basin is set to play an even more important role in China's
oil development strategies.
</P>
<P>
During 1996 the basin produced 1.4 million tons of crude oil
and 120 million cu m of gas, and added 40 million tons of verified
oil reserves and five billion cu m of gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas resources were further exploited in the basin with
the completion of two oil pipelines of a total length of 292 km
and the installation of a gas-powdered generating unit. The basin
produced 130 million cubic meters of natural gas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern Chinese province also plans to produce 1.5
million tons of crude oil and 200 million cu m of gas this year.
</P>
<P>
The province will also speed up the on-going second-phase
construction of the Golmud Oil Refinery, which will cost 230 million
yuan of investment, to achieve better economic benefits. The
project is expected to be finished in September.
</P>
<P>
Workers have already verified 208 million tons of geological
oil reserves and 59.3 billion cu m of geological natural gas
reserves in Qaidam Basin's 22 oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Provincial Petroleum Administration shows
that the province and EXXON company of the United States have
spent 3.95 million U.S. dollars in oil prospecting across 11,600
sq km of the basin since they started their cooperation in late
1995.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation, Qinghai Provincial
Government and Amoco Company of the United States, have agreed to
jointly invest in the construction of large chemical projects for
producing polyvinyl chloride, caustic soda, synthetic ammonia,
urea in Golmud, located in the middle of the Qaidam Basin, during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the Qaidam Basin, covering an area of
240,000 sq km, and rich in oil and gas resources, will play an
important role in China's oil industrial strategy of stabilizing
oil production in the eastern areas of China and vigorously
developing oil reserves in the western areas.

<HEADLINE> Rich States Urged to Be Responsible for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today the developed countries should fulfil their
responsibilities in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Xia Kunbao, the Deputy Head of the Chinese delegation, said at
the ongoing 19th Session of the Governing Council of the U.N.
Environmental Program (UNEP) the present global environmental
problems are mainly caused by the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries should bear greater responsibilities,
Xia stressed, adding that the principle of "common but
differentiated responsibilities" was agreed upon at the Earth
Summit held in Brazil five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a report which says China threw weight behind
the developing world's clamor for more aid, he said that "we are
not asking for aid. We are asking the developed countries to
fulfil their responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNEP administration and governing structure
needs adequate financial and human resources to implement its
programs, although it should undergo profound reforms in its
programs.
</P>
<P>
"We agree money alone cannot save UNEP. Money alone cannot
solve all the problems. But we also believe that without
adequate money UNEP cannot effectively and efficiently perform
its functions," Xia told the two-week meeting which opened here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNEP is facing a financial crisis which it has never faced
mainly due to the reduction of contributions to UNEP by some
developed countries.

<HEADLINE> First Inflation-Protected Notes Sold in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government sold
today 7 billion dollars in securities that are designed to protect
investment against inflation for the first time in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year notes issued by the U.S. Treasury Department were
auctioned in minimum denominations of 1,000 dollars with an
interest coupon rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The notes' principal will be adjusted twice a year for
inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index of U.S Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
Interest will be paid semiannually based on the
inflation-adjusted value of the security at the time.
</P>
<P>
The principal of the new notes also is protected against
deflation, or a decline in face value. The government will pay at
maturity no less than the value when purchased.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had predicted that most participants in the initial
auction would be Wall Street traders and institutional investors
such as pension funds rather than individuals.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Department officials are expecting more
participation by middle-class investors interested in preserving
their investments while earning interest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Probe Monkey Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists are now
probing whether a 40-year-old contaminated polio vaccine would
lead to certain rare cancers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. press reported here today that millions of Americans were
exposed to a monkey virus called SV40 by taking a contaminated
polio vaccine in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
But scientists recently found genetic pieces of SV40 lurking
inside tumors removed from cancer victims, and injecting the virus
into laboratory animals gives them cancer.
</P>
<P>
That's far from proof that SV40 actually harmed a person.
</P>
<P>
And some question whether continuing to use monkey tissue to
make vaccines might let as-yet-unknown viruses sneak in.
</P>
<P>
Mass vaccination with the then-new polio vaccine began in 1955.
But in 1960, doctors discovered SV40 in monkeys and in the
vaccine. It caused cancer when injected into hamsters, so the
government ordered companies to manufacture virus-free versions.
</P>
<P>
By the time the new versions reached the market in 1963, as
many as 98 million people may have been exposed to SV40.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists couldn't find the virus in human tissue at all
and questioned whether their colleagues were fooled by laboratory
contamination.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that researchers now have preliminary evidence
that SV40 may do damage by tying up proteins vital to keeping
cells from turning cancerous.
</P>
<P>
Also, SV40 appears related to two human viruses that harmlessly
infect nearly all Americans but which cause rare cancers in people
with severely damaged immune systems, such as AIDS patients. That
suggests SV40 could similarly be a risk only to immune-suppressed
patients.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build Sondu-Miriu Hydropower Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
decided to build the Sondu-Miriu hydropower station to improve
its power supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project will be built in three phases lasting five years
and is estimated to cost more than 161 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here on Tuesday, the Japanese
government will provide a soft loan of 58.3 million Dollars to
finance the project.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi said that the loan had come at an opportune time when
the country was experiencing chronic power shortage.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower station with a capacity of 60 megawatts is
expected to meet the projected growth in national electricity
demand and facilitate irrigation of up to 15,610 hectares in the
Kano Plain.
</P>
<P>
In the Kenya National Power Development Plan, the project has
been identified as being among the most optimum sites for
hydropower construction in the country and is strongly
recommended for early implementation.
</P>
<P>
In the project, an 18-meter-high dam with a capacity of 110
million cubic meters will be constructed at the Sondu River.

NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The stock mutual funds are
flourishing in the United States with investors pouring money into
equity funds at a near-record pace this month.
</P>
<P>
According to a report filed by some country's largest mutual
fund companies on Tuesday, cash flows to equity funds were ahead
of last January's pace and this month's pace was close to that of
a year ago. In January 1996 the industry attracted a record 26.9
billion U.S. dollars. Mutual fund experts estimate that net
inflows to stock funds in January will total 27 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the outstanding returns offered by the stock
market over the last two years, mutual fund investors are showing
few signs of wariness in their pursuit of the returns, and fund
managers are more optimistic, keeping their cash cushions at the
lowest levels in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Even if this month's inflows do not set a record, mutual fund
investors have voiced a resounding voice of confidence in the
outlook for the stock market, which started the year with sharp
gains.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Says Air Ban on Libya Still in Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council said on Wednesday that a five-year air ban on Libya will
remain in force and drew attention of member states to their
obligations under the ban.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Security Council passed resolution 748, which
requires all countries to deny permission to any aircraft to take
off from, land in or overfly their territory if it is destined to
land in, or has taken off from, Libyan territory. The air ban was
designed to force Libya to surrender two suspects of the Lockerbie
bombing.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, which was issued as a response to
an Libya announcement that it would resume international flights
out of Libya, the council said it would consider any such flights
to be a violation of the terms of Resolution 748.
</P>
<P>
The council also noted reports that a Libyan-registered
aircraft, in apparent violation of resolution 748, flew from
Tripoli, Libya to Accra, Ghana, on 21, January 1997, where it
landed and later departed.
</P>
<P>
It asked member states to meet their obligation under
Resolution 748 in the event that Libyan-registered aircraft seek
to land in their territory.
</P>
<P>
A Council source said that China played a big a role in
watering down a draft presidential statement raised by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"China," he said, "was of the view that the Libya's claim can
not be treated as an isolated incident."
</P>
<P>
China believed it was necessary to have an overall review of
the Libyan sanction issue since it has gained almost nothing
after five year's implementation, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Six African foreign ministers
have agreed to make preparations for another African summit over
the crisis in eastern Zaire, Kenyan Foreign Minister S. Musyoka
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the Kenyatta International Airport from South
Africa, Musyoka told reporters that the ministers agreed at their
just-ended meeting in Pretoria to hold talks as soon as possible
with the leaders of that country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foreign ministers will also visit Burundi,
Rwanda and Uganda in a bid to seek a lasting solution to the
crisis in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, Musyoka, who chaired a two-day meeting of foreign
ministers of Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, the Congo,
and Cameroun in Pretoria, failed to give details on when and
where the summit will be held.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria meeting, focusing on the latest development in
Zaire, reaffirmed its "full support for the national sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Zaire", said Muyoka.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also praised the commitment of the Zairean
government to grant full citizenship rights to all the Tutsi
people in eastern Zaire and to hold general elections in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The ministers warned all countries and groups off military
involvement in the conflict in the Great Lakes region, saying it
would only lead to an escalation of bloodshed there.
</P>
<P>
Two African summits over the eastern Zaire crisis were held in
Nairobi last November and December and authorized the presidents
of Kenya, South Africa, Cameroun and Zimbabwe to take measures to
end conflicts and procure lasting peace in the region.
