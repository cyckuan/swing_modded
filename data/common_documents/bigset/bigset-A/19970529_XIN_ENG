<HEADLINE> Denial of Reproductive Rights Kills Millions of Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Denial of sexual and
reproductive rights -- including free choice with regard to
pregnancy and childbearing -- causes millions of deaths every
year, and much more illness and disability, the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the State of the World Population 1997, UNFPA said that gaps
and failures in reproductive health care, combined with widespread
discrimination and violence against women, amount to a massive
violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of denying sexual and reproductive rights are
as following:
</P>
<P>
-- 585,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes,
nearly all in developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- about 200,000 maternal deaths per year result from the lack
of or failure of contraceptive services;
</P>
<P>
-- 120-150 million women who want to limit or space their
pregnancies are still without the means to do so effectively;
</P>
<P>
-- at least 75 million out of the 175 million pregnancies each
year are unwanted, resulting in 45 million abortions;
</P>
<P>
-- 70,000 women die each year as a result of unsafe abortion
and an unknown number suffer infection and other health
consequences;
</P>
<P>
-- 3.1 million people were infected last year by the human
immune-deficiency virus (HIV) which leads to AIDS;
</P>
<P>
-- 1 million people die each year from reproductive tract
infections and there are more than 333 million new cases of
sexually transmitted diseases each year; and
</P>
<P>
-- 120 million women have undergone some form of female genital
mutilation; another 2 million are at risk each year.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA called for greater attention to human rights, especially
the promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment. This
requires legal reforms, better enforcement of existing laws, new
procedures to document violations, education about human rights
and alliances among institutions concerned with rights.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA also called for greater investment in primary health
care, particularly for sexual and reproductive health.

<HEADLINE> Canada, EU Close to Reach Drug Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the European Union (EU)
are close to reaching a trade agreement that would make drug
approvals easier in both jurisdictions, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, a pharmaceutical company
developing a drug to market could do all its tests in Canada or
the EU and have those recognized in the other jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
That would avoid duplicating paperwork and safety
certification, saying the drug companies substantial terms,
according to today's the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the EU has been working for the past three years on
the so-called "mutual recognition agreement", which also covers
safety and certification standards for medical devices,
telecommunications equipment and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially what it involves is a recognition of each other's
testing of standards," a spokesman for Canada's Foreign Affairs
and International Trade was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are only two issues keeping Canada and the EU
from reaching a deal, according to Roy Christianson, the EU
spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
One involves getting Canada's provinces to sign on, since some
certification procedures fall under their purview.
</P>
<P>
The other concerns a definition of rules of origin, since some
have Japanese or U.S. components.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian side hopes to wrap up a deal in the next month or
two, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on China's Energy Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng outlined China's
state energy policy in an article published in the latest issue of
Qiushi, or "Seeking Truth," a theoretical journal published by the
Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the six-part article, the premier expounds on key
development strategies for China's energy industry, the guidelines
for the development of China's coal, oil, electricity, nuclear
power industries, energy saving policy, and the relationship
between energy development and sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Li said China's energy industry has witnessed
laudable growth since the founding of the People's Republic in
1949. The country in 1996 produced equivalent to 1.26 billion tons
of standard coal of non-renewable energy, including raw coal,
crude oil, natural gas and hydro-electricity, ranking it among the
world's largest energy producers.
</P>
<P>
However, Li indicated that the per-capita energy consumption in
China is only 1.14 tons of standard coal, lower than the world's
average.
</P>
<P>
China is abundant in energy resources. However, the geographic
location of different resources is imbalanced and the use of
energy mix is in some ways irrational, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The country boasts rich coal resources and the world's top
hydro-power resources.
</P>
<P>
The proven deposits of oil and natural gas resources in China,
however, are insufficient for supporting the economic
growth. Thus, the country has had to strengthen the exploration of
domestic oil and natural resources, while importing a certain
amount of oil and gas from foreign countries to meet the shortage,
Li noted.
</P>
<P>
China now has an installed electricity generation capacity of
230 million kw, ranking second in the world, which has eased the
power shortage in most areas.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, he said, it is one of the prerequisites in
maintaining China's long-term and sustained economic development
whether the country's energy industry can meet the requirements of
the national economy. "Although there are still twists and turns
in the road ahead, we are confident in the prospects of China's
energy development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on China's Energy Policy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peng pointed out China's coal industry should place equal
emphasis on the construction of both the large state mines and the
smaller local ones.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China produced 1.38 billion tons of raw coal, making
the country a leading coal producer worldwide. Some 70 percent of
energy sources in China is from coal, and "such consumption mix
will unlikely be changed in a relatively long period of time,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Large- and medium-sized state-owned coal mines are still the
driving force of China's coal production. The key state mines last
year produced 530 million tons of coal, or 39 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Peng acknowledged the state mines have operated in
the red in recent years with the combined losses in 1992 hitting
5.77 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To help coal enterprises get out of their dismal situation, the
state has offered a series of preferential policies, such as
providing state allowances, returning the value-added taxes and
increasing financial aid for technical renovation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by the government and the coal
enterprises, the loss in 1996 was reduced to 400 million yuan and
the whole industry is expected to report net profits this year.
</P>
<P>
Small mines run by local governments, institutions or private
individuals played an ever important role in China's coal
production. The combined coal output produced by mines at the
township level reached 610 million tons last year, claiming 47
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises are required to abide by the relevant state
laws and regulations, improve their technical level and develop a
relatively larger economic scale to ensure sound development in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
Li estimated that China's coal industry is to grow at 2.3
percent annually in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000). The coal output in 2000 is expected to reach 1.45
billion tons, of which 50 million tons are for export.

<P>
In 1996, the combined output for the oilfields in the east,
such as Daqing, Shengli, and Liaohe, reached more than 120 million
tons, that of the oilfields in the west, 20 million tons, and that
from offshore, more than 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Daqing oilfield, the country's largest, is expected to maintain
its annual output of 50 million tons in the coming 15 years, based
on its ability to adopt new technology and find new deposits, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Rich oil and gas resources have been found in the western part
of China, and the future looks bright for the development of the
Tarim and Junggar basins, the Turpan depression in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, and the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
These areas have stipulated some measures to boost oil
production, and it is hoped there will be an increase of output
there in the future, Li said in the article.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has become an oil-importing country, and
the amount of imports is estimated to rise in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Speaking of natural gas, a high-efficiency, clean fuel and a
high-quality raw chemical material, he said the country's
production scale is fairly small, far below the world
average. Statistics show that China's natural gas output stood at
20.1 billion cubic meters last year.
</P>
<P>
The proven natural gas deposits in China amount to 1.3 trillion
cubic meters. Chongqing, Xijiang and the areas where Shaanxi,
Gansu, and Ningxia meet have become the three new gas-abundant
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the article, the premier also encouraged Chinese oil
companies to work with their overseas counterparts to explore and
develop international oil and gas resources, and undertake the
contracts of foreign projects and labor service to ensure the
long-term and stable supply of oil and gas in China.

<P>
China's power industry should continue to maintain a certain
growth rate in the coming 15 years to cater to the demand of the
national economy, social development, and people's daily living
needs.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the increase of electricity to that of the gross
domestic product (GDP) can be lowered a bit, in view of the
transfer of the economic growth mode, Li said, adding that the
figure is estimated at roughly 0.8.
</P>
<P>
Coal-fueled electric power will still account for 75 percent of
the total in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). However,
electricity of this kind will cause environmental pollution, and
large quantities of coal will need to be transported, so it should
not be boosted in large and medium-sized cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Electricity created from water, a clean and easily produced
energy source, should account for about 30 percent of the total in
China, the premier urged.
</P>
<P>
The development of electricity requires extensive funding, the
sources of which can be the State, local governments, enterprises,
and banks, as well as overseas funds in various forms, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As for the use of foreign capital, Li said that it should be
used to purchase domestic electricity-generating equipment, and
the quality and sales service of domestic equipment should be
improved in order to increase their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Li said, a rational system to collect
electricity fees should be established. Fees should vary, as
electricity is used in a wide variety of industries, and the
distance of electricity transport differs from place to place.
</P>
<P>
China has founded the State Power Corporation to separate its
functions from the government administration, Li said. The
corporation should shoulder the task of building a national power
network.
</P>
<P>
Small hydroelectric power stations should be extended in rural
areas, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's electricity output rose at an
annual rate of 8.3 percent from 1979 to 1996. The country's
power-generating capacity increased by more than 15 million
kilowatts annually in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).

<P>
Noting that Nuclear power is a safe and reliable energy, the
premier said that China has chosen pressurized water reactors for
its nuclear power plants, but their construction got off to a late
start.
</P>
<P>
There are currently a total of three power generating units,
with an overall installed capacity of 2.1 million kw, only one
percent of the country's total power generating capacity, in
Qinshan Nuclear Power Station, east China's Zhejiang Province, and
Daya Bay Nuclear Station in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Four nuclear power projects, with eight generating units and a
total installed capacity of 6.6 million kw, are expected to be
completed during the 2001-2005 period, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
By then, generated power of the plants will amount to about two
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
From a long-term perspective, Li said, the development of
nuclear power has a broad prospect in China, which has a group of
experienced researchers and technicians in the field.
</P>
<P>
They have been able to design and build nuclear power plants
with 300,000 kw pressurized water reactors, and are trying to
build a plant with double generating capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power industry should be developed steadily through
using overseas funds to buy advanced foreign equipment and
technology and expanding the double-generating power station with
its own profits, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to boost the industry include leaving more space
around the newly-built plant and expanding it in several phases,
giving priority to the safety of the plant, and improving the
industry's ability for self-development by following the trends of
international technology for nuclear power development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Other resources for power generation, including wind power,
solar energy, tidal energy and geothermal power, are still in the
experimental stage and should be used in accordance with specific,
local conditions, according to the premier.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is an important principle of China's energy policy that
equal attention be paid to both the development and saving of
energy, with saving efforts placed in the priority, Li said.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the country's energy-saving efforts
have progressed remarkably, with a total of 470 million tons of
standard coal saved.
</P>
<P>
But the utilization rate of energy in China is only about 32
percent, more than ten percent lower than the world advanced
level. The output value produced by a ton of standard coal in
China is only half to one-fourth of that in advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
This shows great potential for energy saving in China,
especially in industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The thermal power generation industry consumes most of China's
coal. To reduce coal consumption, China should encourage the use
of large coal-efficient generating units, rather than small ones,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has reduced the a combined consumption of
petroleum by 200 million tons by replacing petroleum with coal.
</P>
<P>
This has saved the precious resources of petroleum and also
reduced the cost of the fuel for enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of old-fashioned cooking stoves in rural areas and
the introduction of improved coal for home use have also helped to
save energy for the people's daily use.
</P>
<P>
The development and consumption of energy, which may cause
environmental pollution and ecological damage, should follow the
the strategy laid out for sustainable development, according to
him.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China should adopt proven techniques of pollution
control, such as using non-lead gasoline, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the renewable energy resources, including
water power, wind power and solar energy should be accelerated,
while the non-renewable mineral resources should be saved to as
great an extent as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We should not only take into account energy utilization for
this generation, but create favorable conditions for future
generations to allow for sustainable utilization of energy,"
Premier Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister Defends Netanyahu-Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy insisted today the Tuesday summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
was not a failure.
</P>
<P>
Replying to an urgent motion presented to the Knesset
(Parliament) by the opposition Labor lawmaker Moshe Shahal, Levy
said the summit held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, would help move
forward the peace process because it had boosted the government's
desire to pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
Shahal, former Public Security Minister, said the summit was
nothing more than a media event. He said Netanyahu had in fact
nothing to offer to the other side because of the pressure from
his hardline coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
He warned about the renewal of Intifada (Arab uprising) by the
Palestinians and a war with Syria if Netanyahu government
continued its hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who also attended the Netanyahu-Mubarak summit, expressed
the belief that the meeting would improve not only the
Israeli-Palestinian relations, but also the Israeli-Egyptian ties.
</P>
<P>
But he justified Israel's building of settlements, saying
nothing in the Oslo accords prevented such activities.
</P>
<P>
Levy urged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to move forward
to the final-status talks. He noted that while the peace
process had not collapsed, it demanded greater efforts from
both Israelis and Palestinians to achieve progress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rightist lawmakers from the coalition voiced their
concern about the possibility of secret dealings between
Netanyahu and Mubarak. Some pointed to the positive atmosphere
after the summit despite lack of apparent results as an
indication that Netanyahu might have clinched a secret deal with
Mubarak, perhaps on the Har Homa settlement project in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Michael Cleiner, lawmaker from Likud, said he did not believe
that there was any secret deal reached at the summit. But he
warned that if Netanyahu intended to halt the Har Homa
construction, then the rightist camp would throw him out of office.
</P>
<P>
Cleiner is head of the pro-settlement rightist group Land of
Israel Front which comprises of 18 lawmakers. If they rebelled
against Netanyahu, he would be forced to step down as the
coalition, which owns now 66 seats, will lose the 61-seat majority
in the 120-seat Knesset.

<HEADLINE> British Government Launches Defense Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson announced here today that the Labor government would
stage a wide-ranging strategic review of Britain's defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing today on the six-month review,
Robertson stressed that the review was not designed to cut costs,
but to produce a clear and coherent defense policy by saying "We
will maintain strong conventional forces and our national nuclear
deterrent."
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed dramatically in less than ten years.
Since the end of the Cold War, the security risks to the United
Kingdom, and to our Allies, have changed fundamentally. We no
longer face a threat of general war in Europe," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
"But new security challenges confront us, including the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, aggressive
nationalism, and international terrorism. We must ensure that
Britain is ready to face those challenges," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the aim of the review is to "build on the
developing consensus on defense and to establish the widest
possible shared vision about Britain's future security needs and
the tasks of its armed forces."
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary made it clear that "the government will
not take ad hoc or short-term approaches. We can not shape the
future simply by responding to the present. The review will give
the Armed Forces a coherent and stable planning basis for the year
2000 and beyond."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense is expected to stage two seminars and
set up a panel of experts to review Britain's defense role and
consult the opposition parties on various issues concerned.

<HEADLINE> Plane Bearing "Macedonia" Ordered to Leave Athens Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Civil Aviation Authority
today ordered an aircraft bearing the name "Macedonia" to leave
the Athens International Airport following its crew refused to
erase the word.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, leased by the Yugoslav airline company JAT,
arrived at the airport this morning from Skopje, capital of the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were allowed to disembark but the Greek side
refused to provide any services to the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Macedonia have been strained
since the latter declared its independence in 1991, with Athens
objecting to its neighbor's use of the term of "Macedonia" in any
form and saying that this implied claims to the northern Greek
province of the same name.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are currently engaged in United
Nations-sponsored talks to resolve the name issue, and
negotiations are reportedly in progress.

<HEADLINE> US Durable Goods Orders Increases in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods rose by 1.4 percent in April, bouncing back from a
decline in March, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that factory orders of the durable goods
totaled a seasonally adjusted 175.6 billion dollars, up from 173.2
billion in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 2.2 percent decline in March was slightly
revised down from the previous 2.6 percent estimate.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last more than
three years -- are a key gauge of the nation's manufacturing
strength.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that orders for all major categories except
electronic and other electrical equipment increased.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders reversed a three-month decline and posted
a 4.5 percent gain. Excluding transportation, orders were up 0.5
percent after sliding 1.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Orders for military equipment shot up 28 percent, wiping out
declines of 12.2 percent in March. And orders for nonmilitary
capital goods excluding aircraft fell 0.6 percent, the second
consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
But orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which
had been strong recently, plunged by 5.3 percent after a 7 percent
drop a month earlier. As in March, the loss was attributed to
electronic components and communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders, whose advances had suggested
growing demand earlier this year, fell by 0.4 percent for a second
straight month. A shrinking backlog suggests businesses are able
to keep up with demand without additional production facilities.
Shipments rose by 1.1 percent, the fourth straight advance.

<HEADLINE> Salim Confident of Re-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said here today he was
optimistic to win another term as head of the continental
organisation.
</P>
<P>
Salim, a Tanzanian seeking support for an unprecedented third
term in office, will fight it out with Cote d'Voire Foreign
Affairs Minister Amara Essy.
</P>
<P>
''I am optimistic but elections are election and nobody knows
what's going to be the outcome,'' he told the Zimbabwean News
Agecy.
</P>
<P>
''But when you are contesting you don't do so without an
optimism,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim said he had done ''a lot of consultations since
elections of the OAU secretary-general involves the heads of
state''.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief declared himself happy and proud with the
achievements of the organisation during the past two decades he had
worked for it.
</P>
<P>
''I have been very priviledged to see the end of
decononisation in Africa, the end of apartheid and to be part of
the efforts to constitute a new agenda of the OAU,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other achievements, he cited the establishment of the
OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
and the signing by member states of the Abuja treaty in 1991 to
set up the African economic community.
</P>
<P>
''In the last 20 years I feel very proud of making the
organisation more relevant to the needs of today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the challenges facing OAU now were the need to
improve the standard of living of the people in Africa, and to
achieve that there was need for the continent to be politically
stable.
</P>
<P>
Salim said topping the agenda of the OAU heads of state and
government summit from June 2 to 4 will be economic and political
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said since the focus is now on economic integration this year's
OAU summit will be transformed into an African economic summit.
</P>
<P>
Political situations in the new Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Liberia
and Sierra Leone which suffered a coup recently would also dominate
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He described the financial situation of the organisation as sound,
saying this was testimony of the seriousness in which member states
were taking the organisation.
</P>
<P>
He said by the first week of May more than 50 percent of regular
budget of this year had been paid by member states.
</P>
<P>
He praised the ambassadors who were meeting in Harare for the past
three days to prepare the agenda for the Council of Ministers meeting
starting today, saying they had done ''very good work''. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Going All Out to Helping Jobless Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo emphasized
at a national conference here today the importance of coming to
the aid of the country's unemployed workers and finding them new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The thorny issue, which must be resolved if national
development is to be accelerated, is the legacy of the former
long-term planned economy, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should be put into helping China's state-owned and
collective businesses restructure their set-up and create new job
opportunities for their surplus labor force, in a bid to help
enhance their competitiveness in the marketplace, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, China reported a record of more than nine
million displaced workers. In addition, nearly 11 million workers
had not been paid or were paid lower wages than usual, and
approximately 2.3 million retired workers had not received
pensions or were given reduced pensions.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the problem, Wu called on all forces nationwide to
raise money from different channels to guarantee the basic living
costs for the displaced workers, and give a big boost to the
reemployment project to resettle the jobless.
</P>
<P>
The country will take a big step forward this year, Wu added,
in reforming state-owned enterprises and in promoting mergers for
bankrupt enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in order to develop the re-employment scheme,
China will focus on educating people about job-seeking, increasing
new jobs, training surplus workers with new techniques, and
improving its labor force market, Wu said.

Association quoting statistics from the United Nations Population
Fund report "state of world population 1997".
</P>
<P>
The report said China was at the top of the population list

Russia 147.7 million, Pakistan 143.8 million, Japan 125.6 million and
Bangladesh 122 million.
</P>
<P>

annual growth rate between 1995 and 2000, higher than the 0.3
percent of advanced nations but lower than the world average of
1.4 percent and 1.7 percent of developing countries.
</P>

CHANGCHUN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Roots of a tree in northeast
China's Jilin Province have been carved to shape the words "Hong
Kong Returns" as a gesture to welcome Hong Kong's return to the

</P>
<P>
The tree-root carving was done by Sun Tingkai, a veteran
craftsman from the city of Baishan. He plans to donate the carving
to a celebration event for the Hong Kong handover.
</P>
<P>
The idea came to Sun four years ago when he noticed found a
zigzagged tree root which looked like the Chinese character
"Xiang," which in Chinese is the first character in "Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Sun then decided to create his own root carving specially
designed for the historic event on July 1.

<HEADLINE> EU Reconfirms Accession Talks With Cyprus on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's accession
talks with Cyprus will begin as originally scheduled for early
next year, a top EU official said today.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for External Affairs and EU Enlargement Hans
Van den Broek reaffirmed this in a meeting in Brussels with
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, during which they
discussed the island's course to EU accession and the Cyprus
problem, according to Cyprus News Agency (CNA).
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU
will begin early 1998, six months after the end of the
Intergovernmental Conference, as stipulated by an EU Council
decision of March 1995.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Cyprus problem, Van den Broek said the EU
firmly supports current U.N. initiatives, aiming at bringing
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot community
leader Rauf Denktash at the negotiating table for face-to-face
talks by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to issue
invitations to Clerides and Denktash for direct talks on a
solution to the protracted Cyprus problem, taking place in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek expressed hope that important steps will be made
this year toward a solution, a move which will also facilitate
Cyprus' bid to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister briefed the commissioner on the
latest developments in Cyprus and the Cypriot government's views
for a solution to the problem, CNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in July 1990. The Cyprus
problem has remained unsolved despite the international
community's peace efforts for the past 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island became divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
control of the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hopes for New Relations with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy today expressed his country's hope for a new relationship
with Iran, following last week's Iranian presidential election,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Knesset (Israel's parliament), Levy said that
the election of Mohammed Khatami as the next president might
herald a new era in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, regarded as a moderate cleric with wide support among
younger Iranians, took 20.7 million votes of the 29.7 million
cast in last Friday's election and was declared the next Iranian
president.
</P>
<P>
Israeli analysts earlier pointed out that the election of
Khatami might result in domestic reforms in Iran, but would not
change Iran's policy toward Israel and the West.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli foreign minister said today although
foreign policy was not the main issue in the Iranian
election, he hoped that Khatami would adopt a liberal policy.
</P>
<P>
Levy declared that Israel has never defined Iran as an enemy,
adding it was Iran that talked about destroying the Jewish state
and supported Hezbollah in South Lebanon against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy also called on the new Iranian leader to cooperate in
securing the release of Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who was
shot down and captured in Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Member of the Knesset Haggai Merom
today also appealed for a new approach from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Merom said that the hope, showed by the Iranian people in last
week's election, for freedom and peace was the basis for a new
relationship between Israel and Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, both Levy and Merom admitted that it was still too
early to say -- and that they had to wait and see -- if there
would be a change of Iranian policy toward Israel.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Britain Keen to Play Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior British official said here
today that Britain is anxious to play a role in the Middle East
region and Jordan can help it break the barriers in realizing the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Derek John Fatchett, British minister of state for foreign
affairs, made the remarks at a press conference after he held
talks with King Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Britain is keen to fully engage in the peace process and
contribute to it, said Fatchett before leaving here for Syria on a
Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
Britain has a long history of standing in the region and is now
here as "a candid friend and supporter of the peace process to
offer our service and our advice," said the minister of state of
Britain, which colonized Jordan after the First World War and in
1946 admitted the independence of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
But Britain is not trying to "compete with others" and only
thinks that British presence here can contribute to the people in
the region who deserve more stability and high standard of living,
added Fatchett, who conducts the first ever visit of a British
cabinet minister here.
</P>
<P>
The only way to realize Britain's goal is through a
comprehensive Middle East peace deal which provides justice and
security and build the foundation for future cooperation and
long-term relationship among the countries, Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Britain has some barriers and obstacles
in materializing the goal and he now comes to Jordan to seek
its help.
</P>
<P>
In return, he said, Britain has been contributing to helping
Jordan overcome its current economic hardship, such as
rescheduling its debts and speeding up the privatization of its
telecommunication system.
</P>
<P>
Britain also used its influence to help increase the U.S. aid
to Jordan, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are also European Union and Britain's aid coming to Jordan
too, the minister of state added.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's military incursion in northern Iraq to attack the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, Fatchett said that dialogue
and political compromise might be the long-term solution.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been playing an active role in the Mideast peace
process and mediated in last January the Hebron accord between
Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> IPE Upgrades Natural Gas Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum Exchange
has implemented a number of modifications to the electronic Energy
Trading System (ETS) used to trade natural gas futures.
</P>
<P>
The changes have been made after wide consultation with the
industry and they will improve the quality of the service
available to ETS users, International Petroleum Exchange (IPE)
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Claire Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, is investigating a key
element of gas pricing after a review showed that prices have been
too volatile and have not always reflected supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
She said: "There have been opportunities for people to make
money playing the market and that wasn't the idea. The intention
was simply that demand would be balanced by supply."
</P>
<P>
New warning messages have been incorporated into the software.
When a bid is more than 0.5p/therm above the last traded price,
the warning "limit price is significantly above last trade" will
be given.
</P>
<P>
And when an offer is more than 0.5p/therm below the last trade
price, the warning "limit price is significantly below last trade"
will be given.
</P>
<P>
When a traded price is not available for that day the previous
day's settlement price will be used as the reference.
</P>
<P>
Traders will no longer be able to enter a bid higher than the
best offer, or enter an offer below the best bid. This will bring
the ETS in line with current practices on the trading floor where
breaking the market is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
Traders will still be able to utilize the "facility from the
depth of market screen when they wish to take out more than one
bid or offer at a time.

<HEADLINE> Big Tax Increases in Budget Unlikely, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the
exchequer, need not raise taxes in his mini-budget, according to a
report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Goldman
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
Gavyn Davies, the chief international economist at Goldman
Sachs, said that the best way to tackle booming consumer demand
was through higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said a 1 percent increase in interest rates had the same
impact as increasing consumer taxes by about 9 billion pounds
(14.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Green Budget" estimates that rates will
rise to between 7.25 percent and 7.50 percent over the coming year
from the current level of 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
If current spending plans are achieved and the economy
continues to grow in line with the present trend, Green Budget
forecasts the elimination of the public sector borrowing
requirement within three years.
</P>
<P>
It predicts a drop in the public sector borrowing requirement
to a better than expected 14.3 billion pounds (22.88 billion US
dollars) in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
This could fall as low as 12.3 billion pounds (19.68 billion US
dollars) in the same year if the Government's windfall tax is
implemented, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The report says the proposed windfall tax is unlikely to
increase consumer bills significantly, or decrease investment by
utility companies.
</P>
<P>
It also gives the proposed drop in the starting rate of income
tax to 10 percent a lukewarm reaction.

<HEADLINE> Muzenda Urges OAU Find Solutions to Conflicts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon Muzenda
today implored the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to try to find
solutions to the continent's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda, who was officially opening the 66th Session of the
Ministers of OAU in Harare, blamed some of the conflictgs on lack of
justice and fairness on the part of the governments.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the resurgence of conflicts continues to be a cause of
concern to us. What is most worrying is that most of these conflicts
are intra-state, with only a few inter-state disputes.''
</P>
<P>
''Intra-state conflicts are not easy to solve, as they are usually
deep-rooted. Nonetheless, solutions have to be found,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In that regard, he commended the establishment of the mechanism
for conflict prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
''I call upon all member states to rally behind the OAU and give
it the necessary assistance to strengthen the mechanism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He commended the OAU's active role in mediating in conflicts,
either on its own or in cooperation with the United Nations and
sub-regional organisations.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''I strongly believed that there is light at the end of
the tunnel, as witnessed by the progress towards the resolutions of
conflicts in Liberia, Angola and former Zaire.''
</P>
<P>
He hoped the remaining conflicts in Somalia, Burundi, Western
Sahara and Sierra Leone would also be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He praised the session for diverting from the usual focus on
political matters and devoting special attention to economic and
social issues.
</P>
<P>
He urged OAU member states to move with greater speed and
purposefulness in integrating their economies under the African
economic community. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The OAU Council of Ministers opened its
66th meeting here today to work out the agenda for the 33rd summit of
African countries scheduled for June 2-4.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from member states of the Organization of African
Unity were attending the three-day meeting which would underline the
determination of African countries to strive for political stability
and economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Zimbabwean Vice President S.
V. Muzenda said the meeting would be devoted to the deliberations on
political, economic, social and other issues that concern
individual countries, and the continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to remove themselves from the
predicaments they find themselves in, put forward concrete proposals
and take appropriate steps for durable solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said peace and stability remain the major concern of the
OAU as some African countries continue to be haunted by
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
African countries, he said, must "rally behind the OAU and give it
the necessary assistance" to strengthen its mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said special attention should also be given to economic and
social issues. "There is need for a collective effort... Member states
must move with greater speed and purposefulness in integrating our
economies under the African economic community".
</P>
<P>
Participants proceeded with their discussion behind closed doors
after the opening session. enditem

<HEADLINE> OAU Secretary General Stresses African Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- "We have learnt from experience that

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President: Tamil Rebellion to be Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
be able to solve the 12-year-old Tamil rebellion within the
framework of a political formula along with a new constitution by
the end of this year, visiting Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Bandaranaika Kumaratunga said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have a vast majority who support the political solution we
have presented to the country," Kumaratunga told reporters before
wrapping up her three-day official visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We think that by the end of the year we can find a solution
to the problem, with the objective of bringing in a new
constitution, with all the political solutions, the division of
power which we have proposed to all the regions and the various
communities which would satisfy the majority of the people," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that a solution is expected by the end of this year
and this is the first time a serious political solution has been
attempted.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Sri Lankan armed forces had taken
back "more than three fourth of the land area and about 80 percent
of Tamil people are now living in government controlled areas."
</P>
<P>
The rebellious Tamil Tigers have been fighting for an
independent state in Sri Lanka for about a decade. Recently the
government troops were reportedly hitting hard against the rebels
and successfully confining them within a jungle area.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga arrived here Monday and met with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah Tuesday to discuss bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
She also discussed with Kuwaiti officials the issues of double
taxation between the two countries and Sri Lankan laborers in
Kuwait. She extended an invitation to the Amir for visiting Sri
Lanka next year which the Amir accepted, official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investment Flows into Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments
(FDI) in Africa have slowed down and become quite modest in
Africa compared with other areas of the third world in early
1990s, according to the latest 1996 World Investment Directory on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The FDI in Africa hit 4.7 billion U.S. Dollars in 1995, down
from five billion in 1994 but sharply up from 2.8 billion
annually between 1986 and 1990 on the average and 1.7 billion
annually from 1981 to 1985, said the document.
</P>
<P>
Africa's annually FDI share in the developing region fell to
some 5.4 percent from 10.8 percent in the second half of 1980s
from 8.6 percent in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Africa's FDI share in the whole world dropped to
only 1.7 percent per year on the average during the first half of
1990s, down from 1.8 percent in 1986-1990 and 2.9 percent in
1981-1985.
</P>
<P>
The weak FDI flows into Africa reflect some basic economic
faces of the continent.
</P>
<P>
First, an almost total absence of portfolio equity investment
flows to Africa during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, continues to rely
heavily on grants and official loans, which constitute the bulk
of its net resource flows.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, FDI, the most important type of private capital,
accounts for only about 10 percent of sub-Saharan Africa's total
net resource flows.
</P>
<P>
Second, foreign money focuses on nine Africa oil-exporting
countries, which made up more than four-fifths of the foreign
investment in Africa during the first half of the 1980s and
two-thirds at the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Nigeria absorbed more than half of the total foreign
investment in Africa and three quarters in the African
oil-exporting countries between 1981 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Third, the weak FDI inflow in Africa is also due to the fact
that Africa has most least-developed countries in the world -- 33
of the total of 48 poorest countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In these poorest countries, investment inflows are discouraged
by various factors including small domestic markets, unskilled
labour force, poorly developed physical infrastructure and high
levels of external indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries such as Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and Gabon
experienced considerable declines in FDI flows during the
mid-1980s and early 1990s, leading to a situation where
divestment exceeded new investment flows.
</P>
<P>
In Equatorial Guinea, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and
Zimbabwe, however, a strong FDI performance in the early 1990s
may signal a change from wide-ranging annual fluctuations or low
levels of FDI inflows to a steady growth.
</P>
<P>
The highest achievers of increasing inflows are Morocco and
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The six northern African countries -- Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia -- altogether enjoy a higher share of
about two-fifths in Africa's total inflows due to the relatively
strong interest of western Europe in the Mediterranean area.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors show uneven interest in Africa. Due to
geographical proximity and post-colonial ties, western European
investors dominate FDI on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Among European countries, France and Britain are the principal
investors in Africa. They constitute more than four-fifths of the
western European stock in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the developed countries, FDI in Africa originates
from the following three main sources.
</P>
<P>
--Intra-regional. The main source of this investment is South
Africa, with outflows directed mainly to its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Second, Arab states, especially those in the Gulf. Northern
African countries are the largest recipients.
</P>
<P>
-- Third, south-eastern Asian countries. The main destination
is South Africa where Malaysia constituted about half the total
FDI inflows in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Asian investors have also shown an interest in South Africa's
neighboring countries, from where they can produce goods at low
cost and export them to South Africa.

<HEADLINE> GCC Plans to Invest 10 Billion Dollars in Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) plan to invest more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars in industrial projects over the next two years, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Projects worth some 18 billion dollars are being discussed, but
the amount of 10 billion dollars is more realistic, Gulf News
quoted a senior Gulf industrial official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investment is a further move by GCC states to diversify
their resources of national income, which is heavily reliant on
oil exporting, Abdul Rahman al Jaffery, secretary general of the
Qatar-based Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting said in an
exclusive interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that there is a growing awareness among the
GCC countries of the importance of diversifying their oil
economies by establishing more industries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Oman which have the control over nearly 45
percent of the world's proven oil reserves.

U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) since 1993, have
worked hard to fulfill their mission.
</P>
<P>
"I will be very happy to see all the problems in this country
solved by the time our soldiers go back to Argentina," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all U.N. resolutions on Cyprus will
be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president is expected to pay a courtesy call on
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The 380-strong Argentine force is the largest serving
contingent in UNFICYP. It monitors the western part of the
180-kilometer long buffer zone, separating the
government-controlled southern part of the island from the
Turkish-controlled northern areas.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island became divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
control of the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Industrial Product Prices Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's industrial product prices
rose 0.5 percent in April from their March level, Statistics
Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April 1996, industrial prices increased 1.6
percent, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, there would be almost no change in the price level for a
seventh consecutive month, excluding the effect of the rise in the
value of the U.S. dollar on export prices.
</P>
<P>
"The April increase in the value of U.S. dollar against the
Canadian dollar raised the value in Canadian dollars of all export
prices quoted in U.S. currency," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"This increased the month-to-month change in industrial prices
from zero to 0.5 percent," it added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the raw material price index went down 1.1
percent from that of March, mainly due to lower crude oil prices
and weaker prices for non-ferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
On a 12-month basis, Canadian manufacturers paid 2.6 percent
less for raw materials compared with April 1996.

<HEADLINE> Immediate Elections in Ex-Zaire Improper: Mkapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa said today it is improper and absurd to ask Laurent Kabila,
the leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo (ex-Zaire), to
call for elections before necessary bodies are set up there.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries recently called for immediate general
elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo after Kabila swept
into power on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Opening the sixth Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA)
speakers and presiding officers conference for Africa region here
today, Mkapa said that political reforms must not be seen as what
can only be measured by externally determined yardstick.
</P>
<P>
"To ask President Kabila to call for elections even before he
has reached Kinshasa or created the necessary institutions and
capacities to do so is not only an expression of arrogance in
ignorance, but completely absurd," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the elections are but one component of a complex
interplay and interaction of institutions, circumstances and
processes that constitute a healthy and thriving democracy.
</P>
<P>
"They must not in themselves and in isolation be hallowed as
the embodiment of democracy," he said, adding that the evolution
of democracy takes time.
</P>
<P>
He said internal changes, including economic and social
development, wealth generation, better health and education, were
very important foundations for genuine and sustainable democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Political development needs to go hand in hand with economic
development. It is difficult to have a working and genuine
democracy in a situation of abject poverty," noted Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
"In any case, democracy itself is expensive and needs a strong
economy to sustain it," he stressed.

to UNDP country offices or to sub-regional facilities over the next
three years;
</P>
<P>
-- UNDP will establish a system of sub-regional facilities in
the five program regions it serves;
</P>
<P>
-- Full authority is being delegated to UNDP country offices to
develop and approve programs within a country cooperation framework
authorized by the Executive Board;
</P>
<P>
-- UNDP managers worldwide will be able to act quickly but with
accountability because of new ex-post accountability measures;
</P>
<P>
-- UNDP headquarters is being restructured to support the
decentralization move and will concentrate on issues such as
planning, advocacy of program country development needs,
accountability and fund-raising;
</P>
<P>
-- Investment will be made in new staff skills as well as
management skills; and
</P>
<P>
-- Efficiency will be rewarded to ensure the organization produces
more value for money, and an Efficiency Ombudsman will be appointed.

CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has won approval from the Paris Club to help it
postpone repayment of its debt totalling 450 million U.S. dollars
due to be repaid between June 1, 1997 and September 7, 1999,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
This will give big impeduts to Jordan's economic adjustment
program due to end in February 1999, said Finance Minister
Suleiman Hafez.
</P>
<P>
Among the debts to be rescheduled, 400 million dollars belongs
to Paris Club members and the rest to non-members, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Hafez indicated that the rescheduling is in two parts: an
amount of debt on a bilateral government-to-government basis and
the second known as export credits which are guarantees given by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has delayed repaying debts for three times respectively
in 1989, 1992 and 1994. The last debt rescheduling agreement
covered the period up to May 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Now Jordan's debt stands at 6.5 billion dollars, accounting for
some 90 percent of its gross national product.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Israel will open a consulate in Jordan's Red Sea
resort of Aqaba, where the two governments are seeking to develop
joint tourism facilities, according to Jordan Times Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The consulate will deal with economic issues and provide
assistance to Israeli tourists traveling in Aqaba which is located
next to the Israeli resort of Eilat, the state-owned English daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the opening of the offices came amist
reports that Israel and Jordan had settled a water dispute that
had recently sent bilateral tensions soaring.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has agreed to begin negotiations with Israel on
the construction of two rail links between the two countries,
local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first line will allow Jordan to export Dead Sea chemicals
through Israel's Mediterranean port of Ashdod in addition to the
Red Sea port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The second rail line will be laid between Aqaba and Israel's
neghboring port of Eilat in an effort to improve tourism.
</P>
<P>
There are also proposals to build a rail line between the
sister ports and the Dead Sea area to increase the flow of freight
and another between Israel's Haifa port and the Jordanian city of
Mafraq.
</P>
<P>
Aqaba soon will become a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Official statistics has shown that Turkey's 1996
trade deficit hits 19.4 billion U.S. dollars, a 37.7 percent
increase compared with that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News said today that the figures, which
was released by the State Institute of Statistics on Tuesday, was
a bad news for the Turkish public.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, Turkey's imports for 1996 climbed to
42.464 billion dollars while its exports only stood at 23.082
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Turkey's agriculture exports increased by 16.9
percent, industrial exports by 5.7, but the mining exports fell
by 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 35.709 billion dollars of imports for 1995,
Turkey got a rapid growth in imports in 1996, with 53.4 percent
up of raw materials, 31 percent up of industrial equipment and 15.6
percent up of consumption goods.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here noted that the EU-Turkey Customs Union,
which came into effect on January 1, 1996, had greatly
contributed to the huge 1996 trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The waiting by many Turkish importers hoping for the lowering
or abolishment of certain tariffs in late 1995, which did not
took place as expected, led to a sharp increase in imports in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The European Union seems to be the biggest gainer from the
custom union, according to the economists, who said that Turkey's
imports from the EU in 1996 increased by 32.5 percent, but the
exports got a only 3.7 percent of growth.
</P>
<P>
The EU accounted for 52.6 percent of all Turkish imports and
49.8 percent of all the exports in 1996, according to the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the most important trading partner with Turkey, still
ranks first in trade with Turkey, with 7.464 billion dollars in
exports and 5.168 billion dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
Italy came second on the list of trading partners with Turkey,
followed by Russia, the United States and Britain.
</P>

YAOUNDE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government signed with
Cameroun an agreement here today to renew its support for a
six-year microbiological development project in the University of

Wei highly appraised the educational exchanges between the two
countries, saying the Chinese government attaches importance to
them and would like to foster a long term cooperation with
Cameroun as well as the whole African region.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein, British to Hold More Talks on N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) - Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), said today it would hold more talks
with British officials aimed at rebuilding Northern Ireland's
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed Sinn Fein's right to be treated on the same
basis as all the other parties and we have agreed to meet again,"
senior negotiator Caoimhghin O Caolain told reporters after the
second round talks in the Ulster capital of Belfast today.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein representative said there had been in-depth
discussions about vexed issues that his delegation had raised last
week when Britain ended a 16-month freeze on meetings between
civil servants and Sinn Fein leaders.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein wants immediate entry to multi-party talks which
reopen next Tuesday and from which it is currently barred because
of IRA violence.
</P>
<P>
But Britain says Sinn Fein will be given a seat at the talks
when the IRA calls an irrevocable cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States has stepped up pressure
on the IRA to declare a cease-fire, arguing that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's landslide election victory presented an
opportunity to address the Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that as Sinn Fein went into the Belfast talks,
there were no indications that either side expected an early
breakthrough that might lead to a truce by the IRA, which is
fighting to end British rule over Northern Ireland and unite it
with Ireland.

others injured in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The Higher People's Court of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region announced in its final verdicts that Mahmut Abdurahman,
Jilil Bilali and six other persons were sentenced to death for
committing violent terrorist crimes "by extremely cruel and
criminal means."
</P>
<P>
The court also gave another four accomplices the death penalty
with a two-year repreive, life imprisonment and jail terms for
murder, robbery and larceny respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Urumqi Intermediate People's Court on May 16 issued its
verdicts regarding on the first instance, which occured on
February 25, saying that the 12-member gang placed five homemade
explosive devices on public buses in Urumqi, the capital city of
the autonomous region.

<P>
Three of the five explosive devices exploded, killing nine
passengers and injuring 58, who were all innocent local residents
of the Uygur, Han, Hui and Kirgiz ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Court investigations revealed that Mahmut Abdurahman, Abul'ahat
Memet and other members of the gang robbed local cab drivers, shop
owners, residents and pedestrians of Han nationality and the Uygur
ethnic group with knives and guns on eight occasions from December
18, 1996 to February 20, 1997. Nine persons were killed and two
injured in the incident.

The court said that Mahmut Abdurahman and his gang illegally
purchased three pistols and more than 90 bullets for their
criminal activities and stole 49,600 yuan-worth of public and

his gang had seriously endangered the life and property of the
people, the way in which the crimes were committed was absolutely
vile and the consequences extremely grave.

bank and currency.

<P>
The agreement, brokered by U.S. special envoy Robert Gelbard,

The bank will be able to issue the so-called "convertible mark"

However, Colum Murphy, spokesman for High Representative Carl
Bildt, said that the Bosnians still have to agree on the customs
policy law, and there remain some outstanding issues concerning

<P>
OTTAWA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest commercial bank
Royal Bank has delivered another record quarter profit, powered by
broad-based growth and lower loan losses.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ending on April 30, Royal's net income profit

That figure is one percent higher than that recorded in the

Royal said its biggest year-over-year profit gains came from
personal and business banking and from management of mutual funds,
brokerage and investment.

For the first half of fiscal 1997, Royal's net earnings reached
585 million dollars, 15 percent higher than the 508 million
reported the year before.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. filed a countersuit
against Digital Equipment Corp. and threatened to cut Digital off
from new technology and products, escalating the legal battle
between the two major companies.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that the actions show that
Intel is planning to use its marketing power to punish Digital,
which filed a patent-infringement suit against Intel May 12.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Intel-based computers accounted for 26 percent of
Digital's 8.4 billion U.S. dollars of product sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Intel's move was to force Digital to drop its
suit or come to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Intel is also asking for the return of some technical
information and prototypes given to Digital to engineer new
Intel-based computers.
</P>
<P>
But Digital, which said it expected the Intel move, could argue
that such a cutoff is anticompetitive behavior in violation of
U.S. antitrust laws, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Intel now controls 84 percent of the 21 billion U.S. dollar
market for microprocessors for personal computers. Some lawyers
said that Intel could face antitrust scrutiny from the Justice
department if it carries through on its threat.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Digital's next move could be to ask for a
preliminary injunction against Intel, preventing it from pursuing
allegedly anticompetitive tactics.

<HEADLINE> French Center-Right Softens Stand on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- France's outgoing center-right
majority has greatly softened its position on the European single
currency, saying that France does not have to cut its public
deficit to below 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GNP) by
the end of this year in order to launch the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"One will not reject the single currency because one would not
be exactly at 3 percent," Nicolas Sarkozy, former minister of the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic, said today.
</P>
<P>
Former President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin, who
is most likely the new prime minister if the center-right
maintains a majority in parliament after the second round of the
legislative elections, said on Tuesday that the 3 percent
objective would be "squarely a masochism" if it became an
"organized restriction."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the ruling center-right to hint at a
rewriting of the Maastricht Treaty which requires all candidates
for the Euro to cut their public deficits to below 3 percent of
their GNP by the end of 1997 in order to qualify.
</P>
<P>
This new position taking by the right makes it closer to the
Socialist Party over the issue of the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party said that although it does not oppose Euro,
it would not accept it if it brings about more belt-tightening to
the French people.
</P>
<P>
The efforts by the government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe to
cut public deficit over the past two years resulted in many
unpopular policies which were widely held responsible for the
serious setback suffered by the ruling majority in the first round
of the general election last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only three days away from the next decisive round of the
election, the ruling coalition of Rally for the Republic and Union
for French Democracy are doing all they can to prevent a left-wing
victory.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday again warned the French
voters against the risk of a cohabitation between him and the
left, which he said would "inevitably bring confusion" to the
socio-economic structure reform of France.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Lab Animal Breeding Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a group of
state-level lab animal breeding centers in Beijing and Shanghai so
as to initially build a lab animal breeding network by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shunchang, an official with the State Science and
Technology Commission in charge of scientific conditions, said
China will choose two lab animal research institutes in the two
cities as the bases of operations, and the central government will
provide funding for them.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at the ongoing three-day national conference on
scientific research conditions in Beijing that the two centers
will be in charge of developing the first groups of special
varieties of Chinese lab animals and those that will be used at
the country's lab animal breeding bases.
</P>
<P>
One of the major topics of the conference is to discuss in
detail China's plan on lab animal development between 1996 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
China is to further cooperation with foreign lab animal
institutes and welcomes foreign investment for projects in the
field, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The official said China is focusing on the development of
Chinese varieties of lab animals. They include miniature pigs,
trans-genic sheep and hairless mice. China is also to develop
trans-genic lab animals that carry human diseases.
</P>
<P>
Liu Rensan, 77, one of Chinese pioneers in lab animal research
and a researcher of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,
said the adult miniature pig is about 25 kilograms in weight.
</P>
<P>
He said that as many inner organs of the pig have similar
characteristics to those of human beings, using miniature pigs as
lab animals will play an important role in research of over 30
kinds of common diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disorders and hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
The trans-genic animals will be used for future production of
expensive pharmaceutical products for human beings.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that a rare variety of hairless mice found
only in China has a thymus gland that ordinary lab mice do not
have. The thymus-mice have have an immunity to disease, making
them suitable for disease research.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shunchang said China is also to build state-level lab
animal test organizations and draw up unified standards for lab
animal testing.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has about 2,100 units that breed or
use lab animals. China has an annual lab animal breeding capacity
of 13 million.

<HEADLINE> DPJ to Abolish Co-leadership System in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Upon requests from more and more
party members, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) today decided
to have a single leader while creating a post for the secretary
general in September, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, the second largest opposition force in Japan, has been
co-led by former Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan and
representative Yukio Hatoyama since it was established last
September. This situation has resulted in criticism inside and
outside the party that the dual leadership system leaves unclear
who should be finally responsible for party affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, Hatoyama will be the party leader and Kan
the secretary general because Kan has acted as a de-facto
secretary general in policy discussions with other
parties.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Holds Talks With British Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
held talks here today with visiting British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Derek John Fatchett on the latest development in
the region and the prospects of strengthening bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and British Ambassador
to Syria Basil Eastwood joined them in the talks, a Syrian
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the British minister reiterated Britain's
stance on the need to intensify efforts in order to achieve a
comprehensive and just peace in the region on the basis of the
Madrid resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said that Britain rejected Israeli settlement
policies. He asserted the importance of the resumption of
negotiations on the Syria track.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Syrian foreign minister stressed Syria's
adherence to a just and comprehensive peace in line with the
Madrid resolutions, and to the resumption of negotiations from
the point where Syria and Israel had reached before suspension.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara also underscored the gravity of the current Israeli
government policies and their negative consequences on the whole
peace process because of Israel's rejection of all international
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out the necessity of intensifying these efforts to
rescue the peace process and save the region from the
consequences of a collapsing peace process.
</P>
<P>
He called for the activation of the European role in the
region, expressing Syria's satisfaction with the British role in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the Syrian and British sides underlined the
importance of bilateral relations and the need to develop and
expand them in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The British minister arrived here Wednesday evening within the

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Stresses Macro-Control on Cocoon and Silk Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
strengthen the macro-control on its cocoon and silk industry so as
to avoid sharp ups and downs in the marketplace and ensure the
sound, steady development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The message was announced by Li Lanqing, vice-premier of the
State Council in a national meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Li urged government organizations in the industry to learn from
the experiences of the past years. China in 1995 produced 760,000
tons of cocoons, and silk reeling capacity in the year hit 4.5
million bundles, easily surpassing the market demand.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cocoon price plummeted in the second half of
1995 and the whole industry was plunged into a depression in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li said one of the key factors behind the market fluctuation is
weak macro-contorl capabilities of the governments in the main
silk-producing regions.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen their control, he urged the administrative bodies
to map out medium- and long-term development strategies and
corresponding yearly plans.
</P>
<P>
Also, state silk factories are required to store a certain
amount of raw silk so as to stablize the market flow of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the most important and also the most effective
way to supvervise the market is to formulate relevant laws and
regulations. "The government should execute its power in
accordance with the law while the enterprises should also protect
their own interests in accordance with the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on the enterprises agenda should be a push to adjust the
overall industrial mix and promote technical advances, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Dong Retires from Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A high fever caused by a
flu has forced the retirement of China's world number one Dong
Jiong from the ongoing World Badminton Championships here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The All-England Open men's champion started to have a high
fever running as high as 39.8 degrees Centigrade since Tuesday
night, which totally wiped out his hope to win his very first
world title,
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Dong, one of the heavy favorites for the world title
here, was due to face 10th-seeded Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of
Denmark in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Stuer-Lauridsen, who has never beat Dong since the Singapore
Open in 1994, was given a walkover and entered the quarter-finals
to meet the winner of the match between Malaysia's Ong Ewe Hock
and Heryanto Arbi of Indoensia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the news of Dong's sickness Wednesday night,
Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark said, "It is a
bad news. It is bad for the championships because Dong is one of
the best players here."
</P>
<P>
At last championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1995,
injury-haunted Dong was stopped by Joko Suprianto of Indonesia in
the second round.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Population Surpasses 70 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The 70 millionth person was born
today in Guangdong, one of China's densely-populated areas. But
the province vows to limit its total population under 73.71
million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong's economic development will partly depend on
successful control of its population. So Guangdong has to
reinforce implementation of the family-planning policy," State
Councillor Peng Peiyun, also director in charge of the State
Family Planning Commission, said at a meeting to mark the birth of
the 70 millionth person in Guangdong Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial sources, Guangdong plans to increase
its per capita gross domestic products (GDP) by eight-fold in the
1980-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
However, family planning officials worry that rapid growth of
population will be a great challenge to the province's ambitious
plan.
</P>
<P>
They said birth rate still remains very high in Guangdong, and
due to a large number of people of childbearing age, the province
will have 900,000 new births annually in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China has six provinces with a population over 60
million. Central China's Henan Province is the most heavily
populated, with 91.72 million people. East China's Shandong
Province ranks second, with 87.38 million.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province in southwest China, which previously had a
population of 110 million, became the third most populated
province after Chongqing with 30 million residents became a new
provincial-level municipality in March.

ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation Special Envoy
to Afghanistan, Norbert Holl, here today called on all warring
Afghan factions to settle their differences by means of
negotiations and not by fighting.
</P>
<P>
The UN Special Mission to Afghanistan offers its good offices
to bring the warring parties to discuss the possibilities of
solving the present critical situation and is prepared to

issued here this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here the Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia retreated on Wednesday from Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold
of defeated Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, after hours of heavy
fighting with forces loyal to General Abdul Malik, whose defection
to Taliban last week triggered Dostum's downfall.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that high-ranking Taliban officials including
foreign minister Mulla Mohammad Ghaus were arrested when rival
forces seized Mazar-e-Sharif after bitter fighting.
</P>
<P>
They are among thousands of people taken prisoners as the
Taliban militia retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif, four days after
entering the ancient northern Afghan city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the fighting began when the Taliban asked
forces loyal to Malik and Hezb-e-Wahdat forces linked to Malik to
hand over arms.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's CPI Hits Highest Level in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation, as
measured by the annual change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI),
hit its highest level in two years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued today by the Central Statistical
Service, the country's inflation had risen to 9.9 percent in April
from 9.6 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The April figure is the highest since June 1995, when inflation hit
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Howevewr, analysts predicted a sharp drop in inflation. Rob
Lee, the economic consultant to the Board of Executors Asset
Management of South Africa, said inflation was clearly ready "to
fall sharply in coming months and next year".
</P>
<P>
South Africa's inflation in the three months to April amounts to
8.5 percent, one percentage point lower than March's 9.5 percent and
3.3 percentage points lower than February's 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank's economic unit said the underlying trend for
inflation was lower and forecast an average of 9 percent for the year,
with a year-end figure of just below 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts view the three month average inflation rate as a good
indicator of underlying inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
In April a hefty increase in food prices and medical scheme
membership fees, higher cigarette prices following an increase in
excise duties in the March budget, and an increase in the petrol price
pushed conssumer inflation to a level slightly above that expected by
the financial markets.

<P>
The analysts said real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
might be a more reliable guide to monetary policy and the markets
at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The GDP figures for the first quarter will be released by the
government today.
</P>
<P>
"A real GDP growth figure below two percent for the first quarter
will prove that money supply and creadit figures had been artificially
high of late,' the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Support in Zimbabwe Lowest in SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) of
Zimbabwe said here today the level of government support to the
development of agriculture in the country is now one of the lowest in
the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
CFU Director Dave Hasluck said unless the government increased
funding for research and disease control, Zimbabwean farmers would
find it even more difficult to penetrate export markets in countries
where farmers enjoyed numerous incentives such as indirect subsidies.
</P>
<P>
''The level of support for agriculture in Zimbabwe has declined
substantially, and it is now among the lowest in 12 member countries
of SADC,'' Hasluck said.
</P>
<P>
He said support to agriculture was based on world trade
organisation provisions, which stipulate the level of funding for
such activities as extension services and research, provision of
cheap loans and the amount of direct and indirect tax farmers have to
pay when producing crops.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwean farmers wanted the government to substantially
increase funding for the Ministry of Agriculture's key activities,
such as research and development, as well as control of animal
diseases.
</P>
<P>
He added the government should, in the next fiscal budget,
rationalise allocation of funds to the Ministry of Agriculture so
that it could strengthen its role of supporting farmers. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Investors Confident in Japanese Equities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Institutional investors of the
United Kingdom have poured a net 307 million U.S. dollars into the
Japanese market, showed figures released this week by the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which is more than double the monthly average and
the highest single inflow to the sector for more than three years,
strongly shows that UK institutional investors have given a vote
of confidence to Japanese equities.
</P>
<P>
UK investment in Japan represented nearly nine percent of the
3.408 billion U.S. dollars worth of funds committed to unit trusts
and investment trusts in April.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the resurgence in interest in
Japanese equities has been the remarkable recovery in domestic
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
Large exporting companies in Japan have been reporting sharply
higher profits owing to a weak yen.
</P>
<P>
So far this year the average increase in profits has been
around 17 percent, against expectations of about 10 percent. As a
result, the Nikkei index has risen by almost 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the yen is now beginning to strengthen against the
dollar in the expectation that interest rates will be lifted some
time this year, fund managers are still convinced that this will
not damage export earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today wrote an
inscription for the China Foundation for Human Rights Development,
which opened its first meeting of the executive council here today.
</P>
<P>
The inscription read: "Seek common points in the global view on
human rights, safeguard the view of human rights held by
developing countries, advocate dialogues, refrain from
confrontation, and oppose interference with other countries'
internal affairs under the pretext of human rights."
</P>
<P>
Approved by the People's Bank of China and registered at the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, the China Foundation for Human Rights
Development was set up in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hua, Lu Dong and Zhu Muzhi, honorary president, president
and top advisor of the foundation, pointed out at today's meeting
that subsistence and development are two fundamental human rights
that first must be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"The undertaking of human rights should be developed on the
basis of safeguarding national dignity," they added.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reform and opening up drive in 1978, some
200 million Chinese have shed poverty. The National People's
Congress, China's legislature, has enacted over 300 laws and
regulations in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yanfeng, vice president of the foundation, said in a work
report that in the coming period, the foundation would mainly
focus on making more friends worldwide and taking more substantial
steps to promote China' human rights.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 20 enterprises and social institutions have
donated to the foundation, which now has a fund of more than 10
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Hopes Moscow to Remove Nuclear Warheads Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
has hoped that Russia would soon remove all the nuclear warheads
from the missiles targeting NATO countries, a German newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
What Russian President Boris Yeltsin perhaps wanted to do was
not only de-targeting nuclear missiles from NATO countries, but
also removing the nuclear warheads from them, Kinkel was quoted as
saying by the Freien Presse daily today.
</P>
<P>
De-targeting the missile from NATO members was nothing new, as
it had already been agreed upon between Russia, the United States
and Britain three years before, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was referring to a surprise announcement Yeltsin made in
Paris on Tuesday at the signing ceremony of the Russia-NATO
Founding Act.
</P>
<P>
"If we've understood him correctly, he wanted perhaps to
announce that he wants to remove the nuclear warheads from the
missiles," Kinkel said. He added that this must become a central
topic at the first meeting of the NATO-Russian Permanent Joint
Council, which would be created under the Founding Act.
</P>
<P>
He noted Yeltsin's announcement had at least removed fears that
Moscow would use NATO's planned eastward expansion as an excuse to
put greater emphasis on its own nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Manager Denies Match-Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korean badminton
team manager Kwon Seung Taik denied the match-fixing allegation
involving two South Korean mixed doubles pairs at the world
championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It can not be happened for team manager to instruct specific
players should win or lose their games in prior to that matches,"
Kwon said in a statement addressed to World Championships Referee
Torsten Berg Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
In a controversial second round match, unseeded duo Kim Dong
Moon and Ra Kyung Min spent only eight minutes to dispose of
eighth-seeded Ha Tae Kwon and Kim Shin Young 11-1, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
American Stan Hales, the tournament referee on duty who
suspected the two pairs did not play competitively, filed a report
to the championships management committee, which will discuss it
and report to the Council of the International Badminton
Federation.
</P>
<P>
IBF Chief Press Officer Sue Ashton said the IBF Council, which
will meet on Saturday to discuss the matter among other things,
could take disciplinary actions against the two pairs.
</P>
<P>
"We do not avoid the responsibility of our players' behavoirs
today, but we would notice that at least it is our coaching
staff's principle not to press any specific players for their
artificial winning or losing the games," Kwon said.
</P>
<P>
The winning pair was not seeded because 1996 Atlanta Olympics
mixed doubles gold medalist Kim Dong Moon and silver medalist Ra
Kyung Min only played together since earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Kwon said it was ironic that Kim and Ra, strongest among four
South Korean pairs, had to fight from the qualifying first stage
while the other three were placed in second stage.
</P>
<P>
Kwon complained Ra had played nine matches, seven in mixed
doubles and two in women's singles, in four days since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dong Moon and Ha Tae Kwon are "friendly team mates" who
were born in the same city of Chun Ju, graduated from the same
schools and now belongs to a university team, Kwon added.
</P>
<P>
Ha also played two events at the championships, who teams with
Kang Kyung Jin to compete as the fifth seed in the men's doubles
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in 14 months that the South Korean team
faces match-fixing allegations.
</P>
<P>
South Korea men's singles shuttler Kim Hak Kyun was banned for
three months by the country's badminton body after his
incompetitiveness against his Malaysian opponent at the Thomas Cup
Asian Zone preliminary between South Korea and Malaysia in
February 1996.

LUSAKA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice President Godfrey Miyanda
called here today on southern African countries to make deliberate
attempts at ensuring the participation of women and disabled persons
in the region in a wide range of sporting activities.
</P>
<P>
Opening the sixth Session of the Committee of Ministers of Culture,
Information and Sport of the Southern African Development Community

region."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the meeting will work out workable
programs to develop the region through cultural exchange, development
of effective information systems and promotion of sports in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SADC sector for culture, information and sport is
a vital cog in the SADC chain. It is SADC's mission to build a strong
and vibrant regional community that will facilitate close cooperation
and mutual understanding among people in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day session the ministers reviewed the progress in the
implementation of the programs mapped out at last session held last

BRUSSELS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- With full liberalization of the EU
telecom market set for next year, the European Commission wants to
ensure that all its members are up to date in fulfilling their
obligations under EU law and WTO agreement on basic telecom

The report was made on the basis of a proposal by EU
Commissioners Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert, responsible

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Due to poor showing of the industry
sector and exports, the Philippines' gross national product (GNP)
slowed down to 6.1 percent during the first quarter this year,
compared to 6.6 percent recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Socioeconomic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said robust growth in services and
agriculture sectors helped the economy sustain high growth.
</P>
<P>
Services and agriculture sectors increased by 6.6 percent and
4.4 percent respectively during the period, according to Habito.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, he said, the economy failed to
accelerate because of a big drop in industrial output and export
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Habito said industrial production shrank considerably from 6.1
to 3.8 percent due to labor-related problems in textile, rubber,
metal and manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
A sharp contraction in the output of mining and quarrying
sectors also significantly pulled down the industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, exports earnings in the first quarter
dropped sharply to 7.4 percent from 28.8 percent a year earlier
because of a decline in exports of major foreign reserve earners,
such as garments and crude coconut oil.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Speaks to Senior Chinese Officials at Party School (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Jiang Zemin said
today that China's socialist reform, opening-up, and modernization
drive must be guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark to
provincial and ministerial officials who ended their study today
at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang talked about Deng's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, about the primary stage of
socialism, about economic development and economic restructuring,
and about Party building.
</P>
<P>
After the death of Deng Xiaoping, all Party members, especially
senior officials, should be highly conscious and staunch in
upholding Deng's theory, and should not waver in the face of
whatever difficulties or risks, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that at the turn of a new century, the officials
should grasp opportunities to promote economic and political
restructuring, and bolster cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Deng's theory is the synthesis combining
Marxism with the practice in contemporary China, and the heritage
and development of Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical
period, and it is Marxism in contemporary China and is the new
stage of development of Marxism in China.
</P>
<P>
The theory adheres to emancipating mind and seeking truth from
facts, developing Marxism on the basis of new practice. It makes
clear the fundamental theoretical question of "what is socialism
and how to build socialism", and makes correct analysis and
scientific judgment about the characteristics of the present time
and international situation, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, the theory sums up the fresh experience in China's
reform, opening-up, and socialist modernization drive over the
past two decades, as well as other historical experience both at
home and abroad, and systematically answers the basic questions of
how to build, consolidate, and develop socialism in a country like
China with a backward economy and culture, Jiang Zemin said.
</P>
<P>
"Marxism is a science, and this is because it is strictly based
on facts all the time," Jiang said, adding that practical life
keeps changing, so Marxism must also be developed along with the
changes in life.
</P>
<P>
There is a question of the style of study here: to seek answers
from Marxist books or really study the practical problems in
contemporary China and the world with the point of view and
methods of Marxism, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought
must not be cast away, and the fundamentals would be lost if it is
cast away. Meanwhile Marxism must be applied to resolve new
and practical problems in China's reform, opening-up, and
modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is of no significance to talk about Marxism in ignorance of
the practice of the country and the new development of the times,
and there is no way out to study Marxism in an isolated and static
manner, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics are a unified
and scientific system, Jiang said, adding that in contemporary
China, adhering to Deng's theory is to adhere to
Marxism-Lennism-Mao Zedong Thought.

<P>
On the issue of the primary stage of socialism, Jiang said that
since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the
Party has analyzed the national conditions correctly and made a
scientific judgment that China is still at the primary stage of
socialism. This is an important base for Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as an
essential starting point for mapping out the Party's line,
policies and guiding principles, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The reason for reaffirming the issue today is that when
resolving various contradictions, clarifying uncertainties, and
justifying why these policies and guiding principles are
implemented rather than others, the key is to have a unified and
accurate understanding of the basic national conditions of primary
stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
When talking about proceeding from reality for everything, the
biggest reality is that China is and will be at the socialist
primary stage for a long period of time, Jiang said. A root cause
of the mistakes made in socialist construction before the Third
Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee is that some tasks and
policies surpassed the socialist primary stage, he said, adding
that a root cause of the successes achieved in reform, opening up,
and modernization drive during the past two decades is that the
government proceeded from the reality of the socialist primary
stage, redressed wrong concepts and policies that surpassed the
stage while refusing wrong suggestions of abandoning the basic
system of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Practice proved that we never deviated from the socialism but
building socialism in a down-to-earth way, he said, adding that by
doing so, socialism was really revitalized in China, and Chinese
people, who felt this by themselves, supported socialism more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
The major social contradiction at the socialist primary stage
is between people's increasing material and cultural demands and
the comparatively backward social production, the Chinese leader
said. The major contradiction, running through the whole process
of China's socialist primary stage and various aspects of social
life, has determined that our essential task is to develop social
productive forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party must keep a clear mind to unswervingly adhere
to the Party's basic line at the socialist primary stage and to
combine economic construction with keeping to the four cardinal
principles, reform, and opening-up during the entire process of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Chinese
leader stressed.

"The Party Central Committee has set forth a series of correct
guidelines, principles and policies for the reform and development
of the state-owned enterprises," he said. "Now the most important
thing is to further unify thinking and carry out these guidelines,
principles and policies in full".
</P>
<P>
Jiang required that experiments on establishing the modern
enterprise system be continued, and that major attention be given
to the reform and development of a number of large-sized
state-owned enterprises, which are connected with the "lifeline of
the national economy".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, concrete measures should be taken to solve
problems like unreasonable investment and repetitive construction,
and large enterprise groups that involve multiple regions,
sectors, and even countries, have multiple ownership and
relatively strong competitive force, should be established with
the help of the market force.
</P>
<P>
"Those small state-owned enterprises should also be further
invigorated by means of internal restructuring, agglomeration,
merger, lease, contracted management, shareholding, and property
transfer," he added.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of reforms in enterprises should be integrated
with the industrial restructuring, reforms of government
institutions, and the entire urban reform, Jiang said.

Talking about economic development and restructuring, Jiang

</P>
<P>
"The key to solving all problems China now faces lies in
self-development, to which the reform and opening up drive can
serve as a powerful impetus," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the period from now on until the first
decade of the next century is of critical importance for China in
its advancement to the third-phase strategic goal.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can successfully set up a relatively perfect system
of a socialist market economy and maintain sustained, rapid, and
sound growth for the national economy, are two major key topics to
which we must find a satisfactory solution during this period," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that it is of great significance to further
improve the ownership structure that makes public ownership as the
mainstay but allows the economies of multiple ownership to enjoy
common development.
</P>
<P>
"While making every effort to seek new forms of public
ownership that can greatly promote the development of the
productive force, we can also boldly make use of any managerial
methods and forms of organization that reflect the law of mass
production," he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the state-owned economy as "a pillar to China's
national economy", he noted that it is an important and extremely
arduous task facing the whole Party to speed up reforms in the
state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> British NCIS Asks for Powers to Fight Crime on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Criminal Intelligence
Service (NCIS) of Britain has called for extra powers to face the
growing threat of fraud, theft and terrorism to be conducted over
the internet in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The NCIS also has called for legislation on the theft of
electronic information, saying that internet crime is "the
policing challenge of the next millennium."
</P>
<P>
Albert Pacey, director general of NCIS, told a conference on
Wednesday that the internet was creating criminal opportunities
that might ultimately affect every citizen.
</P>
<P>
A new police beat was on the way of emerging on the information
highways, he added.
</P>
<P>
To establish an internet crime group within the National Crime
Squad will be possibly one of NCIS's suggestions to the police and
government in the summer, Pacey said.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe NCIS's push for increased
regulation is likely to meet some opposition from the software
industry and advocates of free speech.

Speaking on Party Building, Jiang Zemin said, "Our Party is
entrusted with a historic mission to lead people of all ethnic
groups of this country to push forward the cause of socialism with

<P>
"Strengthening and improving of Party leadership and further

</P>
<P>
"The task of Party building is still a very heavy one which
requires work to be carried out in many aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that "the primary task for Party building
is to work in a deep-going, solid and sustained way, arming the
whole Party with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"Hard efforts must be made to create an atmosphere of assiduous
reading, a mood of democratic discussion, a practice of seeking
truth from facts within the Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "all-out efforts will be made to
consolidate the leadership bodies at all levels of the Party and
the training of a contingent of high-quality cadres is another
heavy task for the Party building."
</P>
<P>
"Our leading cadres should be well versed in political theories
and policies, steadfast politically and competent professionally,"
he said, adding that "they should have good ideology and socialist
ethics and senior officials should take the lead in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"Anti-corruption is a serious political struggle that concerns
the fate of the Party and the state," he said, "and the Party will
make unremitting efforts to carry out the struggle vigorously."

<HEADLINE> World Oil Demand in 1997 to Decrease: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- International oil demand
during the second half of this year will decrease in comparison
with 1996 due to expected low demand from Asia and moderate
temperatures during the coming winter, an oil expert claimed.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the oil demand might also be attributed to the
slowness of refinery operations in international companies, Kuwait
News Agency today quoted Fareed Mohamadi, a senior executive at
Kuwaiti Petroleum Finance Company, as telling a seminar here last
night.
</P>
<P>
Oil demand increased in 1996 due to a surge in refining
capabilities in Asia, alterations in the U.S. stock and cold
winter in northern part of the globe. High demand pushed the oil
prices to rise by about 3 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohamadi attributed an increase in oil supply in
international markets to an expansion of oil supply from Latin
America, the North Sea in addition to Iraq's return to the oil
market.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
production has steadily grown over the past years and is projected
to climb by two million barrels per day to around 45 million
barrels per day in 1997.

TOKYO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Three-time champions Sweden entered
the semifinals after beating Spain 28-24 with a five-goal
avalanche in the second half extra time at the world handball
championships in Kumamoto of Japan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After drawing regulation time 21-21, the two sides added two

But the Swede soon dominated the second half extra time, with
Martin Fraendesjoe launching a go-ahead shot and Stefan Loevgren
making it two up, which virtually decided the match.

countered a Smanish attack to make it 26-23 and, although Talant
Dujshebaev pulled one back, it completed the scoring for the
Spaniards.

<P>
Loevgren duly made it 27-24, and then Fraendesjoe fired home a

<HEADLINE> Food Rations for Iraqis to Drop in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May (Xinhua) -- Iraqi trade ministry said today that
there will be a drop next month in the amount of food
distributions to Iraqis because of the delay of arrival food
stuffs under the deal with the United nations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the ministry told Iraq's official news agency
(INA) that in the light of quantities of food stuff arriving in
Iraq under the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by Iraq
and the U.N., the Iraqis can only receive five kilograms of wheat
flour without any rice a month.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official added that the amount of other daily
necessities such as vegetable oil, tea, and sugar will also be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
The ration system, which came into force after sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990 following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
stipulates that each Iraqi can get 2.5 kilograms of rice besides
wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
Each Iraqi last March was entitled to get seven kilograms of
wheat flour and 1.25 kilograms of rice before the arrival of food
supplied under the MOU, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food and other
daily necessities urgently needed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official attributed the drop next month to the
interference of the U.S. representative in the U.N. Sanctions
Council on Iraq that canceled a contract for the supply of
Vietnamese rice and some other contracts of the food supply.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Council has also delayed the approval of
several contracts for rice, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. government practises a "hostile"
policy of "deliberately harming the people of Iraq through
delaying the delivery of the food, medicine and other basic needs
to his country.

HAIKOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The capital of south China's island
province of Hainan has developed a scheme to turn itself into one
of the country's best tourist resorts.
</P>
<P>
Haikou is a picturesque tropical city on the north coast of the
island and has seen a boom in tourism in recent years, with both
domestic and foreign visitors increasing at an annual rate of 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
A local source says that the city had 2.2 million overseas and
Chinese tourists last year. This sharp increase has helped make
the city's airport one of the ten busiest in the country.
</P>
<P>
So, Haikou has been trying its best to become a major tourist
city, and the municipal government has begun various activities to
make its residents more conscious of how to be more civilized.
</P>
<P>
The city also has an extensive drive to improve its environment
and has set up more scenic spots and sights that will appeal to
tourists.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Ukraine Initial Agreement on Future Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Ukraine agreed on
Thursday on a security accord setting out terms for their future
relations.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-Ukraine Charter, which will be formally signed at a
NATO summit in Madrid in July, came just two days after the
signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Charter sets out the broad principles on which NATO's
relations with the former Soviet Republic will be based and
establishes a joint commission to enhance consultation between the
two parties on security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
This Commission is regarded as a lower-key forum than the
permanent joint council to be established between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The accord was initialed in the margin of NATO foreign
ministers' meeting in the Portuguese town of Sintra, where a final
round of negotiations was started over which countries will be
invited to join the alliance at the Madrid Summit.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Germany seem to prefer a small
enlargement of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the strong
favorites. But two other countries have an outside chance of
first-intake entry.
</P>
<P>
Romania is strongly backed by France, with Italy, Turkey and
Greece also arguing for a "southern" country to balance the more
northerly recruits.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that NATO's enlargement is no exclusively to
the north," said a French diplomat.
</P>
<P>
British sources acknowledged that Italy favored Slovenia, with
armed forces of only 5,500 and 50 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia's accession will conveniently provide a land corridor
for military movements between Italy and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
However, the same sources said that it was a question of
whether the alliance wanted to take in more than three states at
this stage.

<HEADLINE> Mentor Graphics Aims At Lasting Development in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Mentor Graphics Co., a major
supplier of electronic design automation (EDA) facilities in US,
announced today that it will further enhance its development in
China through expanding the technological cooperation with local
partners.
</P>
<P>
Wally Rhines, president of the Oregon-headquartered company,
said that the business of Mentor Graphics is expected to maintain
a two-digit increase on the Chinese market, which had on an annual
growth of 30 percent over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Wally said that from this year, the company will invite its
Chinese partner to join in the EDA design, and will establish
a technical training center here, so as to expedite the transfer of
the latest technical achievements to China.
</P>
<P>
These cooperative projects could absorb millions of US dollars,
the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial analysts said that the ambitious cooperation
program of Mentor Graphics signals the company's transformation
from a mere supplier of EDA products to a long-term partner in the
country's booming electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
To survive the increasingly rigorous competition with foreign
and local suppliers, only the role of a long-term partner can
guarantee the company with a stable market share in the Chinese
market, which ranks the most rapidly growing in the world, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Entering China in 1989, Mentor Graphics now has nearly 200
customers in China, with its products widely used in the fields of
telecommunications, computers, aviation, ship building, and
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
The company has founded training bases in Capital Steel and
Iron Corporation and Fudan University, and launched representative
offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, and Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Presidency Agrees on Law Concerning Bank, Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Presidency on
Wednesday reached an agreement on a draft law concerning the
central bank and the currency.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, brokered by U.S. special envoy Robert Gelbard,
called for the establishment of the central bank headquarters in
Sarajevo and branches in other places, to enable the Bosnian Serbs
drop their demand for two central banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bank will issue the so-called "convertible mark" in the
next few months, to replace other currencies in circulation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In an April agreement, the Bosnian side agreed to adopt the
"convertible mark" as a temporary currency, with a one-for-one
exchange rate with the German mark.
</P>
<P>
This central bank law is one of the legislations the United
States and its West European allies demand from the Bosnian
parties before an international donors conference can be held.
</P>
<P>
However, Colum Murphy, spokesman for High Representative Carl
Bildt, said that the Bosnians still have to agree on the customs
policy law, and some other issues concerning the currency and the
state budget.

buildings on campus can not be named after donors, according to a
decision made by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Names of any state-owned buildings of these schools are not
allowed to be auctioned by any unit or person.
</P>
<P>
Primary or middle schools, special education schools, or
kindergartens will have to be submitted for approval to the
educational administration at or above county level and the local
government of the same level.
</P>
<P>
On names of schools, the SEC said that no state-run colleges or

donors can have their names carved on stones on campus.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the SEC said the the decision was made to
strengthen management over naming school buildings. Some primary
and middle schools in some areas named their classrooms and other
school buildings after self-employed donors, causing adverse
effects in society.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Leaders Awarded 8 Million S'pore Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore High Court today
awarded a total of 8.075 million Singapore dollars (about 5.65
million US dollars) in damages to 11 ruling People's Action Party
(PAP) leaders in their defamation suits against defeated Workers'
Party candidate Tang Liang Hong.
</P>
<P>
Local television noted in its report that this was the largest
amount of damages ever awarded in defamation suits in the country.
It said that in a written judgment delivered by Justice Chao Hick
Tin today, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was awarded a total of 1.4
million Singapore dollars (about 980,000 US dollars) in three
cases.
</P>
<P>
Tang was reported as having called Goh a liar. Early this
month, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was asking for 2.15 million
Singapore dollars (about 1.49 million US dollars) in damages.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew was awarded a total of 2.3 million
Singapore dollars (about 1.61 million US dollars), and Deputy
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, a total of 1.3 million Singapore
dollars (about 910,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ruling PAP leaders asked on May 7, this year, for a total
of 12.9 million Singapore dollars, or about nine million US
dollars, in damages for the 13 defamation suits brought against
defeated Tang Liang Hong, who fled Singapore soon after the
general elections was over in early January.
</P>
<P>
According to a local television report, the amount was believed
to be the highest ever sought from an individual by Singapore's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
It said that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew was seeking 3.35
million Singapore dollars (about 2.33 million US dollars), and
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong demanded 2.1 million
Singapore dollars (about 1.46 million US dollars) in damages,
while eight other PAP members demanded the rest.
</P>
<P>
Senior counsels for the PAP leaders had been quoted as saying
that the case against Tang Liang Hong was extraordinary and
unprecedented, and hence the demand for high amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
They said the defamatory statements against their clients were
serious as they had hurt and undermined the integrity of important
men in Singapore, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The other PAP leaders included Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan,
and Ministers such as Lee Yock Suan and Teo Chee Hean. They were
reported to have been awarded damages ranging from 300,000 to
550,000 Singapore dollars, or 209,790 to 384,615 US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Marginally Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
marginally lower with global interest rate speculation still the
main directional influence.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 76.56 US cents from a close in
Sydney yesterday of 76.61.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Raven with Wespac said the Australian dollar had begun
the day's trading a touch lower.
</P>
<P>
But this afternoon it moved higher following the release of
Japanese April industrial output data. Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said industrial output fell 0.4
percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
The weaker data was seen as increasing the likelihood of Japan
increasing its official interest rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
A rate hike in Japan would give Japanese investors an incentive
to repatriate their investments, reducing demand for Australian
securities.
</P>
<P>
On the crosses, the Australian dollar was mostly weaker. It
closed at 89.04 yen from 89.18 yesterday, and at 1.3025 marks,
from 1.3067.

BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Xin Hua (New China) Life Insurance

million yuan in life insurance premiums over the past ten months.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Defense Minister on Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said today his government's move to allow US navy
ships to call at the country's ports is no indication that the
country's defense policy had changed.
</P>
<P>
The calling of US vessels at Port Klang last month was not
something unusual as it was an annual affair, he said in Johor
Baharu after a function, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Malaysia also allowed war ships from Britain,
France, Canada and the Netherlands to stopover in line with the
country's foreign policy to forge close ties with foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia, being a country strategically located at a
zone of peace and commerce, had always attached importance to
achieving economic growth and establishing friendly ties with
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We adopt a liberal attitude to any country wishing to use our
facilities so long as their policies are not contrary to our
interests," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while commenting on a report in
the Singapore Straits Times on May 24 that the Malaysian
government had switched its defense policy and that it would
cooperate with America in maintaining regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has bilateral defense arrangements with the US,
Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore under the Five Power
Defense Arrangement (FPDA).
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country also have bilateral cooperation
with other countries in the form of exchange program for military
personnel and training of recruits.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral arrangements would provide an opportunity for
Malaysian military personnel to work with multinational forces in
peacekeeping missions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cooperation Helps Handover, Children Say (1) By Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, May 29 (Xinhua) -- It is absolutely true that the
handover has been on everyone's tongue in Hong Kong as the historic
day is approaching. And children are no exception.
</P>
<P>
Without touching upon some more complex concepts, with which they
may gain a better understanding at an older age, about 150 upper
primary students at Hong Kong International School (HKIS)
paraphrased the handover at midnight on June 30 in their own way
-- performing a musical revue.
</P>
<P>
Chinese fables, dancing, singing and instrumental music, which
were all part of the very timely "Red Star Over Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the show, several students were wondering
aloud on the stage what the handover is all about.
</P>
<P>
"What's all this about 1997 anyway? My mom and dad talk about
it quite a bit!"
</P>
<P>
"Hey, my family talks about that too! I know it's already 1997,
but so far it seems OK to me."
</P>
<P>
Others gave a simple but clear answer to the handover question:
at midnight on June 30 this year, Britain will hand Hong Kong back
to China and that is called the handover.
</P>
<P>
They even told of the Opium Wars and other historical events,
which, happening in the last century, led to Hong Kong, "obviously
a part of China geographically," falling under the rule of a
country which is "on the other side of the world."
</P>
<P>
Then, through clever use of Chinese fables, the revue addressed
a number of handover-related concerns, all with emphasis on the
importance of understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One child told the fable of pandas which have to eat with
three-foot-long chopsticks. The pandas in purgatory are frustrated
because they can't possibly send food into their own mouths with
chopsticks of such a length; however, their counterparts in heaven
are happy because they use the chopsticks to feed each other. The
lesson? "Selfish people who don't cooperate create their own
difficulty."
</P>
<P>
Another child related the story of the crane and the clam. The
crane catches the clam, but then the two get into an argument.
While they are squabbling, a fisherman captures both of them. The
lesson here? "In the face of uncertainty, don't waste time
arguing."
</P>
<P>
The persuasive story-telling in English was enhanced by music,
old Chinese folksongs chorused in Chinese and dances.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets U.S. Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. relations face a good
opportunity for further improvement and development, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to U.S. Senator Max Baucus for visiting
China again, Jiang spoke highly of Baucus for his long years of
firm support for China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status.
</P>
<P>
On Baucus's recent motion on granting China the MFN
permanently, Jiang said, "It is a very wise and far-sighted move,
hereby we express our appreciation for it."
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that since the mid-1996, the Sino-U.S. ties have
scored some positive progress, with high-level exchange of visits
increasing and the economic and trade cooperation moving ahead
steadily.
</P>
<P>
"The China-U.S. relations are facing a good opportunity for
further improvement and development," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He continued, "I hold a firm belief that we could make the
Sino-U.S. ties retain long-term stability and continuous progress,
so long as both sides respect each other, seek common grounds
while preserving differences, expand cooperation, and make joint
efforts."
</P>
<P>
This should be done from the viewpoint of safeguarding the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, promoting the peace,
stability and prosperity in Asia-Pacific region, being far-sighted
and eyeing the future, and acting in strict accordance with the
principles set in the three joint communiques signed between the
two countries, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The MFN status, Jiang said, is a normal and non-discriminative
trade arrangement in essence.
</P>
<P>
Granting the MFN status to each other on the basis of equality,
Jiang noted, is the basis for promoting the normal economic and
trade ties between China and the U.S., and this is in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this issue can be settled in a thorough way at an
early date," he said, adding that "we have noticed that an
increasing number of the congressmen in the U.S. have recognized
the importance of this issue."
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. congressmen have voiced their unconditional support
for extending the MFN status to China, while some others stand for
a permanent grant, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. Congress play a positive and constructive
role in advancing Sino-U.S. relations, and in enhancing the
bilateral economic and trade cooperation," the Chinese president
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Baucus said that both the U.S. and China
are big powers with global influence, and they share a wide range
of common interests.
</P>
<P>
To increase cooperation between the two countries, he said,
will not only bring about huge benefits to the two peoples, but is
also conducive to peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason for his perseverant stand for tightening
cooperation with China and supporting the enhancement of bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, according to the senator.
</P>
<P>
The senator stated that currently he is actively pushing the
Congress to support U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to
renew the MFN to China for another year, and holds that China
should be granted the status permanently.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Baucus said that he also supports China joining the
World Trade Organization, hoping to solve this issue at an early
date under conditions that all sides could accept.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries, was among those present at the
meeting.

<P>
"Last week, we put all (of them) together and it was the first
time we went from the beginning to the end," said HKIS Music
Educator Lauralynn Smith, script writer and director of the revue.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old international school offers a "fine Chinese
study program" for students coming from some 40 countries and
territories to learn Chinese language and Chinese history. It also
sends students across the border, under an exchange program with
Yucai School in Shenzhen, to learn Chinese culture, dances and
songs.
</P>
<P>
On the moral of the revue, she said, "It is cooperation,
cooperation among children, among adults and between the two
countries (of China and Britain)."
</P>
<P>
"Many fables in the show may pertain to what's going on now."
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, a fable about a tiger and a fox -- the
fox borrows the tiger's terror by walking in the latter's company
-- suggests that the large size of China may be of benefit to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the children were afraid of the handover, Smith said,
"For the most part I know, I don't think so. Just as a child said
to me, we all know what it is all about."
</P>
<P>
The topic, however, seemed much more difficult for the innocent
boys and girls to comment, no matter how fluently they narrated
the history and the stories to the audience.
</P>
<P>
Kathryn, an American girl, said the handover will be a "big
event." She liked those fables because they taught her the
importance of people helping each other.
</P>
<P>
Another American girl, Meredith, felt that it is fair for Hong
Kong to be returned to China.
</P>
<P>
The excited performers all knew that it is a revue about the
handover, just as they were taught, but they were quite different
in their own predictions about the future.
</P>
<P>
Some said things will be different after the handover while
others believed things will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Chow from Taiwan thought the handover will bring "some
small changes in the long run." Another child believed that
Victoria Harbor will be renamed after the return.
</P>
<P>
Maybe, they had better stop arguing and listen to what the
revue suggested: "No one can predict the future, but if we all
remain confident and cooperate with each other, we students can
build a better tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Enthusiastic about Mideast Peace Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
who has temporarily taken a central stage in the Mideast
peace-making, hopes to bring together Israeli and Palestinian top
leaders at a tripartite meeting to restart the deadlocked peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On their front pages today, three local Arabic dailies here
highlighted Mubarak's statements to the CNN and the "Financial
Times" after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit failed to make a breakthrough in the peace process,
which deadlocked in mid-March after Israel broke ground for a new
Jewish housing unit in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the two leaders placed emphasis on the importance of
making concrete results, calling for continued discussions in the
coming weeks to find a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On whether he wanted the United States to play a greater role
in pushing forward the process, Mubarak said he believed that
President Bill Clinton was doing his best.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the next step would be a three-way meeting among
himself, Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the situation between the PNA and Israel,
Mubarak voiced belief that the two sides needed some time before
they could get together.
</P>
<P>
"We will reach something positive in the very near future if
the parties concerned respect their words," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, however, has ruled out the possibility of meeting with
Netanyahu at the current stage. He made the statement Wednesday
after he was briefed by Osama Baz, Mubarak's top adviser, on the
results of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that there were no prospects for such a
meeting unless Israel agreed to the Palestinian demand for a halt
to the settlement expansion in order to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Some Egyptian ideas, due for discussions during the Sharm
el-Sheikh summit, were made known to Arafat, according to Mubarak.
He said Netanyahu is also trying to offer new ideas which will be
conveyed to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak declined to reveal the details, but said the proposals
were not possibly be described as "fresh concessions."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Egyptian president described his Tuesday's
meeting with Netanyahu as better than his previous one in March.
"More flexibility" was seen in this meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the summit, Netanyahu conferred with his ministers
Wednesday to discuss his ideas for a permanent peace agreement
with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Urges Afghan Factions to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation Special Envoy
to Afghanistan, Robert Holl, here today called on all warring
Afghan factions to settle their differences by means of
negotiations and not by fighting.
</P>
<P>
The UN Special Mission to Afghanistan offers its good offices
to bring the warring parties to discuss the possibilities of
solving the present critical situation and is prepared to
facilitate contacts between both sides, Holl said in a statement
issued here this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here the Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia retreated on Wednesday from Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold
of defeated Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, after hours of heavy
fighting with forces loyal to General Abdul Malik, whose defection
to Taliban last week triggered Dostum's downfall.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that high-ranking Taliban officials including
foreign minister Mulla Mohammad Ghaus were arrested when rival
forces seized Mazar-e-Sharif after bitter fighting.
</P>
<P>
They are among thousands of people taken prisoners as the
Taliban militia retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif, four days after
entering the ancient northern Afghan city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the fighting began when the Taliban asked
forces loyal to Malik and Hezb-e-Wahdat forces linked to Malik to
hand over arms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Polls Generally Peaceful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite rumors of tension and
violences in Jakarta and other places, Indonesia's sixth general
election that concluded this afternoon is generally peaceful and
orderly.
</P>
<P>
H. Humaidy, head of the information office of the general
election institute, told Xinhua that it is estimated that about 90
percent or more than 90 percent of the 124.7 million registered
voters nationwide cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the high turnout to the political maturity of the
voters, saying it reflected their concern about the future of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He described the polls, which began at 8:00 a.m. and ended at
2:00 p.m., as 'generally peaceful and orderly'.
</P>
<P>
This morning, President Soeharto along with his family and 300
other residents cast their ballot at a polling station on Cendana
street in Menteng district, central Jakarta. And then the
president inspected some polling stations in Jakarta, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Try Sutrisno and all the cabinet ministers also
went to the polls near their residences today, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some political observers predicted that, like previous
elections, the ruling party Golkar will take the lead over its two
small rivals -- the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The Golkar has won all the five general elections since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The first results will be announced at 7:00 p.m. and the final
results are expected some time in the middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Reported Final Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today adamantly denied reports that Israel would hand
over about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) under a new permanent settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israel Radio this morning, Netanyahu
stated that the report concerning the new plan, which appeared in
today's Haaretz newspaper, was not based on facts, and to date,
he has yet to disclose his plans to anyone.
</P>
<P>
According to Haaretz, which published a large map to detail
the division of the West Bank under the new proposal, Israel
will maintain the control of the area east of the 1967 Green
Line, up to and include the first main mountain range.
</P>
<P>
Israel would also keep the control of a 15-kilometer strip west
of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said the only maps that exist to date are
"in his head" and they have not been put into paper yet.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israel's security cabinet held its
first meeting Wednesday on final-status talks with the
Palestinians, and had decided to continue its discussions over
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Following the discussions, the security cabinet is expected
to determine Israel's red line on the permanent settlements with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ami Ayalon, head of the Israeli General Security Service, told
the security cabinet that the Palestinians will continue to
maintain a tough stand on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai stressed that
final-status talks should be approached extremely slowly "in a
gradual and well thought-out way."
</P>
<P>
He added that he would make sure no Israeli army officers are
involved in the political discussions.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares drifted in
trading today but still managed to finish in positive territory
and record fresh record highs.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 5.4 points higher at 2590.6,
just off a record intraday high of 2591.5.
</P>
<P>
"(The market) was really trying to find direction with a slight
negative lead from offshore last night and options (expiry)
bringing some volatility," Wilson HTM advisor Chris Cairns said.
</P>
<P>
Cairns said a firming of the bond market in afternoon trading
also provided support for the share market on a valuation basis.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index rose 4.1 points to 1487.8 and the all
industrials increased 7.2 to 4029.1.
</P>
<P>
Peake Lands Kirwan's Bill Richmond said the market was also
boosted by a rise in BHP's share price following an announcement
this morning that it had found produceable hydrocarbons at its 45

</P>
<P>
Its shares rose 21 Australian cents to 18.60 Australian
dollars.

<P>
Selected petroleum stocks also performed well with Oil Search
gaining 14 to 3.26 US dollars.
</P>

The gold index ended 1.8 points weaker at 1550.7 while gold
bullion closed in Sydney at 345.15 US dollars an ounce, against

</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, leading bank stocks succumbed to
profit-taking. "At the moment I think people are sitting back
waiting to see what's going to happen next, there was a bit of
profit-taking today, especially in NAB," Cairns said.
</P>
<P>
NAB shares fell 11 to 18.55 Australian dollars while Westpac
dropped eight to 7.12 Australian dollars, Commonwealth Bank shed
12 to 14.38 Australian dollars and ANZ decreased two to 8.73

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Invite Bids for Chopper Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will invite international
tenderers on May 30 to compete for an attack helicopters project
of 3.5 billion U.S. dollar worth aimed at enhancing the country's
defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News today quoted defense sources as
saying that seven helicopter companies from South Africa, Italy,
France, Germany, Russia as well as the United States would take
part in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM), which
is in charge of this project, will ask these companies to
provide Turkey with their export licenses and concrete technical
schemes for the production of 50 attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
These foreign companies will be asked to submit their own
proposals by late October, when the SSM will choose four out
of the seven companies, and the last winner of the defense
project will be announced in 1998, according to paper.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the U.S., which is criticized by
Ankara for imposing an arms embargo on Turkey, was not excluded
from the bidding program.
</P>
<P>
The well-known U.S. defense giants, such as Bell-Textron,
McDonnell Douglas as well as Boeing, will provide their advanced
design plans to Turkey, according to the same defense sources,
who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
The SSM, however, has told the U.S. tendering companies that
Turkey will not want to face unnecessary difficulty if a U.S.
tenderer wins.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration was reported to have suspended for
months the delivery of Turkey's three frigates and four navy Sea
Hawk helicopters by not sending their notification draft to the
U.S. Congress due to its dissatisfaction with Turkey's human
rights record and stand on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Turkey wants to increase the number of its
armed helicopter fleet as part of the efforts to strengthen the
comprehensive combativeness of the Armed Forces.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: African Countries Strive to Attract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
actively taken and are taking flexible policies to attract more
foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980's, most African countries have established
national regulatory frameworks conducive to foreign investment,
in contrast to their inward-looking and unfavorable policies
toward FDI adopted in the 1960's and 1970's.
</P>
<P>
According to the "world investment directory on Africa in
1996" released here recently, between 1982 and 1987 alone, about
one half of the African countries either introduced FDI codes or
guidelines, or made adjustments to existing guidelines to attract
more investments.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's, the
move towards greater openness to FDI spread to many other African
countries that have since then liberalized their policies through
legislative changes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the limitation of foreign investors
participation in enterprises and ownership restrictions have been
removed by most African countries in recent years.
</P>
<P>
For example, Ghana's 1985 investment code reduced the number
of industries closed to FDI from 24 to 2, then the 1994
Investment Promotion Center act allowed foreign investors to
invest in all industries with a few special requirements for
investment in mining and petroleum.
</P>
<P>
State disengagement from economic activities has been
undertaken at different paces in different African countries.
This has also created a favorable climate for attracting FDI.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Chad, Mozambique and Uganda have embarked on
the outright sale of public enterprises, while Egypt, Ethiopia
and Tunisia have chosen to follow a very cautious and gradualist
approach to privatization and the reform parastatals.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, numerous African countries have set up
"one-stop investment shops", whose major function is to provide a
one stop approval facility within the government bureaucracy,
such as the Investment Center of Eritrea, the National Investment
Board of Gambia, the Investment Promotion Center of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The objective of such "one-stop investment shops" is to
eliminate time delays associated with an approval process that
requires the cooperation of different government departments.
</P>
<P>
Many African governments have also recognized that their
foreign exchange control laws were a strong disincentive to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
And the solution adopted in many countries is to guarantee
foreign investors the right to repatriate capital and profits,
thus exempting them to a certain extent from the otherwise
restrictive foreign exchange regimes.
</P>
<P>
So far, many African countries have introduced foreign
exchange retention schemes for investors. An even more effective
solution to this problem has been the introduction of liberalized
currency markets as part of structural adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania have removed completely
foreign exchange restrictions and have introduced exchange
bureaus to handle foreign exchange transactions no longer
controlled by the central banks.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980's, many African countries have taken fiscal
incentives to attract foreign investors. In Tanzania, for
example, the investment promotion act of 1990 provides for
foreign investors to negotiate tax concessions individually with
the Investment Promotion Center.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya and other
countries also have their own ways to attract foreign investment,
such as providing a tax holiday of up to 15 years for projects
deemed to be in the public interest, putting particular emphasis
on small and medium sized enterprises, giving special incentives
to those who invest in the lesser developed regions.
</P>
<P>
Besides tax and duty concessions, many African countries have
tried to attract FDI through generous incentives available to
foreign affiliates in export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
Incentives often include exemptions from import and excise
duties as well as from income tax, free repatriation of capital
and profits, investment and export finance at preferential rates,
serviced industrial estates, favorable labor legislation and
guarantees against nationalization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as part of their policy to improve investment
climate and attract FDI, many African countries have concluded
bilateral investment treaties. By June 1996, about 260 bilateral
investment treaties had been signed by African countries.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts of African countries have promoted foreign
investment in the poor continent. The FDI in Africa hit five
billion and 4.7 billion US Dollars in 1994 and 1995 respectively,
sharply up from 2.8 billion annually between 1986 and 1990 on the
average and 1.7 billion annually from 1981 to 1985.

<HEADLINE> Shells Hitting Buldon Fired by Philippine Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Several mortar shells killing 11
people last March in Buldon, Maguindanao province, the southern
Philippines, were fired by the military, a chief negotiator said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the final results of an investigation, Fortunato Abat,
head of the government peace panel, told a press conference that
the 105mm or 155mm shells came from an area occupied by government
troops which were positioned there to fight the rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Group (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Abat, however, added that the casualties were not school
children as reported earlier. Instead, they were members of a MILF
faction who were having a class inside the military camp of the
MILF at that time.
</P>
<P>
The peace panels of the government and the MILF have been
blaming each other for the March 16 killing. The incident has also
become a stumbling block to the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Abat also announced that he plans to
recommend the rebels to stop talking about the Buldon incident and
start to discuss a general ceasefire in their next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the two sides signed an interim ceasefire agreement,
but the truce was often broken by sporadic clashes between the two
forces which just kept a four-kilometer distance with each other.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are scheduled to hold their fifth
round of low-level talks on June 17-18. They have not made any
substantial progress yet in their first four rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement with the
government last year.
</P>
<P>
With 12,000 members, the MILF proclaimed itself the biggest
rebel group in the country at present.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Agree to End War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leaders reached an
agreement here today on holding peaceful talks to end the civil
war that has ravaged the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation agreement was signed by leader of the Somali
Salvation Alliance Ali Mahdi Mohamed and leader of the Somali
Congress Party Hussein Farah Aideed after their latest rounds of
consultation in the Egyptian capital since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They made the announcement after meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt has been involved in mediating an
end to the six-year-old Somali crisis in past few months.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will work for holding the
conference of national reconciliation inside the country in the
coming months to remove the remaining differences among the Somali
people.
</P>
<P>
"All parties are to be invited to join the agreement which is
aimed at achieving stability, security and unity all over the
country," said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also hammered out a four-point plan for ending
hostilities in the divided capital city of Mogadishu and setting
up a joint administration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement appeals to all Somali people to "forget and
forgive about the past, to open a new page of tolerance and to
work together for the good of the people and the country."
</P>
<P>
Somali faction leaders had failed to honor their agreements
signed previously.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late president Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several unsuccessful peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers' Spring Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
16 NATO member states started today a one-day meeting in the
Portuguese town of Sintra, discussing all the questions to be on
the agenda of NATO's Madrid Summit in July.
</P>
<P>
The ministers' discussion will especially focus on the
enlargement issue in a bid to make consensus over the countries
which will be invited to join the alliance at the Madrid Summit.
</P>
<P>
It is almost certain that Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic will join the western military club in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic at the meeting is the internal reform of
the alliance, especially developing Europe's own security
identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the new Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
will be launched, to replace the existing North Atlantic
Co-operation Council.
</P>
<P>
The new Council is designed to widen the scope of talks between
NATO and 27 neutral and former East bloc nations and former Soviet
republics, to cover issues ranging from arms control and nuclear
proliferation to fighting terrorism and defense-related
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Sintra will also seek to finalize an agreement
between NATO and Ukraine similar to that just signed with Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials hope for a formal agreement with Ukraine at the
Madrid Summit.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda is NATO's dialogue with Mediterranean
countries and discussing the situation in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Meet for Expansion Countdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
16 NATO member nations began on Thursday the countdown to the
alliance's expansion into eastern Europe at their half-yearly
meeting which will focus on the short list of candidates eager to
join the organization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, meeting in the Portuguese town of Sintra, will
discuss the matter on the basis of a report by NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, which, according to NATO sources, is
structured in three parts: the results of the individual dialogue
between NATO and 12 countries interested, the results of the
military assessment made by NATO's military authorities and the
"initial" results of the study on the costs of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Germany seem to prefer a small
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the strong
favorites. An invitation to those three countries will be formally
issued at a NATO summit in Madrid in July.
</P>
<P>
But two other countries have an outside chance of the
first-intake entry. Romania is strongly backed by France, with
Italy, Turkey and Greece arguing for a "southern" country to
balance the more northern recruits.
</P>
<P>
British sources acknowledged that Italy-favored Slovenia, with
armed forces of only 5,500 and 50 tanks, could join NATO "without
any problem."
</P>
<P>
Slovenia's accession will conveniently provide a land corridor
for military movements between Italy and Hungary, leading to a
closer relationship with Croatia and Bosnia, where NATO
peacekeeping forces may be involved for years to come.
</P>
<P>
However, it was still a question whether the alliance wanted to
take in more than three states at this stage, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Since no formal decisions will be made at today's meeting in
which countries should be included in the first accession group,
Solana is expected to spend the month of June seeking solutions as
well as a final consensus on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases List of Constituencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON ) yesterday released the list of constituencies for the
coming elections under the transition to civil-rule program.
</P>
<P>
The commission divided the whole country into 109 senatorial
districts, 360 federal constituencies and 989 state constituencies,
adding up to 1458 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Provisional Ruling Council rose from yesterday's
meeting in Abuja without a decision on the recommended amendment to
the transition program.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to leave the issue to the next meeting two
weeks later, local media said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment recommended by the countries' five political parties
and the electoral commission is that both the governor and state
assembly elections originally set for this year will be shifted to
1998 without changing the October 1 date for the inauguration of an
elected civilian government.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Meet to Prepare Madrid Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINTRA, Portugal, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
16 NATO member nations started today their half-yearly meeting
which will deal with all the questions to be on the agenda of
July's NATO summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"Our meetings in Sintra demonstrate that NATO is well on track
for the 21th century...and remains determined to meet the
challenge of change," NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in
his opening statement at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the foreign ministers will mainly
discuss the issue of NATO's eastward expansion, trying to make
consensus over the countries that will be invited to join the
alliance at the Madrid Summit.
</P>
<P>
It is almost certain that Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic will join the organization in the first wave, but Romania
and Slovenia also have an outside chance of the first-intake entry.
</P>
<P>
"No country has taken a decision as to who should be in the
first group to be invited," a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
Since no decision on the name list will be made at Thursday's
meeting, Solana is expected to spend the month of June seeking
solutions and a final consensus.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic at the meeting is the internal reform of
the alliance to develop Europe's defense identity within the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will continue to work on the rearrangement of
the alliance's command structures, which may be finalized by NATO
defense ministers when they meet two weeks later in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The United States still refused to give up the control of
NATO's Southern Command, based in Naples, Italy, and traditionally
held by an American admiral.
</P>
<P>
France, which left NATO's integrated military command in 1966,
has been pressing for the Naples' command to be handed over to a
European officer, reflecting the desire on the continent to
develop its own security identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
In Sintra, the new Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council will be
set up to replace the existing six-year-old North Atlantic
Co-operation Council.
</P>
<P>
The council, which will group the 16 NATO members and 27
partners countries, is aimed at promoting political consultations
and military cooperation between NATO and its partners.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also announce the new Enhanced Partnership
for Peace (PfP) Program, which will enable partners to be more
involved in the PfP activities.
</P>
<P>
They will furthermore examine Russia-NATO and Ukraine-NATO
relations. Also on the agenda are NATO's dialogues with
Mediterranean countries and the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovena.

<HEADLINE> Strike Brings Berlin Airports to Standstill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A warning strike by airport
employees brought three airports in Berlin to a 3-hour standstill
before it ended at 8:00 a.m. (local time) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Transportation Trade Union OETV, about
1,000 employees at the Tegel, Tempelhof and Schoenefeld airports
walked off their jobs at 5:00 a.m. to put pressure on the ongoing
negotiations over an agreement to guarantee jobs for about 2,100
airport employees.
</P>
<P>
The strike caused dozens of flights to be cancelled or
postponed and made 3,000 passengers wait at the airports,
a spokesman of the German Lufthansa airline said.
</P>
<P>
Losses resulted from the strike could be well above 100,000
German marks (60,000 U.S. dollars), the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivorie's FM Expected to Withdraw Bid for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Cote d'Ivorie's Foreign Minister
Amara Essy, the only rival of OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim to vie for the highest position of the organization, is
expected to withdraw his bid.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the current ministerial meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) said today that Francophone
African countries had insisted on the selection of Essy to be
OAU's chief, while English-speaking countries wanted Salim to
maintain the position.
</P>
<P>
OAU officials are busy consulting with delegates of both sides
on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting in a bid to head off
"an internal crisis", conference sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said some French-speaking African countries, in
view of the situation, had reluctantly agreed to allow Salim to
serve the third term.
</P>
<P>
Abani Sani Ibrahim, a delegate from Niger, hinted in an
interview with Xinhua that a number of French-speaking countries
would probably shift their support to Salim for the sake of
maintaining OAU's unity.
</P>
<P>
"Salim does have more chances to win the third term," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim, a Tanzanian, seeking support for an unprecedented third
term in office, said earlier that he was optimistic to win a
third term.
</P>
<P>
The current OAU chief said he was happy and proud with the
achievements of the organization during the past two decades he
had worked for it. But French-speaking countries said it should
be their turn now to have someone of their own origin take over
the position.
</P>
<P>
The election of a new OAU chief is one of the major topics on
the agenda of OAU's 33rd summit scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Salim and Essy had caused jitters that
Francophone and English-speaking African countries would split
over who will lead the OAU in the next four years.

<HEADLINE> Much Money Spent on Jewish Settlers' Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A sum of 250 million shekels
(about 76 million U.S. dollars) has been poured into beefing up
security in settlements throughout the West Bank over the past
three and a half years, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Yitzhak Aviram, head of the regional defense
in the Central Command of the Israeli army as saying that 97
percent of the plans to enhance security in the settlements have
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
These include special electronic fences with warning devices,
security lighting, bypass roads, special units on call in 80
percent of the settlements, bullet proofing for school buses,
and the purchase of security vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, internal paging systems have been installed in
settlements and 300 soldiers deployed guarding settlement
entrances, said Aviram.
</P>
<P>
This summer, Civil Guard units accompanied by a policeman
will start operating in the settlements of Alfei Menashe, Betar
Illit, Immanuel, Beit Ariel, and Karnei Shomron in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
These units, stressed Aviram, will only be allowed to operate
within settlements.
</P>
<P>
One of the most outstanding achievements cited by Aviram is
the bullet-proof supplied to 58 regional council buses and 41
public buses that transport children to and from school, at a
cost of 400,000 shekels (more than 100,000 dollars) for each
bus.
</P>
<P>
He added that more funds are required to equip an additional
50 buses with bullet-proof.
</P>
<P>
An option available to settlers is the installation of "panic
buttons" in vehicles that sends radio signals to one of the nine
communication centers in settlements throughout the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
The button will automatically register on a computer screen at
the center, pinpointing the location of the vehicle, thus
assistance can arrive quickly, as soon as the driver presses it
in any need, Aviram said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 settlers are hooked up to the system, paying a
subsidized sum of 37 shekels (11 dollars) per month, while the
Defense Ministry spends an additional 60 shekels (some 22
dollars) on each subscriber monthly.
</P>
<P>
By next year 13 paramedic ambulance stations will operate in
the West Bank, instead of the current five in operation today,
said Aviram. Moreover, four firefighting units are to be set up.
</P>
<P>
Regarding weapon permit applications, Yitzhak stressed that
out of 4,000 requests for permits in the territories, only 170
were rejected, about 10 by the General Security Service.

<P>
Tam said that more than 150 trade delegations from the Chinese
mainland attended the exposition and they occupied a third of the

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Desert Now A Cotton Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tarim Basin in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has become the country's
high-yield cotton producer even though more than 60 percent of the
area is desert.
</P>
<P>
The 530,000-sq.-km. basin is also one of China's driest area,
and the world's second largest moving desert, the Taklimakan, is
located in the region.
</P>
<P>
The harsh natural conditions for centuries impeded the
development of agriculture. But today, the region is far from
being one of China's poorest thanks to the capital government has
put into it.
</P>
<P>
Improved water conservation has also helped, and for several
years running, the region has had double-digit growth in cotton
and grain production.
</P>
<P>
The long sunny hours, sufficient heat, and large tracts of
uncultivated land have turned out to be favorable for cotton.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the region has 563,300 hectares
of cotton with a per-hectare yield of at least 1,275 kg, twice the
national average, and 180,000 hectares of that are high-yield
cotton, with a per-hectare yield of 1,500 kg.
</P>
<P>
To boost production in Xinjiang, the Chinese government has
started a 9.4-billion-yuan project to build a state cotton
production base there, with the Tarim Basin to produce 60 percent
of the region's cotton.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the region's farmers' income is now from
cotton.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Greater Summer Farming Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
urged rural officials and farmers to work hard and make a success
of summer farming, achieve a big summer grain harvest, and lay a
good foundation for the whole year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made the call during
recent inspection tours of rural areas of Jiangsu and Henan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier visited Tongshan, Peizhou, Peixian, and
Fengxian of Jiangsu province in east China, and Xinzheng City of
central China's Henan province, and inspected high-yield wheat
fields, upgraded moderate- and low-yield farmland, vegetable
growing farms and water control facilities, and visited rural
families.
</P>
<P>
Though a bumper harvest of wheat seems likely, rural areas must
not slacken their vigilance, but should get well prepared for any
unexpected natural disasters instead, Jiang urged.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also stressed that more attention should be
given to wheat in the late growing period, and local officials of
rural areas should help organize farmers to harvest wheat at an
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
While calling for full use of machines in farming to ensure a
safe wheat harvesting and storing, Jiang also urged to ensure a
proper growing area of grain and cotton, to be well-prepared for
any possible natural disasters, as well as to encourage a wide
application of sophisticated and practical agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is in charge of rural affairs in the State Council,
the country's highest governing body, also called on local
officials to pay attention to protecting farmers' enthusiasm in
farming.

<HEADLINE> GCC Ministers to Discuss Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the six
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states will meet in Saudi capital
Riyadh Saturday to assess possible changes in their ties with
Iran following the election of moderate Mohammad Khatami as its
next president.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said here today that the two-day meeting, the
63rd of its kind since the founding of the regional political and
economic bloc in 1981, will also cover a host of regional, Arab
and Islamic issues of common interests.
</P>
<P>
The issues include the stalled Middle East peace process,
developments in Northern Iraq owing to two-week-old Turkish
military incursion and the extent of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian President-elect Khatami was accorded
congratulations by leaders of the GCC members including Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the ministers would discuss possibilities of
improving ties with Tehran despite that most Gulf Arab countries
would adopt a wait-and-see policy.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab countries accused Iran of interfering in their
internal affairs and voiced concern over its military build-up,
although Tehran expressed willingness to improve ties with its
Gulf neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem with Iran is trust," said a Gulf source, adding
that Iran's outgoing "President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was first
hailed as a pragmatist, but after two terms the ties are still
marred by suspicions."
</P>
<P>
The session is expected to touch upon the issue of territorial
sovereignty of the three Islands - the Greater and Lesser Tunbs
and Abu Musa - a cause of dispute between Iran and UAE.
</P>
<P>
Iran's president-elect reiterated in his first press conference
Tuesday that the Islands belonged to Iran but called for
bilateral talks to settle the row.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the stalled Middle East peace process, the
source said the GCC ministers would assess the situation in
view of Tuesday's summit between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At its latest meeting in Riyadh last March, the GCC
ministerial council called for taking steps aimed at promoting
the peace process and bringing Israel to stop its construction of
new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Plays Greater Role in Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yu Dabo)
</P>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 1 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) opens next week as the
organization gears up for a greater role in promoting regional
cooperation in attaining lasting peace and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government leaders of African countries
will attend the summit that comes as the continent is trying even
harder than before to rid itself of the nightmare of internal
conflict for the sake of sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen the OAU successfully enhancing its
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of peace and stability in some conflict-torn
countries marks a significant change on the continent. Since the
previous summit, the peace process in Africa at large, has been
gaining momentum under the mediation of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Angola, where a prolonged civil war had wrecked havoc on the
country, has entered a new era with the establishment of a
broad-based national reconciliation government in April this year.
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, the peace process has been further consolidated
and the country has embarked on the road of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In anarchy-prevalent Somalia, warring factions signed a peace
accord earlier this month, blessing the country with a new opportunity of
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
In Liberia, rival forces have laid down their weapons and are
now busy preparing for elections to pave the way for rebuilding
the country.
</P>
<P>
In Central Africa Republic, the government has managed to maintain
stability after successfully handling one mutiny after another.
</P>
<P>
Also encouraging is the latest development in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), where the dictatorship of
former president Mobutu Sese Seko has been brought to an end and
the country bid farewell to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU's secretary general, told Xinhua in a
recent interview that OAU had made its due contributions to the
defusion of the crisis in former Zaire. If it had not been for
OAU's mediation, the crisis would have led to more bloodshed, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Xi'an Targets at Opening Wider to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of northwest
China's Shaanxi province is stepping up its drive of opening wider
to the outside world, so as to seize more chances to develop local
economy.
</P>
<P>
The city, a world-famous tourist destination owning the
terra-cotta warriors and horses, has launched a series of tourism
and trade promotion efforts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city has held the Xi'an Ancient Cultural and Artistic
Festivals annually for six years running ever since 1992 and has
hosted a lot of international trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
It has aroused the interest of many powerful international
companies and consortiums from the Netherlands, Britain and Japan.
</P>
<P>
To date, Xi'an has set up 1,662 overseas-funded enterprises
which are from 45 countries and regions, with foreign investment
totaling 4.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This June, the city government will send a special delegation
to Singapore, Malaysia and some European countries to invite
investment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Plays Greater Role in Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The OAU has also been active in
containing disputes between neighboring countries. Under the
organization's influence, the presidents of Sudan and Uganda met
in May to abandon their feud for mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun and Nigeria, at loggerheads over the Bakasi Peninsula
sovereignty, have refrained from further military conflict,
thanks to the OAU's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the number and scale of conflicts in
Africa have been declining, the political situation still "merits
the major concern of the OAU".
</P>
<P>
The recent coup overthrowing the elected president and civil
government in Sierra Leone, which occurred just days before the
OAU summit, shows that peace and stability in parts of the
continent are fragile and need to be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
African countries, however, are more determined than ever
before to prevent, contain and resolve the internal conflicts
that have plagued the continent for long.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU's secretary general, told Xinhua in a
recent interview that the organization will continue to give
priority to the achievement of peace and stability in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU should seriously endeavor to develop and enhance its
capacity in the field of peacekeeping," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its future peacekeeping efforts, the organization
will participate in peacekeeping operations either under the
aegis of the United Nations or in direct involvement in the
establishment of an African intervention force under the OAU
command, OAU officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
They said the proposed force will at first have a minimum
manpower strength of 3,000, which in the long run could rise to a
much higher number. The stand-by force is to be composed of
contingents contributed by all of the OAU member states of a
given region, well-equipped and fully trained to the same
standard.
</P>
<P>
The OAU has advocated that African countries say "no" to
outside interference and rely on themselves to solve their own
problems.
</P>
<P>
African countries are confident of their ability. As Salim
once said that African countries can be self-reliant in meeting
the challenges of peace and development, as they had been in
meeting the challenges of independence.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong province
invested 2.354 billion yuan in the first three months this year,
for technical transformation in the industrial and communications
sectors, up 17.1 percent over the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
According to the local source, the widespread introduction of
advanced technologies and equipment from abroad has played a major
role in the province's economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
However, the province's investment on technical transformation
dropped lower than the nation's average over the past five years,
which has affected its economic growth to some extent.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government calls for greater efforts on the
technical transformation with priority given to the structural
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose, the province has earmarked 100 million yuan
this year as special fund for technical transformation, which is
expected to increase on a year-on-year basis.

<P>
LAGOS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. warship with a complement of
1,200 marines berthed in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone on
Wednesday and is reportedly as back-up for west African
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said troops of the peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG were being air-lifted into Freetown from neighboring
Liberia in a move believed to aim at flushing out the military
leaders that toppled the elected government of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah in a coup last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, two boatloads of some 700
heavily armed ECOMOG troops have already arrived in Freetown for
an unannounced mission.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. state department spokesman was quoted as saying the
American warship and the marines would cooperate with ECOMOG in
seeing that peace prevailed in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, the force will not intervene in Sierra Leonean
affairs and was only to evacuate some nationals, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The coupists in Sierra Leone, who have suffered increasing
isolation, got the only support from the country's rebel leader
Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who has stayed in detention in Nigeria since mid-March
this year, was reported to urge his fighters of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) to work with the country's new military
regime. He said he would go back to Sierra Leone for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
according to agency reports, Freetown was relatively calm on
Wendesay for the first time since Sunday, but shops, banks and
offices remained closed.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders have banned all demonstrations, public
meetings and processions in the west African country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Supports Continuation of Intra-Afghan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan fully supports the
continuation of the intra-Afghan peace process, a spokesman from
the Foreign Ministry said today at a weekly news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "Pakistan's recognition of the Taliban
government is based on objective realities. Other countries have
also taken a similar decision."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan announced on May 25
that his government has decided to "accord formal recognition to
the new government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan" led by the
Islamic Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the Taliban militia retreated on
Wednesday from Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of defeated Uzbek
warlord Rashid Dostum, after hours of heavy fighting with forces
loyal to General Abdul Malik, whose defection to Taliban last week
triggered Dostum's downfall.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that according to reports available,
negotiations are currently underway in Afghanistan to remove
differences among various groups.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that high-ranking Taliban officials including
ave been arrested when
rival forces seized northern Mazar-e-Sharif after bitter fighting.
</P>
<P>
They are among thousands of people taken prisoners as the
Taliban militia retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif, four days after
entering the ancient northern Afghan city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said that the Pakistani government has
"no information" about the capture of the Taliban foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
The new situation in Mazar-e-Sharif will not affect Pakistan's
policy towards Afghanistan that is "strict non-interference in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, a high-altitude Indian
aircraft violated Pakistan's airspace a day earlier. The aircraft
was apparently on a photographic mission, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman from the Indian Defense Ministry denied
the reports, saying that no Indian Air Force plane had intruded
into the Pakistani airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign affairs spokesman said that his
government had lodged a protect with the Indian government at the
issue, and was waiting for the Indian response.
</P>
<P>
The incident would not affect the foreign secretary-level talks
between Pakistan and India which is scheduled on June 19-22 in
Islamabad, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Victor
Pasouvaluk would make a one-day visit to Pakistan on June 7, and
Pakistani Foreign Minister Ayub Khan would visit Russia on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Feud Delays Approval of Israel's Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry has
delayed approval of several high-level diplomatic appointments
due to its feud with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, The
Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Appointments Committee, which was supposed to
meet Wednesday to consider the appointments made last week by
Netanyahu, canceled the meeting at the request of the
ministry's union, said the report.
</P>
<P>
These high-level appointments included Netanyahu's political
adviser Dore Gold as ambassador to the United Nations, Leonard
Davis, former head of Israeli lobby in the United States, as No. 2
figure in the embassy to the United States, and National
Infrastructure Ministry spokesman Raanan Gissin as Washington
embassy press attache.
</P>
<P>
A source from the ministry was quoted as saying that the
numerous political appointments of non-professional outsiders
were causing "total demoralization" in the ministry and cutting
off the ministry's professional staff from the senior diplomatic
work.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's union recently sent a letter to Foreign
Minister David Levy telling him that the latest political
appointments were taking relations with the United States out of
the ministry's hands.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the letter said, these appointments would render
the ministry a marginal, irrelevant appendage of the apparatus
determining Israel's foreign relations, whose senior staff would
be good only for administrative work, such as issuing passports.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already complained about what it called
political appointments made in the past, including ambassadors to
Britain, South Africa, China and Russia, which were all taken from
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Levy, head of the Appointments Committee, now agreed to wait
until the union formulates its position.
</P>
<P>
But further delay to appoint the ambassador to the United
Nations is expected to cause more public furor over the
government's inability to function.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. post, one of the most important diplomatic
appointments, has been vacated for one year since the Netanyahu
government came to power, mainly due to the feud between the Prime
Minister's Office and the foreign ministry over the right of
appointment.

<HEADLINE> Forest, Grassland Fires Put Out in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Up till Wednesday, all the
forest and grassland fires in Mongolia had been put out.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, Dorjdagva, a senior official
of the Mongolian Civil Defense Committee, said that all the fires
had been put out except for 13 hidden ones.
</P>
<P>
The firemen have been watching closely at the forests and
grasslands in the northern province of Chovsgol and central
province of Tov to prevent them from burning again, he added.
</P>
<P>
Up to 158 fires in 11 provinces of Mongolia had occurred since
February 23 this year, most of which were caused by carelessness,
said Dorjdagva.
</P>
<P>
The recent heavy rains were regarded as the main factor for the
putting out of the fires, said the official.
</P>
<P>
More than four million hectares of forest and grassland had been
engulfed by fires and the losses are still being calculated.
</P>
<P>
The 417 forest and grassland fires in spring last year, which
involved 16 provinces in the country and lasted three months,
resulted in nearly two billion U.S. dollars of losses in ecology
and economy.

<HEADLINE> One-Third of Nepali Women Still Denied Contraceptives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- About one third of married women
in Nepal still have no access to modern contraceptive methods
although almost all of them know the concept of family planning, a
United Nations official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 98 percent of married women in Nepal have heard of at
least one method of family planning, but over 31 percent of them
are still denied any contraceptives, according to Carroll Long,
the UN resident representative in Nepal while releasing the 1997
World Population Report at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The contraceptive prevalence rate among Nepalese married women
has increased to 29 percent at present from only 3 percent in
1976, mainly thanks to the joint family planning efforts of the
government and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) in the last 20
years, the official said by citing the findings of a recent
demographic survey in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Nepal Family Health Survey indicated that the
fertility in Nepal has declined steadily from over 6 births per
woman in mid-1970s to 4.6 birth per woman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Population Report released here today,
Nepal's population, currently standing at 22 million with an
annual growth of 2.5 percent, would increase to over 40 million
within the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Nepali family planning officials disclosed at the press
conference that over 90 percent of Nepali women deliver their
children at home without necessary medical assistance from trained
personnel.

JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland has announced a
4.55-million U.S. Dollar project to upgrade its international
airport, Mbabane's Matsapha Airport, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland will spend three years to improve air safety, and to
construct a new terminal building and runway, Swaziland's
Transport and Communications Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
At the completion of the project, Matsapha Airport will be
capable of handling Boeing 747 aircraft, the South African Press
Association quoted the ministry officials as reporting.
</P>
<P>
At present, the dilapidated airport can only land smaller
planes, which, tourism operators insist, is hamstringing their
attempts to broaden the kingdom's tourism industry beyond its two
casinos.
</P>
<P>
Matsapha Airport currently is used by only two airlines, the
domestic carrier Royal Swazi which flies routes to South African
cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town as well as to Zimbabwe and
Kenya. The other carrier is South Afrcia's domestic carrier,
Comair.
</P>
<P>
The airport upgrade construction, which is being funded by a
number of unnamed foreign donors, will begin December 1.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Receives More Tourists from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists from Taiwan
to Xiamen, a port and scenic city in east China's Fujian Province,
rose sharply in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Xiamen City government show that the city
received 32,992 Taiwanese tourists in the first four months of the
year, an increase of 46 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in March, the number of Taiwanese tourists to
Xiamen soared nearly 86 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen-Taiwan business fair held in April was the largest
economic, trade, tourism, and cultural activity between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen has also been designated by the central government as
one of the ports to try out direct shipping service between Taiwan
and China's inland areas. A promising future of convenient
exchanges has boosted people's confidence, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, economic and social progress in Xiamen,
comfortable living and low medical expenses have given many
Taiwan people incentives to frequent Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 when the Taiwan authorities allowed Taiwan people to
visit their relatives in the inland areas, Xiamen has been an
important port for their commuting.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that since 1987, Xiamen City has received 1.72
million Taiwan compatriots, one-sixth of all coming to the
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Xiamen has become a major place to host
economic, cultural, and scientific exchanges with Taiwan. By the
end of last year, 448 such activities had been conducted.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Pay More Attention to Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU), while continuing its traditional work of maintaining peace
and stability on the continent, will pay more attention to
economic issues, OAU officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The growing trend for peace and stability allows the
organization to address the pressing issue of achieving economic
development for the sake of consolidating peace and stability,
said the officials.
</P>
<P>
This view was echoed by participants attending the opening
session of the pre-summit meeting of the OAU Council of Ministers
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
OAU member states have shown far more interest in an
integrated economy following the attainment of political
stability in most African countries, Salim Ahmed Salim said in a
speech at Wednesday's session.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on economic issues comes against a background of
encouraging economic performance by most member countries.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, 32 out of Africa's 53 countries
registered positive economic growth. As a result of these
changes, concerted efforts to draw new investments and sustain
faster economic development will feature prominently on the OAU
summit slated for on June 2-4.

grouping stood a chance to emerge competitive.
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent hope that the assembly will take important
decisions as to the way forward for the building of the African
Economic Community," said Salim. "In addition to being a means
for socio-economic development, the community will buttress the
efforts of our organization generally at peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Participants noted that world economic trends now called for
collective efforts by Africa to move with greater speed and
purposefulness in integrating African economics under the African
Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that first of all African countries should
strengthen their sub-regional groupings which are the building
blocks of a wider pan-African community.

<HEADLINE> Malaria on OAU Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaria will be put on the agenda
of the summit conference of the Organization of African Unity
scheduled from June 2 to 4, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 4,200 people die of malaria every
day in Africa and the disease has become a major concern to the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The director general of the World Health Organization, Hiroshi
Nakajima, is expected to come to Harare for the OAU summit to
push adoption of a declaration on prevention and control of
malaria in the context of African economic recovery and
development.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is killing one million people every year and producing
debilitating illness on about 450 million people in Africa,
according to information from the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the current increase of the malaria problem, as a
result of large-scale population movements due to natural and
man-made disasters, socio-economic factors and drug resistance,
malaria is curable and can be effectively prevented and
controlled with the available technology," a spokeman of the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the disease, there is need for political commitment
by all countries in the continent in terms of policies for
malaria control, making resources available, and mobilization of
communities for active participation in the control of malaria,
said the spokesman.

YINCHUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Grand Western Mosque lies at
the foot of the picturesque Xifeng Mountains. Opposite the street
from this mosque are four mosques of different Islamic
sects. Muslims wearing white caps kneel down on the ground
performing their morning services.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred meters down from the grand mosque is a
construction site to expand a Christian cathedral that sports a
gigantic black crucifix above the roof. Several nuns are cleaning
the street.
</P>
<P>
Monks in twos and threes wearing yellow kasaya robes come from
behind the mountains, where music-like script chanting from
Buddhist monasteries can be heard.
</P>
<P>
This is a daily scene in the downtown area of Lintan County in
Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Northeast China's Gansu
Province, which has 360,000 Tibetans, who are virtually all
Buddhism followers, 178,000 Hans, and 42,000 people of ethnic
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
"The whole prefecture has 175 religious sites for religious
believers of various kinds, and they all live in harmony," said
Dan Zimgua, director of the Prefectural Bureau of Religious
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Professional clergymen live in peace with each other. The
public believes that the different religions help each other
economically.
</P>
<P>
Islamic doctrines teach its followers to pay equal attention to
lives before and after death, while Buddhism focuses on the next
life. That is why Muslims are experts in trade and commerce in
the area where Tibetans are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Tibetans engage in trade and cargo transport
joint-ventures along roadsides. Tibetans willingly provide lands
for Muslims to build houses and mosques.
</P>
<P>
"Mutual help and tolerance are beneficial to all, and we are
like one big family," said Samge, a Tibetan who offered a piece of
his land to an Islamic Hui farmer.
</P>
<P>
When a fire broke out in the Major Script Hall of the Lapuleng
Monastery, one of the important monastery of Tibetan Buddhism in
Gansu, one of the first to come to rescue was a young Muslim.

Even reclusive religious leaders agree that good relations with
other religions have been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"Islamic mosques have done a good job in encouraging their
believers to become prosperous and the mosques could be self
sufficient, we should learn these aspects from them," said Jamyang
Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, 49, a renowned "living buddha"
of the Lapuleng Monastery. Jamyang is an intimate friend of Min
Shengguang, 61, iman of the Grand Western Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Christianity has a history of 105 years in Gannan. Abbot Hou
Daxiao, 77, quoted the "Regulations on Cathedral Management" as he
spoke of making a rule this year "to maintain harmony and unity
among different ethnic groups and religions, and within our own
religion."
</P>
<P>
Bai Yuzhang, deputy commissioner of Gannan Prefecture who is of
Dongxiang ethnic group, also attributed the rapid development of
the local economy and a stable social order to the harmonious ethnic
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Unity has promoted social stability and economic
growth. Last year, our prefecture scored a combined industrial and
agricultural output value of nearly one billion yuan and the
per-capita net income of farmers and herdsmen averaged 700 yuan,
100 yuan more than in 1995."
</P>
<P>
"In a world of religious clashes and ethnic conflict, Gannan
Prefecture and China as a whole still maintain a sound ethnic and
religious order, thanks to the government policy of ethnic
equality and religious freedom," local religious affairs official
Dan Zimgua said.
</P>
<P>
Iman Min Shengguang started a kindergarten and a primary school
at the backyard of the Grand Western Mosque. He himself donated
10,000 yuan to help bring dropouts back to school. There are 460
Tibetan, Han, Hui, Manchu, Tu, Sala, and Dongxiang students in his
kindergarten and school.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Iman Min was commended by the central government as a
"leader for the promotion of ethnic unity" last year. The majority
of the votes for him came from local Tibetans believing in
Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Voting Runs Smoothly in Jakarta, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian voters turned out in
droves today to cast their ballots at polling stations this
morning to elect members of the house of representatives.
</P>
<P>
When polls opened at 8:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) in Jakarta, capital
of Indonesia, voters were lined up under clear skies at many
roadside polling places covered by striped awnings.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station in Menteng district, central Jakarta, the
correspondent witnessed the procedure of vote-casting which was
conducted orderly: voters individually entered the polling booths
and, using a big nail or other sharp object, pierced the symbol of
the party of their choice on two ballot papers in a small tent and
then put them into ballot box.
</P>
<P>
Some people chose the "star" of the United Development Party
(PPP), some others chose the "banyan tree" of the ruling party
Golkar and a few people chose the "buffalo head"' of the
Indonesian Democratic party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The three parties -- PPP, Golkar and PDI -- have submitted a
total of 2,293 candidates for this year's general election. But
voting is for parties, not individuals, with seats distributed on
a proportional basis.
</P>
<P>
Some voters are pessimistic about the election.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just using my right to vote but I don't expect much from
the people I choose," a middle-aged man said.
</P>
<P>
But more are expectant of what the election could bring about.
</P>
<P>
"I choose the Golkar, because Golkar could raise the living
standard of the common people," Mohammad Sjahril, a private
businessman said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we not only need to raise daily living standard, but also
hope that our children could be educated in universities. So, the
country's economy should be developed faster under the leadership
of a strong party," he added.
</P>
<P>
At another polling station, Wakimin, a young man working at a
restaurant, told the correspondent that he hoped the government
could pay more attention to social justice in the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's voting was tightly guarded by troops and policemen who
were deployed around the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sutiyoso said Wednesday
that about 25,000 officers, including 12,000 policemen, would be
deployed to safeguard the election in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, polling teams, with three to seven members each,
were also seen at the voting booths. These teams, assisted by
security officers, oversee polling activities in each location.
Party representatives are also placed at polling stations to
guarantee fair balloting and vote counting.
</P>
<P>
Voting is scheduled to end at 14:00 and preliminary results
were expected at 19:00 on election day. But the final results will
be announced some time in the middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Backs ASEAN Expansion This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has given its backing to
the admission of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar into the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, saying that all
three had fulfilled the technical requirements for membership.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas last night rejected the speculation
there were any criteria which could hamper the entry of the three
nations.
</P>
<P>
"Our (Indonesia's) hope is that they will be accepted as full
members this year. Indonesia believes all the requirements have
been met," Alatas said at the Bina Graha Presidential Office after
reporting to President Soeharto on his plans to attend a special
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Kuala Lumpur was called to determine the timing
of the three prospective member's entry.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have all applied for membership but
the exact timing of their admission remains uncertain. The most
likely dates are either during the annual ASEAN ministerial
meeting in July or the commemorative ASEAN summit in December.
Both events will be held in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
During an informal summit here last year, ASEAN leaders agreed
to admit the three simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Alatas dismissed western demands to delay Myanmar's membership,
arguing that domestic issues do not impinge on consideration for
membership.
</P>
<P>
"We shall hold firm in our view that we will be the ones who
decide the entry of a new member based on the technical criteria
which ASEAN agreed to from the beginning," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprise Groups Thriving in Major Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises are doing a
brisk business in Liaoning Province, a major industrial base in
northeast China, as state-owned firms are trying to invigorate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 big township enterprise groups have sprung up and
now account for over one-tenth of fixed assets and industrial
pre-tax profits of all township-run factories in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, township enterprises generated 97.7 billion yuan in
added value, up 54 percent over 1995 and exported more
than 20 billion yuan worth-of goods.
</P>
<P>
While making up half of Liaoning's industrial economy, township
enterprises have become a major source of revenues for township
budgets, said an official with the Provincial Township Enterprises
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Bureau Director Gao Maoxin said that Liaoning plans to increase
the number of large township enterprise groups to 500 in the next
few years and enable them to become a driving force behind local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most rural enterprise groups in Liaoning province
are involved in such industries as machinery, building materials
and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to assist rural
enterprise turning out digit-controlled machine tools, food
processing machinery and packaging materials.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Pushing for Cleaner Manufacturing Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has had some
success in pushing for cleaner manufacturing methods and has
reduced the discharge of waste water by 1.84 million tons over the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was listed as a pilot city for cleaner production
methods in 1992, and in the last two years has applied these
methods to 39 factories and 50 workshops in the chemical industry,
paper-making industry, in engineering, and in other industries.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing No. Three Chemical Factory used to be the city's
third largest polluter. So, it devised a plan, whereby it would
spend eight million yuan (about a million US dollars) on a sewage
treatment plant whose annual operating cost was expected to be
600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
It launched 20 cleaner manufacturing projects in 1993, spending
only 4.32 million yuan, and reduced water pollutants by 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
With 10 more projects of this kind in 1994 it was able to cut
down not only on resources used, but also on costs by more than a
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Resolve Black Sea Fleet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Ukraine today resolved
their dispute over dividing the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet,
signing three agreements to give Russia rights to use Ukraine's
naval base at Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
The deals were signed by Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko and his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin and
set terms for basing Russian ships in Ukraine, the division of the
fleet and what Moscow will pay Kiev in rent for using the bases.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is aimed at solving what has been one of the
biggest stumbling blocks in relations between the two former
Soviet Republics since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The issue has repeatedly delayed the signing of a milestone
Russian-Ukrainian friendship treaty. But after today's agreement,
both sides agreed that the treaty was likely to be signed this
weekend when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visits Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Both Lazarenko and Chernomyrdin spoke highly of the agreements
as an "historic event" in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the accords are in the interests of the
people of the two countries and Russia will maintain truly
friendly, brotherly and equal relations with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister, who arrived here for a one-day
visit Wednesday, added that the accords paved the way for
Yeltsin's visit Friday.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Reaffirms Cooperation on Macao Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
said today that his country will do its best to cooperate with
China in ensuring a smooth transition of Macao to China.
</P>
<P>
He made the reaffirmation to the visiting Chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan,
during their talks.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said it is important for both Portugal and China to
properly resolve the Macao issue left over by history. Portugal
would do its best to cooperate closely with China to ensure a
smooth transition of Macao to China and continue to maintain
prosperity and stability in Macao, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said both countries have cooperated fruitfully since they
signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is returning to China in just two-and-a-half years and
much work remains to be done. It is necessary for China and
Portugal to increase mutual trust and strengthen cooperation and
speed up the work (related to the return of Macao)," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong is returning to China in a month and the
situation there is very good. "We can be sure that the transfer of
government in Hong Kong will be achieved smoothly and Hong Kong
will definitely maintain its stability and prosperity for a long
time."
</P>
<P>
"Drawing on the experience of Kong Kong's return to China, and
with the sincere cooperation between China and Portugal, We have
reasons to believe that the Macao issue will be solved more
satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that through the smooth settlement of the Macao
issue, Portugal and China will set an example for other countries
to resolve similar questions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the policy of "one country, two systems" for the
peaceful reunification of China is a great invention made by Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The interests of the Chinese people in the mainland, the people
of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and the parties concerned in the
rest of the world were taken into consideration in the formulation
of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said: "We greatly appreciate the conception of 'one
country, two systems' created by Deng Xiaoping. Under the guidance
of the great conception, not only the peoples of Portugal and
China are fully confident about the future of Macao, but also the
Portuguese-Sino relations will be further promoted and fully
developed."
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Portugal should fully take the opportunity of
resolving the Macao issue to enhance mutual understanding, remove
misunderstandings and find more meeting points of interest for the
development of Sino-Portuguese ties and expansion of exchanges and
cooperation in all fields.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Agrees to Receive Returnees From Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has reiterated its agreement
to receive over 1,000 Vietnamese boat people back from Hong Kong
before the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said it had asked for help
from the British-Hong Kong Authorities and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to send back the refugees.
</P>
<P>
As agreed upon with Vietnam, some the boat people were to fly
home between May 28 and 30, and the 18 of them now under medical
treatment and their relatives were allowed to return later.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Vietnam's position on the repatriation of
boat people from Hong Kong at the final stage of the Comprehensive

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Countries Move to Protect Forest Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, one-third of the
total land area in the Philippines was covered by green forests.
The country was rich in thousands of kinds of tropical plants,
especially bamboo, and was called "the Kingdom of Bamboo".
</P>
<P>
But such is not the case any more. Furthermore, the forest
crisis in the country is getting worse and fast approaching
disaster status. Serious deforestation in the past two decades had
turned the country from a top timber exporter to a top importer.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the Filipinos are losing
100,000 hectares of forest land every year. As a result, it now
has only 6.2 million hectares of forests, or 19 percent of the
total land area of the country.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Philippines is 23 times worse than those
of other Asian-Pacific countries, 13 times worse than African
countries and eight times worse than the whole tropical world,
said a forestry professor at the University of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Philippines is not the sole country suffering this
crisis. Deforestation in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Mongolia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other Asian-Pacific
nations are also reportedly becoming very serious.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization,
the Philippines and other Asian countries are cutting 3.9 million
hectares of forests every year, or 34.5 percent of the world's
total forest losses in a year.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the world's forest area, including
natural forests and plantations, was currently at about 3.5
billion hectares, of which only 16 percent scattered in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Studies showed that Asia's burgeoning population, which is
growing by 1.6 percent a year, is the primary cause of the
widespread forest degradation in the region. For survival, more
people in poor areas are cutting or selling forests as firewood or
converting more forest land for agricultural uses.
</P>
<P>
Fire is another constant threat to forests. Australia,
Indonesia and Thailand were all seared by major forest fires in
the past decade while more than three million hectares of forests
went up in smoke in Mongolia last year.
</P>
<P>
Other threats to forests include pests, diseases and
environmental degradation such as air pollution. The deforestation
caused by these factors not only adversely affected the
development of agriculture by eroding topsoil, but also put many
species on the verge of extinction, like eagle, Tamarau, deer and
tarsier in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
To stop the wanton forest destruction, most Asian countries
have been taking measures to protect their diminishing forests.
</P>
<P>
Many countries including Bangladesh, China, the Philippines and
Thailand have signed various initiatives to conserve forests. New
Zealand, Sri Lanka and Thailand have restricted most timber
harvesting in natural forests.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Bhutan, Cambodia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and
Thailand have designated more than 10 percent of their total land
as protected areas, while the reforestation programs in China,
India, Indonesia and Vietnam have been noteworthy for their scale.
Pakistan is also set to re-green with the Asian Development Bank
aid.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, for its part, is seeking to educate people on
the value of forests, mete out serious punishment to illegal
loggers and launch a billion-tree reforestation program across the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, most Asian countries still have a lot to do in
protecting their forests. Studies showed that only China,
Indonesia and Malaysia are judged to have a reasonable prospect of
bringing their forests under sustainable management by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> 16,000 Planes Needed in Next 2 Decades: Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Airbus Industrie, the world's
aircraft giant, has foreseen a world demand for nearly 16,000
planes to satisfy traffic growth and replace aging aircraft over
the next 20 years, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest Airbus global forecast covers the demand for
deliveries of passenger and aircraft with more than 70 seats to
the world's 246 largest airlines during the period from the end of
1996 until the end of 2016, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With some 2,500 of the needed aircraft already ordered by
airlines and leasing companies, the actual open market for
additional sales is some 13,500 units worth approximately 1.1
trillion U.S. dollars at current value.
</P>
<P>
Of these units, some 15 percent or about 2,000 aircraft may be
taken up by used aircraft, leaving an open market for new aircraft
sales of some 11,500 airliners.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie's senior Vice President for Commercial John
Leahy was quoted as saying this new forecast "confirms that there
is a very large demand for capacity and new equipment."
</P>
<P>
The forecast stated that worldwide demand for air travel will
continue to grow strongly, at an average rate of 5.2 percent, with
passenger traffic being nearly three times as high in 20 years
time as it is today.
</P>
<P>
The growth will be stronger in the first 10-year period,
increasing annually at an average rate of 5.9 percent, while the
second 10-year period should register a 4.6 percent year-on-year
progression.
</P>
<P>
The active fleet will rise to 17,000 aircraft from today's
9,400. This will accommodate most of the predicted traffic growth,
with higher aircraft productivity and load factors being the other
factor.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 of the current fleets will need to be replaced,
essentially because of the constantly increasing maintenance and
operating costs and the reduced productivity of aging aircraft.

<HEADLINE> China Protecting Manchurian Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China has developed ways to protect
the Manchurian tiger with a forest protection zone and the world's
largest breeding base.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the base has succeeded in breeding 83 tiger cubs.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinchen, director of the China Breeding Center For Cat
Family Animals, told reporters that the number of wild Manchurian
tigers in the world is now only about 300, and the number
remaining in China is less than 30.
</P>
<P>
The World Wildlife Fund has listed the tiger as one of the
world's ten most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
China is the home of the tiger and is emphasizing protection by
placing the animal under category-one protection. It spent more
than 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) in 1986 on the
breeding base in Hengdaohezhi, near the Greater Hinggan Mountains in
the northeast, in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The base has studied breeding difficulties, and protecting the
tiger against diseases, and has the largest artificial-breeding
center for Manchurian tigers in the world.
</P>
<P>
China also built a base in the northern suburbs of Harbin, the
capital of Heilongjiang Province to help prepare tigers for return
to nature.
</P>
<P>
The first group of 30 tigers has been selected, to train them
how to hunt other animals and adapt to a harsh environment, and
they are expected to form a group through natural breeding.

Jakarta, the country's capital, is almost empty of traffic as
many people stayed away from work in the morning to vote.
</P>
<P>
A total of 305,219 polling stations have been set up throughout
the scattered islands of the tropical archipelago for 124,740,987
eligible voters, including 20 million young people who will be
casting ballots for the first time, to choose 425 members for the
500-seat House of Representatives for the 1998-2003 term of
office.
</P>
<P>
The election will decide who will occupy seats in the House of
Representatives, provincial legislative councils and regency or
mayoralty councils. Each of the members elected will represent
400,000 people of the Indonesian nation.
</P>
<P>
The 500 House members, together with 500 regional
representatives and community figures, will form the People's
Consultative Assembly, which will elect the country's president
and vice-president in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian election system does not advocate direct
election. Voters do not choose candidates but choose the symbols
of the political organizations contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
Three parties are allowed to take part in the election. They
are the ruling group Golkar, which, backed by civil servants and
the powerful armed forces, has won each of the five general
elections since 1971; the United Development Party (PPP) formed by
four Muslim parties; and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
which is an alliance of nationalist and Christian forces.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have put forward their platforms for the next
five years during their campaigns from April 27 to may 23.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar is aiming to win 70.02 percent of the vote for the
House this year while the PPP is hoping for a significant increase
over the 17 percent it won in 1992 and the PDI said it would be
happy if it picks up its rivals' leftovers.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar currently holds 282 seats in the House of
Representatives while the PPP has 62 and the PDI 56.
</P>
<P>
General elections are held every five years in the country. The
government sees the voter turnout as a crucial indicator of public
endorsement of the nation's political system. The voter turnout in
Indonesia was usually more than 90 percent in the past general
elections.
</P>
<P>
However, some political observers said this year's voter
turnout is possibly lower than expected because many young people,
especially supporters of the ousted PDI chairman, Megawati
Soekarnoputri, have claimed that they would boycott the voting.
Megawati declared non-voting last week, saying the May 29 election
would be "unconstitutional" because her party is represented by
Soerjadi who deposed her in an illegal rebel congress last year.
</P>
<P>
Legislative members of the provincial and regional/municipal
levels will elected in elections held simultaneously across the
country today.
</P>
<P>
The voting is expected to close at 2:00 p.m. and the National
Election Institute will start announcing partial results from 7:00
tonight. The final results however will not come out until some
time in the middle of next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Economic cooperation between Hong
Kong and south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been
growing steadily, with the former becoming the ethnic minority
region's largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that between 1991 and 1995, goods supplied by
Guangxi to Hong Kong topped 3.4 billion US dollars, amounting to
half of the region's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The variety of the commodities supplied by Guangxi to Hong Kong
has surged from more than 100 in the early 1950s to the 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Many influential companies and consortiums from Hong Kong have
set up joint ventures and solely-funded enterprises in Guangxi,
boosting the autonomous regions' drive to open to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi enjoys a favorable geological location and rich natural
resource, and is trying to turn itself into an export outlet for
the entire southwest regions of the country.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 29 (Xinhua) -- No one looking at the graceful
girl with her white skirt and smooth skin, on the store shelf in
Shanghai would think she was made of river silt, unless he or she
read the card that accompanies it.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of pottery figurines using river silt has
turned out to be another way of using riverbed silt of the Suzhou
River, one of the major rivers running Shanghai, China's largest
commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River is also the most seriously-polluted river in
Shanghai. But a pollution treatment project has begun and an
important part of the project is to make china from the silt which
contains organic materials and heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xipei, an engineer with the city's Suzhou River management
office, says that 40 percent of the pottery is silt.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Science and Technology Commission is doing
research on how to produce new building materials from the silt.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou River is expected to become a tourist spot by the
year 2000.

WARSAW, May 28, (Xinhua) -- Poland and the Czech Republic are

</P>
<P>
The move was agreed during talks between the two countries'
foreign and defense ministers today in the city of Wraclaw, in

</P>
<P>
During the talks, a military flight cooperation agreement was
signed by Polish Defense Minister Stanislaw Dobrzanski and his
Czech counterpart Miloslav Vyborny. The deal involves cooperation
to protect flight safety and exchange flight information.

<HEADLINE> Climate Change Gives Australia Bumper Wheat Yield: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Climate change was responsible for
up to half of the impressive increase in Australia's wheat crop
since the 1950s, according to a leading climatologist who was
"surprised" by the magnitude of the impact.
</P>
<P>
Previously, experts believed that most of the gain came from
"non-climate" factors, such as better strains of wheat and
improved farm management techniques.
</P>
<P>
The average yield of wheat, the nation's most economically
important crop, has increased since 1952 by about 45 percent, or
0.5 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Neville Nicholls, of the Bureau of Meteorology Research
Center in Melbourne, said that between 30 and 50 percent of the
increase came from a rise in the minimum daily temperature and a
reduction in the number of frosty days.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chris Mitchell, coordinator of a climate variability and
impacts program, said the study, reported today in the journal
Nature, highlights the financial consequences of climate change.
</P>
<P>
"There are these effects and we, as a nation, need to come to
grips with them if we want to improve our economic performance,"
he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1952 and 1992, minimum daily temperatures increased by
1.02 degrees Celsius, while daily maximums increased by 0.58
degrees. The average rainfall increased by 39 mm.
</P>
<P>
Michael Shean, chief crop forecaster with the Australian Wheat
Board in Melbourne, was as surprised by the finding as was Dr.
Nicholls.
</P>
<P>
"I would have informally attributed to larger percentage of the
(increase) to better management and possibly the improvement in
rainfall conditions," he said, adding that Dr. Nicholls had
"partially debunked that idea".
</P>
<P>
Although Dr. Nicholls agreed with Dr. Mitchell that his
methodology was based on historical trends which may not continue
indefinitely into the future, he claimed it could be applied to
other crops worldwide, as well as to non-agricultural matters
affected by climate, such as the incidence of malaria.

XINING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
has begun a large-scale forage grass project to improve its
ecology by planting hardy forage grass in arid eastern mountainous
areas, cold pastoral areas at high altitudes and areas around
Qinghai Lake and Qaidam Basin in its western part.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is on the northeast part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
and has poor weather conditions for planting trees, which is quite
difficult because of the altitude.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by the year 2000, each farmer is to
plant 20 to 50 square meters of perennial forage grass each year
and each herdsman 6,000 square meters of forage grass.
</P>
<P>
The local government will give subsidies to farmers and
herdsmen to purchase grass seeds.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian police authorities
today announced the detention here of 46 adolescents on robbery,
drug trafficking and other charges.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrests, said National Police Director Jose Luis
Sosa, were made Tuesday night after two taxi drivers were murdered
and blame was placed on juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said that of those taken into custody in
roundups carried out in the capital area against gangs of juvenile
delinquents, nine were proven to have committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
As a new measure to fight against crimes, the police would
connect taxi radios to police frequencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he expected the Legislative Assembly to amend the
penal code to allow adolescents who commit felonies such as
robbery, homicide, rape and drug trafficking to be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile gangs in Panama acquired notoriety in 1984 with the
birth of the "Rain Clan," which specialized in committing crimes
during rain storms. Its members were aged from 10 to 17.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities have confirmed the existence of more than 35
gangs of juvenile criminals, which were responsible for some of
the homicides and armed robberies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Different gangs distinguish themselves from each other through
exotic tattoos on their members' shoulders, backs and other body
parts as well as specific dress codes.
</P>
<P>
The trespassing of several gangs onto the territory of others
had sparked turf wars between them.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben
Ali is urging the lifting of all embargoes against Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali, who arrived in Rome earlier today for a two-day state
visit, made the appeal at a state dinner provided by Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali stressed the need to "move actively to end the
(years-long) sufferings of the Libyan and Iraqi peoples resulting
from the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions, first imposed in 1992 and stepped up a
year later by the West against Libya for terrorism, include an air
embargo, a ban on the sale or transfer of weapons and the
downgrading of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against Iraq were imposed after it invaded Kuwait in
1990, and partly lifted last year under a United Nations' "oil for
food" program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the Middle East, Ben Ali condemned Israel for
building a Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem. He said the
"intransigence of Israel and the pursuit of its settlement policy"
was responsible for blocking progress on Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
He praised the approach of the European Union, particularly
that of Italy, to the problem."

</P>
<P>
This is the second of a series of CD-ROMs produced by the

emphasis on those dealing with foreign investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Documents issued by government departments to direct foreign
investment in China are also included.
</P>
<P>
Also, the disk offers updated statistics on China's imports and
exports of machinery and electronics and introduces major Chinese
enterprises and their products.
</P>
<P>
It is reported CCCME is planning another CD-ROM this fall,
aimed at introducing China's high-quality machinery and
electronics products and enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Cleaning up Huaihe River And Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- According to the State Council's
Fourth Working Conference on Treating the Huaihe River and Taihu
Lake recently, 19 projects under way in the Huaihe and 10 in Taihu
will need 30.5 billion (3.7 billion US dollars) yuan from the
central government and local governments over the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects are expected to be completed by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year China established a water conservation fund
for long rivers and the central government this year will add a
billion yuan for water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
A State Planning Commission official says provinces and cities
that do not provide necessary funds for the Huaihe and Taihu
pollution treatment projects can not start other big projects that
use local money.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe runs through the provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui
and Shandong. The Huaihe Valley is one of China's most important
grain production bases with 13 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Taihu Valley is in one of China's most developed areas. It's
GDP accounts for an eighth of the nation's total.

<HEADLINE> Andean Community Sets Guidelines for Entering Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan, Colombian and
Ecuadorean businessmen have established basic guidelines to be
followed by the Andean Community for its admission to the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the two subregional blocs will begin
June 5 in Montevideo, Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day meeting which concluded on Tuesday, Andean
businessmen reaffirmed their support for moving on with the
negotiations with the Mercosur as well as with the Caribbean,
Central America and the Latin American Integration Association
(ALADI).
</P>
<P>
The Andean Group is composed of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and
Venezuela while the Mercosur comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary conclusions by the businessmen are that even though
there are weaknesses, all the sectors have good prospects for
succeeding in the integration.
</P>
<P>
Andean businessmen believe that for the removal of tariffs
between the two blocs, a 10-year period for "non sensitive"
products is prudent and, from there, 15, 18 and 20-year periods
for more sensitive products.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia did not attend the meeting since it has been
negotiating an agreement on an individual basis with Mercosur for
the past year, but its negotiation strategy does not differ from
the one that its Andean Group partners will adopt.

<HEADLINE> Asians, Africans Hit Hardest in Migration Cutbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of new settlers from
Asia, Africa and the Middle East in Australia has slumped 20
percent in the nine months to March, more than twice the fall in
migration from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Statistic figures released yesterday show that the
number of settlers arriving between July and March declined by
11,380, or 15 percent from a year earlier, the Melbourne-based
newspaper The Age reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said three quarters of that cut was in migrants from
Asia, the Middle East and Africa and one-quarter from areas
dominated by whites.
</P>
<P>
Settler arrivals from Asia, the Middle East and Africa went
down by 20 percent, from 42,480 to 34,040. Yet those from Europe,
the Americas and Oceania (mainly New Zealand) fell 8 percent, from
35,810 to 32,890.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show a startling decline in the growth of
Asian tourism to Australia. From an average growth of 18 percent a
year throughout the 1990s, the number of Asian tourists in
Australia has grown just 6 percent since June and 3 percent in the
March quarter.
</P>
<P>
"If sustained, this would be a serious blow to the economy, as
tourism is now Australia's largest export industry, and became so
because the number of Asian tourists trebled to 2.1 million in
seven years," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Spending by overseas tourists and students rose to 11.7 billion
Australian dollars (8.96 billion U.S. dollars) last year, up 6
billion Australian dollars (4.6 billion U.S. dollars) in five
years.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the steeper fall in
Asian immigrants reflected shifts between different categories of
migrants, not a deliberate policy.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced earlier this month the government's
decision to cut immigration intake for 1997-1998 by 6000, a drop
of 20 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard admitted last week that he believed
as early as 1991 that there is a link between certain levels of
immigration and high unemployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Volkswagen company
confirmed today it was planning a series of new investments in
Argentina to increase its car production there.
</P>
<P>
A Volkswagen communique said the company plans to build, with
new investments, a plant to produce transmissions.
</P>
<P>
The decision was part of the company's integral plan to export
cars outside the Southern Common Market (Mercosur).

generation of Volkswagen beetles to be assembled in Mexico during
an initial phase and later in other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> No End in Sight to Four-Week Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 striking workers at
the Panama Cement Company entered the fourth week of their protest
today with no end in sight to the dispute over pay and working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Although the Labor Ministry intervened on Monday to restart
negotiations between the company and the union and to promote a
compromise, no progress was made in the talks.
</P>
<P>
There are still nine main sticking points between the two
sides, although 82 of the 91 clauses in a document present to the
company have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Company and union representatives met Tuesday but were unable
to make any progress.
</P>
<P>
Federico Lee, the company's labor lawyer accused the union of
refusing to discuss the economic clauses in the document and said
the workers, who have been without pay since May 6, are being
needlessly sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
A Labor Ministry official estimated that the strike has cost
the company 2 million U.S. dollars and workers have not been able
to collect nine dollars a day in wages due to "the inflexibility
of the union".

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Benefiting From Japanese Aid Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese relief project has
helped improve the agricultural production conditions and provide
adequate food and clothing for poor farmers in northwest China's
Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, aimed at increasing grain production, has added a
total of 170 million kg of grain output or more than 400 kg per
capita, and 650 million yuan in profits or 1,520 yuan per capita,
over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1989, the project covered 20,000 ha of barren land
in 28 townships. Japan has financed 232 million yen worth of
chemical fertilizers, plastic sheeting, pesticides, tractors, and
farm-use vehicles and parts, according to the provincial
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
As part of the work, an area of 43,200 ha was planted with
grain last year, producing 150 million kg, or 3,645 kg per ha, a
big increase over the pre-project total.
</P>
<P>
The counties concerned built or improved more than 200 water
conservation projects to increase around 3,000 ha of irrigated
farmland. Linxia County was able to provide drinking water for
100,000 people and 60,000 head of livestock by expanding the
Beiyuan canal.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese also sent experts to train farmers on tractor
driving and maintenance. Now, 80 percent of the farmland
cultivation is done by machines.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's Hubei
Province is exceeding other inland cities in its use of foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan City government had approved 5,000 foreign-funded
projects by the end of March, involving 7.1 billion US dollars in
overseas investment from 50 countries and regions. The actual
amount of funds used totalled 4.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, investment from Europe, the
United States and Japan made up 81 percent of total overseas
investment in Wuhan, said Sun Huaiyu, director of the city's
Foreign Investment Office.
</P>
<P>
The city has played host to over 1,000 groups of foreign
businessmen, 70 percent of whom came from Europe, the US, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 of the world's top 500 companies have sent
representatives to Wuhan to look things over. Thirty companies,
including the US's GE and GM, Japan's Sony and Sumitomo, Siemens
of Germany, Citroen of France, and Pilkington of Britain have
built joint ventures or opened representative offices there.
</P>
<P>
The steady inflow of overseas investment has given Wuhan
double-digit economic growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At present 35 percent of fixed assets in Wuhan involve overseas
investment and the ratio in economic and technological development
zones is 60 percent, Sun says.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Price Poised to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wool prices are
poised to surge past the 700 Australian cent (536 U.S. cent) mark
today for the first time in almost two years, the national
newspaper The Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Market Indicator rose 9 Australian cents (6.89 U.S.
cents) to 696 Australian cents (533 U.S. cents) a kilogram at
auctions in Melbourne and Sydney yesterday, the best price since
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The price boom adds to other recent good news for Australia's
wool growers: China, Australia's largest wool market, indicated
this week that it will increase its demand and the federal
government yesterday took moves to give growers a 80 million
Australian dollar (61.6 million U.S. dollar) cash bonus by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Wool prices have jumped 21 Australian cents (16 U.S. cents) in
the past two days in response to a combination of strong demand
from Japan, China and other buyers and relatively small amounts of
wool supplies put up for auction, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts are expecting similar influences today to push
the price above 700 Australian cents, with further increases over
the next month.
</P>
<P>
But they expect the price hike to peter out as the main demand
driving force, the stock building by overseas processors, is
completed.
</P>
<P>
Bill Watkins, an economist at Wool International said he would
be "surprised" if the wool price didn't go through 700 Australian
cents today.
</P>
<P>
But he said the current upward "squeeze" on prices caused by
the limited end-of-season wool supply and stock rebuilding by
processors might only last for another few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters also predicted the
recent price surge would soon peak.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's southern-most
province, has decided to invest 3.43 billion yuan this year in
undertaking 17 key projects, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 17 projects involve construction of infrastructure
facilities, including an airport, a railway, an expressway, a
long-distance telecommunications hub and a sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
The other projects involve a gas-fueled fertilizer plant,
a cement mill, a tin-plating plant, and an oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government noted that the province was founded
in 1988 on a weak economic foundation and with backward industrial
and infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The economic prosperity of the province over the past few years
concentrated on the service sector including trade, tourism, real
estate, and finance.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the hidden crisis behind the superficial prosperity,
the provincial government decided to take effective measures to
divert funds from real estate and other service industries to
infrastructure facilities and the basic industries.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, the province invested cumulatively 92.1
billion yuan in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has built an advanced highway network,
opened 50 air routes, and completed eight ports with a combined
annual handling capacity of over 10 million tons. And the installed
telephone capacity has increased by tenfold since the founding of
the province.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese who wear
contact lens has reached more than three million and has been
increasing by 30-40 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 2,500 optometrists in China who test
eyesight for contact lens, a recent national survey shows.
</P>
<P>
To improve the professional skills of the optometrists in
China, the American Bausch and Lomb Company and a cornea and
contact lens research institute in Sidney, Australia, opened a
five-day training course in early May in Shenyang, the capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 optometrists from the city, other cities in
northeast China and from northern parts of China received 40
hours' training in physiological anatomy, optometry for contact
lens, basic procedures of eyesight test and the complications
related to wearing contact lens.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that more than half of the people in the
world need some form of eyesight correction.

<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 28 (Xinhua) -- World number one Dong
Jiong of China fought off ailment and fever to advance into the
third round of the world badminton championships here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fever would probably wipe out his hope to win his first
world title, his coach Li Mao said. Dong's strongest rival
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen said it was bad news.
</P>
<P>
Dong, All-England Open winner and a hot favorite for the men's
singles title, was not feeling well since last night, Li told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With his body temperature running as high as 39.8 degrees
Centigrade Wednesday morning, Dong had to battle for 40 minutes
to gain a 15-11, 15-5 second-round victory over Pavel Uvarov of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The fever would "greatly affects his performance" in
Thursday's third-round clash against tenth-seeded Denmark's
Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It is bad news," said Olympic champion Hoyer-Larsen. "It is
bad for the championships because Dong is one of the best players
here."
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen had to overcome a 6-0 deficit in the first game
to beat Malaysia's Wong Choon Han 18-16 and 15-11 to meet
14th-seeded Chinese Luo Yigang, who defeated Portugal's Fernando
Silva 15-3, 9-15, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen tied the first game at 11-all and 13-all before
winning the five-point setting 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Tenth seed Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of Denmark had a tough time
in the first time before winning 18-16, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians all breezed into the last 16 with straight-set
victories, including defending champion Heryanto Arbi,
fourth-seeded Indra Wijaya, 13th-seeded Allan Budi Kusuma, fifth
seed Joko Surpianto and ninth seed Budi Santoso.
</P>
<P>
In the third round, Santoso will meet All England runner-up
Sun Jun of China, while Surpianto faces Han.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Japan Open winner Peter Rasmussen of Denmark,
Malaysia's Ong Ewe Hock, and South Korea's Park Sung Woo also
breezed through with straight-set wins.
</P>
<P>
In women's singles, all eight Chinese women went through the
second round.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ye Zhaoying of China disposed of
Australia's Lisa Campbell 11-1, 11-1 in 11 minutes to face
Indonesia's Cindana in the next round.
</P>
<P>
The other Chinese in the next round are world number two Gong
Zhichao, Dai Yun, Yao Yan, Wang Chen, Zeng Yaqiong, Han Jingna
and Zhang Ning.
</P>
<P>
The only seed that dropped out was 16th-seeded Indonesian
Meiluawai, who was sent packing by Huang Chia-chi of Chinese
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
In mixed doubles, All England champions Liu Yong and Ge Fei
sailed into the quater-finals by defeating Simon Archer and Julie
Bradbury 15-8, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
They will face South Koreans Lee Dong Soo and Yim Kyung Jin,
the 15th seeds who downed Denmark's Thomas Stvngaard and Ann
Jorgensen in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
South Korean qualifers Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min upset
16th seed Chen Xingdong and Gu Jun 15-7, 15-4, setting a
quarter-final clash against top seeds Trikus Heryanto and Minarti
Timur of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Third seeded Danish duo of Jens Eriksen and Thomsen will meet
Axelsson and Bengtsson of Sweden, while world number two Michael
Sogaard and Rikke Olsen, also from Denmark, will face Indonesia's
Imam Tohari and Ema Ermawati.

doubles, losing to Erica van Den Heuvel and Monique Hoogland of
the Netherlands.

<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Borussia Dortmund pulled off the
biggest upset in the European Cup final for more than a decade
when they beat defending champion Juventus 3-1 in Munich on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two goals by Karlheinz Reidle and a third in the 71st minute
from substitute Lars Ricken, who had been on the pitch for only
16 seconds, secured the German club's victory.
</P>
<P>
The newly-crowned Italian Serie A champion Juventus hit its
sole goal through substitute Alessandro Del Piero after 64
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund opened the scoring in the 29th minute as Riedle
blasted home with the left foot. He made it 2-0 when he headed
home a corner five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Ricken scored a superb goal, lofting the ball high over
Peruzzi's head from 30 meters after spotting the goalkeeper off
his line.
</P>
<P>
The result was the biggest upset since Steaua Bucharest beat
Barcelona in the 1986 final.
</P>
<P>
Borussia became the first German team to win the European Cup
since Hamburg in 1983, who coincidentally also beat Juventus in
that final.

<HEADLINE> Women Become Leading Force in Poverty Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Accounting for half of China's 58
million poverty-stricken population, women have become a leading
force in the drive to eliminate poverty in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Women's participation in poverty elimination work is
indispensable for the attainment of China's goal of eradicating
absolute poverty by the year 2000, according to an official with
the All China Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a work conference held here recently, the official
said that for the past eight years, the ACWF has sponsored an
educational program which encourages women to contribute to local
economic development, and has benefited tens of millions women
across the country.
</P>
<P>
It launched another campaign last year called "Women to Help
the Poor," designed to assist one million more women and their
families shake off poverty by the end of century.
</P>
<P>
China's poor people mainly live in remote mountainous areas,
deserts, the Loess Plateau, border areas, areas with high
incidence of endemic disease, and regions around reservoirs in
central and western China.
</P>
<P>
With funding and other assistance from society, governments and
international organizations, women in these areas have launched a
number of programs to eliminate poverty in line with the local
natural environment and economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The "Poverty Elimination Chain" program launched by women in
the Luliang area in north China's Shanxi Province is one of their
successes. Under the program, one family with technical know-how
is responsible for helping a number of families, who in turn
spread the expertise to more families.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that 51,870 families in this mountainous area
have overcome poverty thanks to the chain of assistance, and 70
percent of the women have learned one or two useful techniques.
</P>
<P>
Giving full play to women's leading role in a family, poverty
elimination efforts initiated by women have spurred on economic
development in poor areas, according to the Leading Group for
Aiding the Poor under the State Council. The group pledged that
the central government will continue to support these programs in
terms of policy, funding and information.
</P>
<P>
Last year, three million illiterate Chinese women learned to
read and write, 10.2 million rural women received training in new
farming techniques, and 276,000 women shook off poverty.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Increasing Economic Co-operation with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning Province will
increase economic cooperation with Hong Kong after its return to
the motherland on July 1, Wen Shizhen, its governor, told
reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is the biggest overseas investor in
Liaoning, with about 5,000 joint ventures there. The amount of its
investments has reached 7.8 billion US dollars, accounting for a
third of the total overseas cash flow into the province.
</P>
<P>
Hong Hong is also the biggest customer of the province's
products, and the volume of its trade with the province makes up a
third of the province's total last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong investors, who used to put their money into the
service industry and real estate, have started increasing
investment in local industrial projects," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong investors signed contracts for 46 joint
ventures, involving more than 10 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that Hong Kong investors are quite confident about
the motherland's reform of state-owned enterprises," the governor
noted.
</P>
<P>
The province, as the most important industrial production base
in China, will encourage local enterprises to issue H-shares and
to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The province is reported to be considering transfering some
rights to operate the Shenyang-Dalian Highway to Hong Kong
businesses, to raise funds for its money-losing state-owned
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> German Gov't, Bundesbank at Odds Over Plans to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite strong opposition from the
German central bank, Bonn's ruling coalition today vowed to hold
onto a government plan to revalue the bank's gold reserves within
this year in a bid to help Germany meet the single European
currency standards.
</P>
<P>
The plan unveiled earlier this month by Finance Minister Theo
Waigel to bring the traditionally undervalued central bank
reserves near the actual market value has met a storm of protests
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this afternoon, the German central bank,
Bundesbank, said that Waigel's plan would interfere in its
accounting practices, thus compromising its independence.
</P>
<P>
The plan also broke rules for the new European Union (EU)
central banking system and would undermine the confidence in the
planned single currency, called the Euro, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn ruling coalition, consisting of the Christian
Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union
and the junior partner Free Democratic Party, maintained that the
government would not spend any of the money gained by revaluing
the Bundesbank reserves. It would only be used to draw down a debt
of 350 billion marks (207 billion U.S. dollars) left over by
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following immediately the one issued by the
Bundesbank, Bonn's ruling parties insisted that they would press
ahead with the plan by passing legislation before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
This would force the Bundesbank to pay an increased dividend to
the federal government, thus helping bring Germany's public debt
in line with one of the Euro benchmarks which requires countries
to bring their public debt under 60 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in order to qualify for the 1999 launching of the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
Bonn said it wanted to free 20 billion marks (11.8 billion
dollars) from the move.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank said in its statement that it would be willing
to revalue its reserves upwards in 1999 as part of the European
Monetary Union, but objected to being forced to do so immediately.
</P>
<P>
The plan in Bonn has also met strong opposition from other EU
countries, like France and Italy, which accuse Germany of playing
fiscal trickery in order to meet Euro standards.

economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>

Menem and German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met today in

Latin America and the European Union (EU).

</P>
<P>
Menem also told reporters that during his talks with German
business leaders over the past few days, the German side had

<HEADLINE> UN Says Allegations Against UN in Guatemala Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. spokesman said today
that press allegations against United Nations members in Guatemala
in connection with the so-called "Mincho case" are groundless.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard told the U.N. press that Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has been kept informed of the allegations and considers
these reports to be "without foundations."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the secretary-general decided last week
that a team from headquarters should visit Guatemala on a
preliminary fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general trusts that the findings of this mission
will consolidate the confidence placed in MINUGUA by the people of
Guatemala and by the international community and allow the mission
to revert fully to its important verification and
institution-building tasks," he said.
</P>
<P>
MINUGUA refers to the U.N. human rights mission in Guatemala.
The New York Tims carried an article Sunday alleging the mission
knew that the Guatemalan government kidnapped a guerrilla named
Mincho last October.
</P>
<P>
It said that for the sake of the peace process, the U.N.
intentionally ignored the fate of Mincho. But in a latest report,
the U.N. said it knows nothing about the kidnapping, which the
Guatemalan government said was not true. This has thus prompted a
figure pointing between the United Nations and the Guatemalan
government.

<HEADLINE> US Yet to Decide Who Joins NATO First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has yet to
make a decision on which countries should be included in the first
wave of the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), a senior State Department official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We have not made a decision," Robert Simmons, deputy
director of the State Department Office of European Security and
Political Affairs, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
NATO's 16 foreign ministers, including U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, are meeting in Sintra, Portugal, Thursday to
discuss which countries should be in the first group to be invited
to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Washington has not made any public statement on which countries
NATO should accept as new members first. Currently 12 countries,
almost all of which are the former Warsaw Pact members, have
applied for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
However, Simmons said he believes that three to five countries
will be in the first group to be admitted to the alliance.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia are
reportedly on top of the list.
</P>
<P>
"This is a horse race; those are five horses that are in the
lead," he said, adding the U.S. has not made its choice.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the Founding Act between NATO and Russia has
cleared the way for the alliance's eastward expansion. NATO
leaders will convene a special summit on the enlargement in Madrid
in July.
</P>
<P>
"The two big steps ahead are to make the who-decision, and to
have a demonstrable and clear policy that the door is open to
further membership after the first group," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say these are difficulties; these are policy issues
that we face must be decided in Madrid."
