   INDIA-ROY (New Delhi) _ With their pride still measured in
megatons, and a strut still in their step after showing they can
explode nuclear bombs with the best of them, most of India's elite
did not want one of their own telling them, ``The air is thick with
ugliness and there's an unmistakable stench of fascism in the
air.'' This assessment came from Arundhati Roy, who ascended into
international literary stardom last year with her first novel,
``The God of Small Things'' (Random House), In a haunting
8,000-word essay by Ms. Roy, ``The End of Imagination.'' Deeply
personal, poetically penned, unsparingly harsh, it lambastes the
nation's main political parties and calls the bomb a ``final act of
betrayal by a ruling class that has failed its people.'' By Barry
Bearak.

came to a screeching halt Wednesday, renewing concerns about
Russia's ability to manage $40 billion in ruble-denominated debt,
roughly 10 percent of which is held by foreign investors. But
Western investors and banks could face greater losses from the
complex financial instruments known as derivatives. Indeed, the
amount of Russian derivatives at risk for foreign investors may be
sharply higher than that of bonds and loans. By Timothy L. O'Brien.

fact be trademarked. The Art Deco spire of the Chrysler Building is
a registered trademark (No. 1126888). So is the neo-classical
facade of the New York Stock Exchange (No. 1761655). Even the
Manhattan White Pages needed permission to depict ``Patience,'' one

   SCIARC-STUDENTS (Los Angels) _ Back to school, the time of
notebooks and protractors and sales circulars, has become one of
the basic seasons of American marketing. Even adults decades out of
the classroom can succumb to the pitch; it evokes certain primal
school-day sights and smells and textures. At the Southern
California Institute of Architecture (SciArc), the once-renegade
school whose influence has shaped the look of design in Los
Angeles, back-to-school means something different. There,
first-year students don't buy stuff; they build their own desks. By
Phil Patton.

   HOME-RENOVATION (Undated) _ We didn't start with the idea of
renovating our house in Pleasantville, N.Y., a 3,000-square-foot
Cotswold cottage on steroids. The house, built in 1907, has what
the folks in real estate like to call character, which means that
it takes a lot of character to live there, because nothing works
properly. No, we started with the idea of moving. By Ben Cheever.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Last week Phyllis Lambert, the
formidable doyenne of architecture, whose youthful rebellion
against her father, liquor tycoon Samuel Bronfman, resulted in the
construction of the Seagram Building in 1958, announced that she
had chosen her successor as director of the Canadian Center for
Architecture in Montreal. Kurt W. Forster, founding director of the
Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities at the Getty
Center in Los Angeles and, currently, chairman of the Department of
Art and Architecture at the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich will assume the directorship of the center on March 1, 1999.
The Swiss-born scholar, 63, is expected to bring a considerable
measure of international cache and academic integrity to the center
that Ms. Lambert founded, using her own inheritance money, in 1979.

   NJ-ARTS-CARPET (Newark, N.J.) _ Usually it's a bronze statue, an
old schoolhouse or a stately home that becomes the symbol of a
town. But the new contender in Newark is a colorful 12- by 92-foot
carpet, an addition to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center,
installed last Thursday in the entrance foyer. ``It's
Afrocentric,'' observed Lynne Falanga, of Watchung, N.J., who
attended a concert at the center on Sunday. ``They're incorporating
the neighborhood into the arts center, and that's the best part
about it.'' By Joseph Giovannini.

IRENE KRAUS, 74, NUN WHO LED HOSPITAL CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a
high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business
ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six
years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters
of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in
Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was
administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life
might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of
St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded
largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular
career path that would have allowed her to become president of the
nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   But then for Sister Kraus, who grew up in Philadelphia, the
religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion.
Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her
religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a
Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes
and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ``he
would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would
pray, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton
High School in Baltimore, Sister Kraus graduated at 17 in 1941 and
immediately joined the religious order.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years
teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond, Va. Then
her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college
education and asked her to switch to a medical career.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of
America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room
supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with
such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made
administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in
Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran
for the order.
</P>
<P>
   When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of
Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986,
Sister Kraus was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect
and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19
other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more
than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal
and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of
meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an
efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious
order gave Sister Kraus other advantages. In a business world where
women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on
how to dress for success, Sister Kraus never had a wardrobe worry.
Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception,
she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue
dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a
hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Kraus, a raconteur
with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and
rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Kraus, a tall,
imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into
an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal
dinner to ``work the room,'' Sister Kraus would be easy to track:
She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   During a career in which she served on more than 70 national
boards and committees, Sister Kraus became accustomed to being the
only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first
woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association,
she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She
told the board, ``I didn't work this hard to get here and have my
title changed.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her accomplishments as president of the national system,
Sister Kraus, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was
still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital
system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her
proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for
the national chain. The first four, including treating people with
respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar
religious principles. The fifth, ``Be Creative to Infinity,''
sounded exactly like Sister Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Kraus is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and
Marguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of
Willards, Md. &QL;

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES STAY CLEAR OF PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Democratic candidates are distancing themselves
from President Clinton, fearing that independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report on the investigation of the president may somehow
cost them votes in this year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-day campaign swing aimed at highlighting some of
the Democrats' best chances for taking back control of the House,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., has been forced to walk the
line between supporting the president's policies and appearing to
defend Clinton personally as he battles to overcome the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the president. I've worked well with him, and I trust
him. But I'm as disappointed as anybody at what happened,''
Gephardt told reporters who questioned him about the matter at
every stop in Kentucky, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission of an ``inappropriate relationship'' with
Lewinsky and accusations of perjury and cover-up have made him an
unwelcome figure on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   None of the hopefuls Gephardt campaigned for appeared willing to
have Clinton in their districts, and a few said that a visit from
the president, given his ``personal problem,'' would distract from
their efforts to focus on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd end up talking more about his problems than the issues,''
said Democrat Rob Tully of Dubuque, Iowa, who's trying to unseat
Republican incumbent Jim Nussle. But Tully was quick to add that he
does support the president on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   A few candidates, however, said they would like to have first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton make an appearance on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Lydia Spotswood of Kenosha, Wis., who said she would
welcome the first lady's help in her fight to defeat incumbent
Republican Mark Neumann in the 1st Congressional District, believes
most voters are tired of hearing about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to stop the Jerry Springer show in
Washington,'' she said. She acknowledged that the scandal is ``a
serious matter'' but said it was time ``to move on to issues that
affect people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has called Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky
``reprehensible'' and raised the prospect that Starr's report could
prompt impeachment hearings. But he has also said it was best to
take a ``wait and see'' approach and suggested that Starr in the
end may not even deliver a report outlining any impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews as he flew across the Midwest,
Gephardt also cautioned reporters not to ``ever count Bill Clinton
out'' and suggested that if Republicans tried to push for
impeachment without clear grounds, ``this thing could backfire on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he added, ``the president deserves the
presumption that there's nothing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of his relationship with the
former White House intern, his aides have been trying to shore up
support among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt acknowledged Wednesday that he had been called by White
House chief of staff Erskine Bowles after his ``reprehensible''
remark appeared in the morning papers. But he insisted that Bowles
did not pressure him to be more supportive.
</P>
<P>
   He said their conversation focused on the fall's legislative
agenda, except when Bowles said, ``the president was really sorry
about all this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I know he is,'' Gephardt added.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned on behalf of Democratic candidates, speaking
about health care reform, Social Security and education, the
minority leader insisted that the Democrats' hopes this fall of
picking up the 11 seats they need to retake the House would not
rise or fall on the presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are worried more than anything about the effect
scandal could have on voter turnout. A low turnout could prove
disastrous for Democrats since the Republicans have always been
good at turning out their core supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he hopes that Clinton's apology to the country,
which he called ``a courageous'' and ``forthright'' statement, will
help ease voter concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can still be an effective leader. People give him a
high rating because he's done a good job, and I think he'll
continue to do that,'' he added.

FRANCESCO CRUCITTI, POPE'S PERSONAL SURGEON, DIES AT 67
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Francesco Crucitti, who performed emergency surgery on
Pope John Paul II after an assassination attempt in 1981 and went
on to become his personal surgeon, died in Rome Wednesday. He was
67.
</P>
<P>
   Crucitti, a professor of surgery at the medical school of the
Catholic University of Italy, had been suffering from prostate
cancer and had recently undergone surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who had come into Rome on Wednesday from his summer
residence at Castel Gandolfo for a regular weekly audience, later
traveled to Crucitti's home near the center of the city to offer
condolences to his widow, Alessandra, and the couple's three
children. The pope said he had come `'to show you in some way my
appreciation for this man who saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Crucitti had last operated on the Pope in 1996, when he
performed a 50-minute operation at the Catholic University Agostino
Gemelli Hospital, on the edge of Rome, to remove the pope's
appendix. Four years earlier, when John Paul was 72, Crucitti
performed an operation of almost four hours to excise a large tumor
from the pope's colon and to remove his gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
   That operation, which was performed in an atmosphere of
unaccustomed secrecy, prompted speculation that the tumor was
malignant. But at a news conference after the operation, Crucitti
dispelled suggestions that the growth was cancerous, describing it
as ``absolutely benign.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic moment in Crucitti's career came in May
1981, when he was called on to perform almost six hours of
emergency surgery on the pope after a bullet fired by a gunman,
Mehmet Ali Agca of Turkey, perforated the pope's abdominal cavity.
Later that year, Crucitti operated on the pope to restore the
normal functioning of his intestines by reversing a colostomy
performed on the day of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Crucitti, who headed one of the Gemelli Hospital's three
surgical units at the time , had been examining patients in a
nearby hospital when a nun told him that the pope had been shot. On
the way to the Gemelli Hospital, where the pope had been taken by
ambulance from the scene of the shooting at the Vatican, Crucitti
is said to have stopped a policeman to ask for an escort, pleading,
``I am the surgeon who will operate on the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview with The New York Times, Crucitti later
recalled that he had worked at a hectic pace, first to stop the
pope's internal bleeding, then to repair the extensive damage done
to his intestines. ``The pope's blood pressure was dropping
rapidly,'' Crucitti said, ``but he was not in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the operation, Crucitti described the
pope's condition as grave. ``The course of the next hours and the
next few days will give us the answer, which we hope will be
favorable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in this century that a pope had been
treated outside the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after the operation to remove John Paul's appendix,
Crucitti was asked about a trembling that noticeably affected the
pope's left hand. The condition had given rise to speculation that
the pope was suffering from Parkinson's Disease or a related
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Crucitti avoided giving a direct answer, but he acknowledged for
the first time that the pope was being treated for an ailment that
he declined to discuss further. Since then, Vatican officials have
confirmed that the pope suffers from a form of Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Reggio Calabria on Nov. 17, 1930, Crucitti earned
degrees in medicine and surgery at the University of Bologna in
1952, and later specialized in surgery and urology at the
University of Padua. He worked first at the University of Padua
medical school, becoming professor of surgical pathology there in
1963. In 1967, he was called to be deputy director of the institute
of clinical surgery at the Catholic University medical center, in
Rome, where he remained, advancing to become professor of general
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Crucitti, an amiable and witty man, is known to have admonished
John Paul frequently to lighten his work load and to find more time
to rest, and the doctor occasionally suggested that his patient was
less than cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a news conference after the appendectomy in 1996,
Crucitti said, ``We have told the pope to rest.'' Asked whether he
believed that Pope John Paul, who continued to follow a grueling
schedule, would heed that advice, Crucitti replied, ``Ah, now that
remains to be seen.''

STARWOOD EXPECTED TO SHIFT TO BASIC CORPORATE STATUS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the world's largest
lodging company, is expected to announce Thursday that it will
convert to a standard corporate structure from an unusual real
estate investment trust and make the trust a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in White Plains, N.Y., is also expected to
announce that it will buy back about $1 billion worth of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of its change in status will answer a question
mark that has been hanging over Starwood for months. Starwood
recently lost a battle with Congress and the White House to extend
the tax advantages of its unusual corporate structure as a ``paired
share'' real estate investment trust, or REIT.
</P>
<P>
   The pending change has raised questions among many investors
about how it will affect Starwood's performance despite assurances
from Starwood executives that its assets, rather than its corporate
structure, are the company's real strength.
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts have dragged down Starwood shares, although many
lodging stocks have also slumped as investors have feared that
hotel companies might be overbuilding. Investors in Starwood, which
has acquired Westin Hotels and ITT in the last year, are also
watching each quarterly report carefully to see whether Starwood
executives can wring both savings and additional revenue from all
its acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mueller, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, said the change to a more typical corporate structure
would most likely generate interest in Starwood among a broader
range of shareholders, particularly with the expected stock
buyback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, it sounds like a structure that makes a lot of
sense for the company and is good for the shareholder,'' Mueller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Starwood rose 50 cents Wednesday, to $42.50. The
company's stock is down 31 percent since its most recent high of
$61.50 last October.
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate investment trusts pass on much of their income
to investors through dividends and therefore pay little or no
federal tax. But in the early 1980s, many trusts managed to
affiliate themselves with active real estate managers, giving them
greater flexibility and creating situations in which the REIT can
effectively lease property back to itself. In such cases, the
management company, which is considered a separate entity and is
subject to federal taxes, is paired with the REIT. Together, the
two trade as one stock. In 1984, Congress disallowed the creation
of any additional paired-share REIT's, but allowed some, including
Starwood and its predecessor, to continue to operate in this
fashion until this year.

ANALYSIS: EVEN YANKEES HAVE POSTSEASON CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four consecutive losses probably won't prevent the
Yankees from challenging the American League and Major League
single-season records for victories, because the depth of their
lineup and starting rotation and their collective drive will allow
them to build new winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
   But they have problems, some apparent, some small but festering,
that could easily derail them in the postseason, when the caliber
of competition improves dramatically, when small weaknesses become
the difference between winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The veteran reliever Mike Stanton claimed responsibility for
two of the Yankees' first three losses in their slump, accepting
the blame and the hurricane of boos aimed in his direction. But
Stanton, who pitched two solid innings in Wednesday afternoon's 6-4
loss in the first game of a double-header with the Angels (the
Yankees won the second game, 7-6), is only part of a larger
problem. The Yankees' middle relief is in almost total disarray,
and must be fixed before the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees possess excellent starting pitching and a superb
closer in Mariano Rivera. But in the postseason, at-bats are longer
and starting pitchers generally throw more pitches and last fewer
innings; a bridge of relief between the starter and the closer is
needed. The Yankees won the pivotal fourth game of the World Series
in 1996 because the Atlanta Braves lacked middle relief, because
the bullpen wasn't deep enough to get three or four crucial outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had the personnel for a good middle relief corps in
April. Since then, the right-hander Jeff Nelson, an important
element of the bullpen, suffered a disk injury in his lower back;
he is rehabilitating and some within the organization believe
there's a 50-50 chance he'll come back _ to what degree of
effectiveness after three months of inactivity, nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton had been terrible until Wednesday, with an 8.55 earned
run average since the beginning of June, and he appears caught in a
spiral of anxiousness. The worse he throws, the harder he tries,
and the harder he tries, the worse he throws. Torre believes
Stanton will rebound, and Wednesday might be a step in that
direction. Stanton is healthy, he has good stuff, opponents were
batting just .239 against him before Wednesday's games and he
understands he has a problem, the first step to repair.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying a suitable right-handed middle reliever is a far
more complex question. If Nelson is lost for the season or doesn't
regain his effectiveness, Torre has several alternatives. Ramiro
Mendoza has pitched effectively, but he doesn't generate strikeouts
and recently, he came down with a case of tendinitis after pitching
in three consecutive games. Mike Buddie, hit hard Monday and
Tuesday, is too inexperienced for the role, and like his fellow
sinker-baller Mendoza, he gets ground balls, not strikeouts and
pop-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's best option to replace Nelson appears to be shifting
Orlando Hernandez from the rotation to the bullpen. Like Nelson,
Hernandez dominates right-handed batters with his sidearm slider
(they are hitting .149 against him); he struck out Juan Gonzalez in
three consecutive at-bats recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez has never pitched in relief, nobody knows if he
could pitch effectively on consecutive days, and he usually
requires an inning or two to find his bearings. Opponents are
hitting .282 against him in the first 30 pitches of his starts this
season, .215 afterward. As a middle reliever, he would not have
that luxury. Torre cannot simply wait until the playoffs begin to
switch Hernandez. He needs to experiment, to test Hernandez in
relief. There's no time like the present.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's a baseball cliche: A singles hitter bangs a couple of
home runs and then stops hitting singles as he tries to hit home
runs. But the cliche applies to Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees
lead-off hitter. Knoblauch has a staggering 13 home runs since the
All-Star break, and in the process his swing has, in the jargon of
the day, become very big. He has stopped doing many of the things
that have made him a great leadoff hitter in his career.
</P>
<P>
   In five seasons leading up to this year, Knoblauch averaged 1.41
ground balls for every fly ball, a ratio that reflects the approach
of a hitter spraying line drives all over the field. In the last
two months, he has averaged 0.68 ground balls for every fly ball.
He had a .385 on-base percentage before the All-Star break, .309
since, going into Wednesday's games. He came to the Yankees with a
reputation as an excellent bunter, but almost never bunts. Over the
last few days, Knoblauch appears almost to be leaping at the ball
with a vicious uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has said time and again he wants Knoblauch to think about
line drives, not home runs. When the Yankees traded for Knoblauch,
they wanted him for his ability to get on base and drive the
offense. With his current approach, he would be a liability in the
postseason, when the pitchers are better and smarter and more
careful.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees ran the bases aggressively and smartly in the
first months, leading the league in stolen bases. At least two
opposing managers, Oakland's Art Howe and the Royals' Tony Muser,
suggested the Yankees' base running was the most underrated aspect
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Torre expected opponents to watch his team more carefully and
keep them from stealing bases, because with the exception of
perhaps Derek Jeter and Knoblauch, they don't have great
base-stealing talents, just good, smart base-runners.
</P>
<P>
   For one reason or another _ maybe the team's recent reliance on
home runs _ the Yankees have stopped running, and temporarily lost
that mind-set. They have just nine stolen bases in their last 17
games, but much more important than that is the sudden increase in
base-running mistakes. Jeter and O'Neill forgot the number of outs
just innings apart two weeks ago, Joe Girardi once failed to follow
the direction of the third-base coach, Willie Randolph, and Jeter
made a crucial mistake Tuesday. Teams win in the postseason because
they capitalize on mistakes, not commit them.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month remains before the playoffs and the Yankees
are a great team and will finish the year with a great record. But
like every team, they have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Chicago Cubs won 116 games and lost the World Series,
the 1954 Cleveland Indians won 111 games and set the American
League record for victories, and they lost the World Series. &QL;

MERCK ACCEPTS POLICY ON CARE UNIT PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. and its Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC unit have
agreed with the Federal Trade Commission to bar Medco from
discriminating against drugs made by Merck's competitors or
exploiting private marketing information about other drug makers
that Medco receives.
</P>
<P>
   Merck said Wednesday that the agreement formalized policies and
practices that it voluntarily adopted more than three years ago.
Merck bought Medco for $6.6 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care drug units like Medco and similar units of Eli
Lilly (Eli) &AMP; Co. and SmithKline Beecham PLC buy drugs at discounts
from an array of manufacturers in return for delivering high-volume
sales through employer drug plans and health maintenance
organizations. The managed care unit helps Merck win the business
of the HMOs and other drug plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the FTC staff, Merck-Medco must offer
customers a wide-ranging choice of drugs called an ``open
formulary,'' which are selected by an independent committee of
physicians and other experts. Merck has to operate Medco as an
independent unit, separated from the parent company by procedural
barriers called a firewall.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly has a similar formal agreement with the commission, and
SmithKline observes similar rules under an informal understanding,
a SmithKline spokeswoman said
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will be sent to the commission for review and
formal approval.
</P>
<P>
   Per G.H. Lofberg, president of Merck-Medco, said the unit
realized from the start that it had to be independent to compete
with the other managed care drug units. To do so, it had to keep
the confidence of other drug makers that are the sole suppliers of
popular products.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said it was hard to judge the effectiveness
of the managed care drug units for companies that own them. Lilly
has acknowledged that it paid far too much when it bought PCS
Health Systems from the McKesson Corp. for $4.1 billion. It took a
$2.4 billion charge last year, reflecting second thoughts about the
value of PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Southeast Research
Partners, said that Merck regularly announced that it was satisfied
with the ability of Medco to increase the Merck share of U.S. drug
sales, now approaching 15 percent. But he said that a surge in
recent years in advertising to consumers of prescription drugs like
Merck's Propecia for male baldness and Lilly's Prozac had had a big
role in sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Sweig said that Medco profits were slim in comparison with Merck
profits, so the success of Medco, which had been increasing the
number of its members by 20 percent to 30 percent annually, had led
to ``a dilution of Merck's gross profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, companies like Merck and Lilly hope to lock in
sales to managed care consumers through disease-management
programs, which supply them with educational materials about
illnesses like diabetes, asthma and arthritis. The aim is to have
patients faithfully take their medicine, enhancing drug sales,
while saving on potential hospital and doctor costs.

A MAJOR CONCERN
</HEADLINE>

By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the year's major championships recorded history, Phil
Mickelson again finds himself with the title ``Best Player on Tour
Never to Have Won a Major.''
</P>
<P>
   Others got the glory that comes with winning a major while
Mickelson, one of the game's most talented players, waits. He's 0
for 26 in the game's major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson has already strung together a fine season, winning the
Mercedes Championship and the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro Am.
He's earned $1.5 million to rank sixth on the PGA Tour's money
list.
</P>
<P>
   He possesses one of the game's best swings, is Hollywood
handsome and a Houdini with an L-wedge in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He's a member of an elite fraternity of golfers you'd buy a
ticket to watch, players like Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, Ernie Els,
Tom Lehman, Greg Norman, Mark O'Meara and Justin Leonard. But these
guys have all crossed the major threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Now no one else on tour is close to being in Mickelson's class
when it comes to promise unfulfilled. For proof you only have to
consult the legacy that trails him from tournament to tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson won the 1991 Northern Telecom Open while an amateur.
He turned professional the next year. He has won 13 tournaments
worldwide since then. He is the fourth youngest player to reach the
10-win mark, which puts him in the company of Horton Smith, Jack
Nicklaus and Gene Sarazen, golfers who are legends. And only
Nicklaus, Woods and Mickelson won NCAA and U.S. Amateur titles in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   So in the record books he is keeping good company. For most of
the players on tour this would be a great career.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's resume does include what's considered a significant
victory, the 1996 NEC World Series of Golf, a tournament being
played this week and with a field a cut above other events. The
NEC's stature grows next year when it gets an image transplant,
becoming the NEC Invitational, and a field made up mostly of the
most recent members of the Ryder Cup and President's Cup teams. It
will be one of four new World Golf Championship events put together
for the America, Europe, Japan, South Africa and Australasia tours.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's win in 1996 gave him a 10-year exemption onto the
PGA tour, so he does not have to worry about retaining his playing
privileges while pursuing his elusive goal. It proves he can win a
big event.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, during the week of the PGA Championship, ``Golf
World'' magazine pondered in a cover story whether Mickelson is
tough enough to win a major. After reading it, Mickelson said the
reporting was fair. Then he shot himself out of contention with a
78 on Saturday, again rendering a major Sunday insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   His response to a shattered dream was that golf is just a game
and Saturday's round was not the end of the world. He shot a 67 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in the final round of the rain-delayed AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am, he recorded another 67 to win that title.
</P>
<P>
   Then last weekend he shot a plus 41 under the Modified
Stableford system to finish high on the leader board at the Sprint
International.
</P>
<P>
   In an eight-day run, Mickelson banked $740,250, almost half his
year's winnings. He's fast becoming the richest golfer on the
planet not to have won a major and he wears that title with grace.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Masters is just eight months away. For Phil
Mickelson, that doesn't seem like such a long time to wait.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ A playwright could have a field day with the WNBA
championship series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are enough plots and subplots to keep a word processor
whirring for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, there's what figures to be a heated
best-of-three series for the 1998 title.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 is tonight at 7, when the defending champion Comets face
the Phoenix Mercury at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the continuation of one of the hottest rivalries to
develop over the first two years of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll guarantee you, I'd rather be in Cleveland right now,''
Comets coach Van Chancellor said Wednesday of the team the Mercury
beat Tuesday night to advance to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two best teams (in the WNBA) are in the
championships at this time of year,'' said Chancellor. ``What has
Phoenix done lately? Won eight out of 10? Nine out of 11 or
something like that? They're playing great basketball right now.
They had a little lull near the middle of the summer, but nobody
cares about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a dream matchup, if you want my honest
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The curtain is ready to rise on the first clash between two-time
Most Valuable Player Cynthia Cooper and Phoenix center and MVP
runner-up Jennifer Gillom since the results were announced earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about Cynthia Cooper vs. Jennifer Gillom,'' Cooper
said. ``This is about the Houston Comets against the Phoenix
Mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot is the antics of Mercury coach Cheryl Miller.
The postgame soliloquy she delivered to fans at America West in
July following a 65-62 loss to the Comets still seems to echo off
the walls of the Mercury's home building.
</P>
<P>
   The Basketball Hall of Famer guaranteed a championship victory
over the Comets that night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late-season streak during which the Mercury lost five
straight games and seven of nine immediately after Miller's speech,
she at least marshaled the troops enough to get them to the
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   Has there been any point since that night that Miller has
regretted her words?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never regret anything I've said. If you're going to say
something or do something, do it with conviction,'' Miller said,
bristling. ``Every now and then, you roll the dice. You might come
up lucky. We're happy to be here. We're just going to give it our
best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller sees no link between the speech and the Mercury's
subsequent slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to any team when they go into a skid?'' Miller
said. ``What happened to New York when they opened the season by
losing the first five?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team goes through that. There's no need of sitting up
here rehashing what happened, coulda, shoulda, woulda. We're here
at the finals and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought her words may come back to haunt the
Mercury now, if the Comets might not still gain motivation from
them, Miller delivered a placid answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think,'' she said, ``that if you're the defending
world champions, defending that crown should be first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't matter what Cheryl Miller thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   In four games during the regular season, the Mercury beat the
Comets once, 69-66 at America West on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets avenged that loss July 21 and ignited Miller's
postgame tirade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it ironic that we find ourselves back here on the scene
where she said that to the crowd?'' said Cooper, a former teammate
of Miller's at Southern Cal. ``I think that's great for women's
basketball. It will bring another 3,000 to 5,000 fans to the arena
to see the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, as I've said before, Cheryl doesn't get a chance to
come out on the court and play. She thinks she does. But I think
what she did served her team well. It motivated the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Phoenix is such a wonderful place to play. It's wonderful
because of the fan support, because of all the motivation Cheryl
brings to her team and also to the Mercury fans. It's going to be a
tough game; it's going to be a physical game. We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   So the stage is set. The ESPN and Lifetime cameras and lights
are in place. On with the show.

US WEST ADS GALVANIZE STRIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
 WEST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through their second week, striking US West workers are
piping hot, but not from the sweltering Arizona heat.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers are steamed by an advertising campaign they say is
misleading and makes them more determined than ever to outlast the
company in a bid for a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gosiger, president of the Communication Workers of America
Local 7019, said the strikers get rejuvenated every time the
company runs an ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we are under attack from the leaders of this
company, but they are underestimating workers. (Workers) are
getting more charged up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, representatives of US West and the Communication
Workers of America met with federal mediator Jim Mahan for a fourth
consecutive day. No major progress was reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like we're kind of in a shouting match right
now,'' said Carla West, a union representative in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed issues remain mandatory overtime, health-care
benefits and a performance-pay proposal. Both sides have agreed not
to discuss their specific proposals publicly while talks are under
way.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, strikers say what they perceive as attempts by the
company to undermine the solidarity of the union have only
galvanized them further.
</P>
<P>
   Those include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A series of full-page newspaper ads that union officials say
are misleading and full of half-truths.
</P>
<P>
   _A decision by the company to cancel strikers' medical benefits
effective Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ The employment of private detectives to videotape and
photograph strikers.
</P>
<P>
   _Intimating that the strikers in US West's 14-state region may
be responsible for about 121 acts of reputed vandalism since the
strike began Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   _ Obtaining a court order preventing union members from
threatening or intimidating US West managers and others working
during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   To Patrick Obermeyer, a Phoenix cable repairman picketing
Wednesday at Third Street and Earll Drive, the company's decision
to cancel the striking workers' medical benefits starting Monday
was a contemptuous act and a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I'd rather find another job than cross that picket
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union representative Peggy Dewey said she used to be proud to
work for US West, but the company's actions during the strike have
changed that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   She is particularly angry over a series of newspaper ads run by
US West that she says distort the issues over which the workers are
striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ad made it look like they proposed to cap forced overtime
at 12 hours a week,'' she said. ``But it didn't say that was after
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The overtime proposal would include unlimited forced overtime
this year, 25 hours per week in 1999, 20 in 2000, 15 in 2001 and 12
in 2002. Forced overtime, which for some employees is now more than
30 hours a week, is one of the key issues over which the company
and the union disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey pointed to another statement in the ad that claimed the
company was offering free health insurance to all employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't say that to continue with the coverage we now get
for free, employees will have pay about $70 per month out of their
own pocket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gosiger called a court order the company received against the
union Tuesday a public-relations stunt and another example of the
company's attempt to undermine the union and sway public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The order, issued by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge John
R. Sticht of Phoenix, prohibits the union and its members from
engaging in acts or threats of force, violence, bodily harm,
property damage or vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   US West spokesman Jim Roof said the court order was obtained to
curb rising acts of vandalism against the company and the
harassment by strikers of managers and other employees still on the
job. Vandalism in the Phoenix area primarily involves cut wires in
service boxes where several hundred individual lines connect to
larger cables.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said that since the strike began Aug. 15, there have been
about 25 instances of such vandalism in Phoenix. The rate is
substantially higher than before the strike, he said. Although he
acknowledged that no one has actually witnessed any vandalism, he
said, ``Coincidence can only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the harassment of US West managers attempting to fill in
for the strikers, he said the acts are well documented. They
include barring service vehicles from leaving maintenance yards;
surrounding service vehicles in the field, thus disrupting repairs;
and surrounding and harassing workers in manholes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the service boxes, Gosiger said he suspects that service
personnel unfamiliar with their jobs are confusing the generally
poor condition of much of US West's system with vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the boxes they claimed were vandalized and they
looked like they always do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this week the union will begin running its own ads.
The television commercials will focus on the issue of forced
overtime, the one to which the union feels the public will be most
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dewey nor Gosiger sees the strike ending soon, although
Roof said he was encouraged by the fact that both sides were
talking for the fourth day in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, strikers are beginning to look for temporary jobs to
tide them over. With the tight labor market in Phoenix, most don't
think they'll have trouble finding work.
</P>
<P>
   At the CWA union hall in Phoenix, strikers peruse listings of
part-time jobs and pick up fliers from St Mary's Food Bank and
other community agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make $70 a day as a substitute teacher in Mesa,'' said
Warren Cole, a customer-service employee also picketing at Third
and Earll. ``With that and my strike pay, I can hold on
indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, 3,761 strikers will be entitled to $200 per
week in strike pay. The payments will come out of the CWA's $176
million strike fund. To qualify, members have to spend at least six
hours a week on the picket line. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: OVER FENCE CAME BEFORE OVER COUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th graf for update on McGuire's home run total) (See also: HERBERT-COLUMN) 
(JT) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In Mark McGwire's first time at bat in Little League
in Claremont, Calif., in 1974, he hit a home run over the fence. He
was 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in high school, he hit a ball so far that it cleared
a 320-foot fence, flew over a vacant lot and slammed into the wall
of a gymnasium an estimated 500 feet from home plate. When Mark
McGwire was at the University of Southern California, he whacked 32
home runs in one season (a Pacific-10 record).
</P>
<P>
   In his first full year in the big leagues, in 1987, he belted 49
homers to share the major league lead with Andre Dawson. He has
continued orbiting homers, including 58 last season.
</P>
<P>
   In each locale, McGwire, like every other athlete, sought to
make himself stronger, fresher, bigger, better. So the consumption
of choice began with lemonade, escalated to oranges and candy bars
(Snickers, he said) and on to broccoli and _ it's true _ spinach.
</P>
<P>
   As he draws closer to Roger Maris' single-season home run record
of 61 _ he hit No. 54 against the Florida Marlins on Wednesday
night and has 30 games left in the season _ the Cardinals' McGwire
has found something even dearer to his heart, and sinews, than
fruits, vegetables and sucrose. This year he began taking
androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement that is supposed to
enhance the benefits of daily workouts by strengthening body
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is legal in Major League Baseball and in the National
Basketball Association _ though banned in the National Football
League, and by the NCAA and the International Olympic Committee _
McGwire is breaking no rules. While the recent revelation that he
is using it has sparked a national debate, doctors still are not
sure of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   But, an inquiring public asks, is it McGwire or his pharmacist
who is responsible for splintering seats in the bleachers and the
upper decks?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has an obvious, and remarkable, natural athletic talent,
especially for hitting a baseball long distances, consistently. And
he has continued to work on it, and his body, with, apparently, an
uncommon devotion. He maintains a rigorous weight-lifting program,
and is said to study films of pitchers with the intensity of a
used-car dealer reading the fine print in a contract.
</P>
<P>
   He has got bigger _ and better _ as the years have progressed.
His stands 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 245 pounds, some 25 more than
when he broke into the major leagues in 1987. His arms are huge,
particularly his forearms, which, Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, said, ``look like calves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's only part of the story,'' Valentine said. ``He's
learned the strike zone better, his swing is more compact, and he's
much more disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   His manager, Tony La Russa, derides speculation that it is
something other than ability that is responsible for McGwire's
blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach timing in hitting a baseball, especially when
you're talking about hitting a 93-mile-an-hour slider,'' he said.
``And if it was just muscle and strength generating those home
runs, then you'd have every weight-lifter and offensive lineman
come off the street and start hitting balls over the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   The art and science of hitting a baseball go beyond that. It is
a particular skill that may elude even the greatest of athletes _
just as the finest chef may meet his bete noire with a pineapple
upside-down cake. Michael Jordan, for one, discovered in his
adventures in the minor leagues a few years ago that a curveball
dipping on the outside corner got the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't generate good bat speed,'' Valentine said. ``He
was all upper body.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players in the league acknowledge taking Andro, as the
supplement is called, including Jason Giambi of Oakland. Giambi has
20 homers, and Maris may rest easily about his challenge. The
knowledge, meanwhile, that one substance can enhance performance
while another cannot _ or to what degree _ still meets with
conflict within the sports and medical communities.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Major League Baseball and the players union jointly
asked doctors to gather information about players' use of
muscle-enhancing pills. Reckless or harmless, athletes have always
sought an edge. Steak, for example, was once considered the best
pre-game meal. Now it is disparaged, in favor of pasta. Ty Cobb
eschewed both in favor of sharpening his spikes.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on Mark David McGwire, however, is that he is
legitimately the most astonishing home run hitter the world has
known since George Herman Ruth ambled to the plate.

NEW TYPE OF ROCKET TO CARRY SATELLITES EXPLODES IN LIFTOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ An unmanned rocket carrying an advanced
communications satellite exploded here on Wednesday night less than
90 seconds after liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   The launching, at 9:17 p.m., was the maiden flight for a new
version of the Delta rocket, which had been designed by the Boeing
Co. to carry twice the payload of the old version.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came only two weeks after a government spy
satellite exploded here shortly after takeoff, dealing a blow to
the nation's space reconnaissance program.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta family of rockets has been in use for decades. The new
version, called Delta III, was designed to carry a payload of about
8,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's payload was a Galaxy X communications
satellite built by the Hughes electronics unit of the General
Motors Corp. The satellite had been built for use by the Panamsat
Corp., based in Greenwich, Conn., which intended to sell use of the
satellite to cable television carriers and telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A similar satellite, Galaxy IV failed this spring, cutting off
the use of pagers to many of the nation's millions of paging
customers. The Galaxy X was not meant as a direct replacement for
the Galaxy IV.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and Boeing would not immediately comment about the
failure on Wednesday night, but Daniel Marcus, a spokesman for
Panamsat, said: ``While the launch is a disappointment, it has
always been part of our comprehensive plan to cover events like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said that the satellite was fully insured and that the
company planned to proceed with a launching in three weeks in
French Guiana by the European space agency, Ariane.
</P>
<P>
   Panamsat officials said the cost of building, launching and
insuring the rocket and satellite was $200 million to $250 million.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BY my count, six Astros are on track to have career years. Two of
them, Moises Alou and Craig Biggio, are bona fide Most Valuable
Player candidates. Prorated over an entire season, Randy Johnson's
Houston numbers are Cy Young-sized. And Larry Dierker is a
garlic-strong contender for Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not exactly a shock that they've already won one fewer
game than they did all last season with 27 still to play. If they
stay their current course _ not an impossibility if they can avoid
lapsing into too many more brain-dead efforts like the one
Wednesday that produced a loopy 6-2 loss to the Braves _ they'll
finish 100-62 with a player payroll only modestly in excess of what
Atlanta spends on its starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are a jerry-rigged team, to be sure. Make that Gerry
with a G.
</P>
<P>
   Credit must be given where credit is due. As glorious a season
as it has been for a slew of guys with stars on their caps,
nobody's having a better year than the guy with stars in his eyes,
general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker could be National League Executive of the Year on the
strength of the Alou and Johnson deals alone. Throw in the lopsided
trades for Carl Everett (.315) and Sean Bergman (11-7), and he's in
a league of his own. Gerry really should win the title by a
unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   No joke _ Dierker can manage
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, he deserves retroactive points for the
unabashedly brilliant move of putting Dierker in the dugout.
Although club president Tal Smith suggested it and the first words
out of Hunsicker's agape mouth were, ``You must be joking,'' he
warmed to the idea quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Larry for 20 years,'' he said. ``I knew that he
knew baseball, and I thought he would create a comfortable
environment in the clubhouse for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dierker has.
</P>
<P>
   True, Hunsicker didn't re-sign Darryl Kile over the offseason, a
failure he calls ``easily my biggest disappointment.'' But if he
had kept Kile, Johnson wouldn't be here today and chances are
neither would Derek Bell (.304, 92 RBIs). With all due respect to
D.K., I'll take R.J. straight up, hands down. So what if he's most
likely just passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker could be batting 1.000 if free-agent acquisition Dave
Clark weren't batting .200. But Clark has been more effective as a
pinch hitter of late _ 9-for-20 since July 18 _ and Hunsicker,
feeling lucky with good reason, predicts: ``Dave's going to win
some games for us before the season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been breaking for Gerry, which is to say
smashingly well, Clark will probably sock the winning home run in
the bottom of the ninth inning in the seventh game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has a creative mind and keen baseball instincts, and
the Astros' fine-line, ``small-market'' circumstances demand both.
Their margin for error is minuscule. They can't throw money at
their shortcomings. They must outthink the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Change of scenery works
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Everett could have been a public-relations fiasco.
Cripes, his kids had been taken away from him for reasons of abuse,
a red-flag charge. But Hunsicker, who had been around Everett as a
Met and remembered him to be ``always smiling a good teammate,''
gambled that the situation wasn't as bad as was being reported in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. As an Astro, Everett's conduct has been exemplary. So
has his switch hitting, and fielding. The Carl Everett that
Hunsicker remembered couldn't finance, much less buy, a hit batting
righthanded. The Carl Everett he wound up with in Houston is just a
shade under .300 from the right side of the plate and a sound
center fielder to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman had a lousy night against the Braves, getting yanked
from a lost effort in the sixth inning. Remember, however, that he
came to Houston a career 18-27 pitcher who wasn't assured of a
roster spot when spring training began. That Bergman would be
attempting to notch a 12th victory before September says at least
as much about the roll Hunsicker has been on as Alou's 38 home runs
_ 15 more than he had ever hit before _ and the four ahh-inspiring
W's in five starts Johnson has recorded since his acrimonious
parting with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them could be construed as gambles, their respective
superstar credentials notwithstanding. Although Alou brought with
him a deserved reputation for producing in the clutch, he can be
difficult to handle. In a word, moody. And Johnson had been
behaving badly in Seattle, with statistics to match.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker thoroughly researched both, though, and concluded
their through-the-roof-good risk-reward ratios made adding them to
the Astros' roster imperative.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, this team, his team, is the best baseball team Houston
has ever had. Even if it didn't show up Wednesday night.

OUTSPOKEN CLARIDGE LEADS USC DOGGED LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ When USC offensive lineman Travis Claridge
looks to his left, he sees someone who has never played in a
college football game. When he looks to his right, there are three
lineman whose combined college experience equals less time than
Claridge played in an average quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world in which Claridge resides these days as the
only veteran of an untested line. Despite being younger than all
but one of the other four starters, Claridge is considered the
star, leader and emotional barometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be my rock out there,'' offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a role Claridge shies away from. Actually, there isn't
much the junior is afraid to tackle _ on or off the field. His
brutal honesty might rankle some, but his opinions can rarely be
challenged for their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing USC's often inept running game during the
previous two seasons, Claridge said, ``People are always saying the
offensive line (messed) up. Let's be honest, some of our backs were
blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time, it was because the running back would put
his head down and get to the hole and he would get smacked. They
couldn't find the holes. The only true runner was LaVale (Woods).''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of USC's line has been linked to many of the Trojans'
recent offensive woes, and those comments remain fresh to Claridge.
He believes the line has been unduly singled out ever since he
arrived at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go out and play my butt off for two years, but if you
lose games, the linemen get blamed,'' he said. ``If the defense
gets shredded, would you say Daylon McCutcheon was awful?''
</P>
<P>
   It's this attitude that makes him a natural leader, and USC has
little choice but to depend greatly upon him. The right tackle,
Matt Welch, is a junior college transfer who has not played
Division I football.
</P>
<P>
   The left tackle, Brent McCaffrey, barely made appearances in two
games last season. The center, Eric Denmon, made appearances in
four games two years ago and missed last season. Left guard Jason
Grain appeared in 10 games, but that was only on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge has started 23 games. An impressive feat considering he
started as a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the other guys will look at me to see how I react,''
Claridge said. ``I feel like I'm responsible because, when we line
up, I'm the only one who's been in a college game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Claridge is USC's top lineman, the new coaching
staff believes he still needs to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been extremely pleased with Travis,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``But frankly, there are some techniques he's had the
past two years that we need to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood said he's trying to keep Claridge's emotions from
taking over during a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't let himself get frustrated,'' Greatwood said. ``He
used to get real mad if a guy blew an assignment. Everyone's going
to have to perform. He can only do what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked like Claridge was going to be doing his
thing somewhere else. He was close to former assistant Mike Barry
and considered transferring when John Robinson was fired last
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to, but I didn't,'' Claridge said. ``I stuck it
out. You can't run from your problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the coaching change, there has been turmoil in his
personal life. His father, Bill, was diagnosed with cancer this
summer and a tumor was removed from his throat. ``It's been real
stressful for me,'' Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   He also misses his little brother, Ryan, a fullback who lives in
Michigan and is being recruited by Big Ten schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother lives in another state and I can't always be there
for him,'' Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough situation, but as Claridge has learned, it's always
a rough job to be a USC lineman.

MELVIN ARMS TEAM, BUT ONE BULLET A DUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Unless he saved one for himself, Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin fired his last bullet yesterday. Now,
it's up to the Rangers to save his ``executive of the year''
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least his job.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago, Melvin was being praised throughout
baseball for the astute deadline deals that, according to scouts,
league executives and media pundits, resulted in major upgrades in
starting pitching, at shortstop and at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Todd Stottlemyre is single-handedly threatening to make a
liar out of all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin added much-needed veteran left-hander Greg Cadaret to the
Rangers' bullpen yesterday. It will likely be the GM's final move
before postseason rosters must be set by midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to us to do something now,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said before the Rangers closed out their homestand with a
critical 8-6 victory against the Tigers. ``Doug's done all he can
do. The people in uniform have to do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what it takes here to win the division. We just have
to go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The message to his players is clear: No more excuses. No more
alibis. No more lapses of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent-wise, \Rthe Rangers\S are better than the Angels,''
Tigers dugout coach Larry Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   It's way past time to start playing like it.
</P>
<P>
   Considering almost five weeks remain in the season, a
gut-wrenching tension pervaded The Ballpark in Arlington last
night.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers' Frank Catalanotto, the game's second batter,
drove an Esteban Loaiza offering over the right-field fence for a
quick 1-0 Detroit lead, Rangers fans gulped.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-town scoreboard already showed that the Angels had
beaten the Yankees, 4-1, in the first game of a doubleheader at
Yankee Stadium, their third consecutive victory in New York. And
Anaheim led 1-0 early in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look like the guy who couldn't open the pickle jar,'' mused
a frustrated Rangers official, remembering that this team had just
lost five of seven to the Yanks, ``and the next guy makes it look
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, in a worst-case scenario that seemed well on its
way to becoming reality, were in danger of waking up five games
behind Anaheim in the American League West race this morning.
</P>
<P>
   And ``5'' is their magic number. That's how many games they have
left head-to-head with the Angels. Fall further back than that and
they'll be in the uncomfortable position of needing help from other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side _ a Yanks win in the nightcap and a Rangers
victory against the Tigers _ meant slicing a half-game off
Anaheim's lead.
</P>
<P>
   An aborted Angels comeback in the ninth, the Rangers holding off
the Tigers almost in spite of themselves and a round of
Alka-Seltzer for the house left the Rangers three games back as
they embark on a seven-game road trip to Chicago and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It would be patently unfair to lay all the Rangers' problems off
on Stottlemyre, but the veteran right-hander's glaring 7.03
earned-run average since he arrived has left Texas no better off
than before he arrived to replace struggling Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is worried and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \RStottlemyre\S is concerned about it, too,'' Melvin
said. ``But he's just got to keep going out there. Our scouts say
the stuff's still there. I told him the other day that we didn't
get him to come over here and be the savior. A lot of guys have to
pull their weight for us to be a successful team.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys like third baseman Todd Zeile, who made his ninth error
since being acquired in Melvin's July 31 blitzkrieg. And guys like
Gold Glove catcher Pudge Rodriguez, whose seventh throwing error on
a pickoff attempt at second base put the potential tying run in
scoring position with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Only some clutch relief work by Xavier Hernandez prevented the
Rangers' defensive lapses from costing them the game this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's trying hard,'' said outfielder Juan Gonzalez, who
drove in four more runs, ``but we need more concentration inside
the lines. We need something extra from everybody this last
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the Rangers need for Stottlemyre to become the
veteran leader of the rotation that they believed they were getting
when they traded for him.
</P>
<P>
   Some reputations _ and maybe the entire season _ are riding on
it. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7972

HUNDLEY EXPERIMENT IN LEFT FIELD GOES UP IN FLAMES
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last June, in the sweltering humidity of Port
St. Lucie, Fla., Todd Hundley said there might come a day when he
would tell New York Mets General Manager Steve Phillips to ``take
that catching gear and burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand experiment of turning Hundley into an outfielder had
just begun. On Wednesday, after 34 starts in left field _ some of
which were painful to watch _ the experiment is officially over.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets have a $4.8 million pinch-hitter sitting in the
dugout as they chase a wild-card berth and questions to answer
about their catcher position.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on Wednesday what he was going to do with his
outfielder's glove, Hundley said, ``Burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to catch again next year,'' Hundley said, although
he was unsure where. ``But we've got to deal with this year
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley made his impromptu announcement with Manager Bobby
Valentine standing nearby (almost like a chaperon) before Hideo
Nomo's 4-1 complete-game victory over San Francisco. While the Mets
lead the Cubs by one game and the Giants by two in the wild-card
race, it has been a year to forget for Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a career change at age 29 just doesn't work right
now,'' said Hundley, who is hitting .164 with 2 home runs and 11
runs batted in with 49 strikeouts in 110 at-bats. ``This is better
for the organization. It's been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, without a hit in his last 15 at-bats, was 0 for 3 and
struggled in the field during Tuesday night's 7-3 loss to the
Giants. When asked what he was going to do about his left-field
situation, Valentine said: ``Let's face it, left field hasn't been
a good situation for most of this year. I would say right now it
has to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine stopped short of saying he was going to bench Hundley,
but Hundley was not pleased when he was told of Valentine's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   He telephoned Valentine late Tuesday night at the team hotel to
discuss the situation. Hundley chose not to reveal what was said.
``It's not worth getting into,'' Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, meanwhile, refused to speculate on whether he might
have made the same decision had Hundley not phoned him first. When
asked if he had planned on abandoning the experiment on Wednesday
anyway, Valentine said: ``I planned on him getting more batting
practice. That's the only plan I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he intended to or not, however, Valentine opened the
door for the possibility of Hundley going to the bench. And there
was no question the experiment was not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both because of offense and defense,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was asked if his reconstructed right elbow was bothering
him. ``It's good enough,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   How about playing left field, then? ``It's so boring, it's
unbelievable,'' Hundley said, before walking away.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 11, the day Hundley made his major league outfield
debut, Hundley had improved his defense considerably from the
tragicomedy of his first couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But opposing teams were running at will on Hundley's tentative
defensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   And Hundley was not hitting enough behind Mike Piazza _ the man
who had taken his place behind the plate _ to justify an experiment
that at least one player said was unfair to the rest of his
teammates, what with the Mets in the middle of the wild-card chase.
</P>
<P>
   The same player had also said the situation was unfair to
Hundley, who was trying to shake off the rust of not facing major
league pitching for almost a year. But neither Hundley nor the
Mets' front office was willing to say they had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than not playing at all,'' Hundley said, when
asked if he would have been better not trying to come back this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said: ``I don't regret it. We would have had regrets if
we didn't try.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet one cannot help feeling sorry for Hundley, who hit 71
home runs the last two seasons before having to undergo serious
surgery last September, a May trade for Piazza a few days after he
was assured one would not be made, and a damaging leak in the
organization that was critical of Hundley's work and drinking
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all Hundley can hope for is that he will be able to catch
again before the season is over _ and that the Mets will include
him on the post-season roster should they qualify for the playoffs
for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was now worried that he would be left off,
Hundley, who has repeatedly said his only goal left is to play in
the playoffs, said: ``Yeah. I guess. That's part of it. But what
are you going to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve and I talked about it. I could come in, in a backup
catcher role and pinch-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who met with Hundley on Wednesday morning, said:
``There's no assurance for anybody. When we get to that point,
we'll make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Phillips said: ``I'm not going to get into a
catcher controversy. One guy's a free agent and we don't know if
he's coming back. The other guy's a catcher who can't catch right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with his outfield experiment behind him, it is clear
Hundley wants to get back behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the New York Mets, I don't know,'' he said. ``I'm not in
control of that.'' &QL;

FAA: SAFETY WAS SECOND PRIORITY AT AMERICA WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although America West executives say their record fine last
month was the result of procedural oversights, federal
investigators found that the company's maintenance problems stemmed
from a corporate culture that valued uninterrupted flights over
passenger safety.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration documents say the airline
``grossly mismanaged'' its maintenance operations before being hit
with the $5 million fine in July.
</P>
<P>
   America West President and Chief Executive Officer Richard
Goodmanson said he has not seen the reports but said the FAA's
conclusions were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reports were written by ``apparently junior FAA
investigators'' and said he was amazed that their tone did not
match the FAA's pronouncement last month that the airline was
operating safely.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' records, obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act request, document 11 cases that formed the basis
for the fine and settlement agreement with the Tempe-based airline.
</P>
<P>
   The cases suggest that the violations cited were not isolated
incidents, but instead resulted from a bottom-line corporate
focus. &QL; 
``The attitude of this carrier's management (is) that safety and
regulatory requirements are secondary to the continued movement of
aircraft within the carrier's route system,'' one inspector
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This culture, which permeates the carrier, lends credence to
the employees who conduct the day to day operations of the carrier
that it is OK to continue an operation even when there may be a
significant factor that could impede safety. This fact alone could
lead to a significant event resulting in a loss of life or
property.'' &QL; 
REPORT IS `OLD NEWS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goodmanson said that the company never urged employees to skirt
maintenance duties. Although the company had some rough going after
its controversial December 1995 decision to lay off its mechanics
and send heavy maintenance work to outside contractors, Goodmanson
said things had improved markedly by mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokesman who called ``The Republic'' after being alerted
to the story by America West, called the inspectors' reports ``old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA's position about America West is reflected in our
press release on July 14,'' Tim Pile said Thursday. ``And as of
today, they're in compliance with the settlement agreement, they've
met all of the requirements to date, and I hope your article
reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the FAA and America West agreed to a settlement that
calls for the airline to follow an even stricter maintenance regime
than contained in federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also agreed to immediately pay half of the $5
million fine. At $2.5 million, the fine is the largest ever for an
air carrier. The remaining $2.5 million is waived if America West
sticks to specific maintenance requirements over the next year. &QL; 
SOURCE OF CONTENTION &QL; 
America West has never had an accident, and the airline has the
second-best safety record in the industry, after Southwest
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But its maintenance history has been a source of contention,
especially since the 1995 layoffs and outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   According to a June 22 memo, FAA attorney Naomi Tsuda briefed
her supervisors on the airline's maintenance history to ``prevent
the FAA from being taken for a ride by (America West) management.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the FAA and the airline were holding settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuda said the FAA had launched a ``progressive enforcement
program'' to get the airline to follow maintenance regulations. The
program included a 1996 fine of $205,000 to settle six maintenance
cases, and a $49,000 fine to end the FAA's gripe about an Airbus
A-320 that flew 144 times without meeting all of its
heavy-maintenance require ments.
</P>
<P>
   The last fine was drastically reduced _ from a proposed $154,000
_ to allow America West to buy a computer to better track its
maintenance requirements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a strong arm is appropriate in dealing with AWXA
(America West), and any claims that they do not understand the
rules/regs or were unaware of the extent of the problems is less
than sincere,'' she wrote in the memo to her supervisors in the
FAA's Western Pacific legal division. &QL; 
COMPLAINTS BACKED UP &QL; 
Tsuda recapped America West's history because the FAA had recently
put a new attorney and new maintenance inspector on the case. A
month after she circulated her memo, the FAA assessed the record
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuda's complaints were backed up by an FAA inspector. In a
report this spring, he wrote that he warned company officials that
outsourcing was creating problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fell on deaf ears,'' he wrote. ``In fact, when apprised
of a violation and potential violations AWXA (America West) senior
management seemed to take the role of a large bird which is known
for sticking its head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodmanson acknowledged that the outsourcing has been a
particular problem between the FAA and the airline, but said it
remains a prudent move. Because America West has a comparatively
small fleet of planes (104), there is not enough heavy maintenance
work to keep a staff busy year round, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that purely for economic reasons,'' he said. ``If you
looked at it today, it's exactly the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, he said, has never liked the move to outsourcing
because it requires their inspectors to travel outside their home
territory. For example, America West now has its heavy maintenance
done by Air Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the FAA's complaints are technical, but generally minor,
Goodmanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are `taillights out' kind of stuff,'' he said, citing
the FAA's gripe that nine airplanes were found in March to be
flying without cargo netting properly in place.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical item in the FAA's report _ the operation of 17
Airbus planes without a required inspection of the skin around
their cargo doors _ was the result of a miscommunication,
Goodmanson said.
</P>
<P>
   After the inspections were completed this spring, the airline
found all 17 Airbuses in top shape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors viewed the incident differently, criticizing the
airline for initially arguing that the inspection did not have to
be done. This fueled the inspectors' belief that America West was
inattentive to maintenance duties. &QL; 
`NOBODY WATCHING STORE' &QL; 
Their complaints intensified after they realized that one of the
Airbuses flew an additional 185 times before being inspected for
cracks _ even after being notified by FAA investigators this April
that inspections had been missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is watching the store!'' an FAA inspector wrote in his
report on the Airbus inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that the FAA initially proposed an $11.2
million fine for 11 cases. The penalty could have been more, if the
FAA had added up the fines for an additional 24 outstanding cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd used up the maximum fine for all the violations, it
would have been $11 million to $15 million,'' said Monroe Balton,
deputy regional counsel for the FAA's Western Pacific division.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its settlement with America West, the FAA dropped its
investigation of an additional two dozen cases, some dating back to
the last decade and six as recent as this year. Most involved
security procedures, such as bags not being properly monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Balton said fines generally are a matter of ``prosecutorial
discretion.'' &QL;

HERNANDEZ PUTS HOLD ON TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right on cue, Rangers public address
announcer Chuck Morgan played the theme to ``The X-Files'' as
reliever Xavier Hernandez emerged from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Clever idea. ``X-Files''. X-man.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, though, is somewhat out of place. There's nothing
mysterious or otherworldly about Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers defeated the Tigers, 8-6, last night at The Ballpark
in Arlington because Hernandez simply made the pitches in the most
important part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out in the
seventh inning with the Rangers holding a two-run lead, and allowed
just one of the runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-man came in and did a fantastic job for us, and I felt that
was the key,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``To get out of that with
the guys he had to face there, that's a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez didn't figure into the decision. Starter Esteban
Loaiza (2-3) got the victory that moved the Rangers to within three
games of the Anaheim Angels in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't earn the save. That went to John Wetteland, who worked
the ninth for No. 36.
</P>
<P>
   He probably didn't appear on the ESPN highlights. Those belonged
to Juan Gonzalez, who drove in four runs with a two-run double in
the first off Tigers starter Bryce Florie (6-8), a run-scoring
double in the second and a single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But without Hernandez, there likely wouldn't have been a victory
for Loaiza or a save for Wetteland, and Gonzalez's heroics would be
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The theme song sounded when Hernandez entered the game in the
seventh with the heart of the Tigers' batting order due up.
</P>
<P>
   First was Damion Easley, second on the team with 81 runs batted
in. He popped out to second baseman Mark McLemore on what Hernandez
called a fastball down the middle, a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Tony Clark, Detroit's leader with 27 homers and 82 RBI.
He hit a weak grounder to first baseman Will Clark, although it
scored a run. Hernandez threw six consecutive forkballs, the last
on a 3-2 count even though Clark took the previous two for balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to throw him a fastball and have him pop it out
of the ballpark,'' Hernandez said. ``I figure he saw the ducks on
and wanted to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez intentionally walked Luis Gonzalez, and got out of the
inning when Juan Encarnacion lined out to shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed reliever then worked a 1-2-3 eighth before
yielding to Wetteland in the ninth. Wetteland retired all three
batters he faced, but he knew who the real hero was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any bases-loaded situation with no outs is pretty much the
ballgame,'' Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has allowed one earned run in his last 13
appearances and has a 1.41 ERA in his last 25 games, did it by
staying calm and throwing strikes, even if they weren't perfect
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think he's playing catch with his son in the back yard,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing mysterious about it, but it's a concept the
Rangers sometimes find hard to grasp. Good pitching, with a helping
of good defense, equals victories.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's game was headed in the direction of being one of
those where the formula falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz led off the seventh with a one-hopper to third
baseman Todd Zeile, who dropped it for an error. Tim Crabtree then
walked Brian Hunter, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez threw the ball away
on a pickoff attempt to put runners at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Eric Gunderson came in to face Frank Catalanotto, but
hit him with a 1-2 pitch to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it looked like another of those ``pitching and
defense let Rangers down'' games, Hernandez bailed out his team.

ANGELS NEARLY SWEEP DOUBLEHEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If ever a split felt like a sweep, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the New York Yankees 6-4 in the first game of
Wednesday's day-night doubleheader at Yankee Stadium, the Anaheim
Angels pulled off an incredible rally in the late innings of the
second game only to lose 7-6 on Derek Jeter's RBI single off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With the split and Texas' victory over Detroit, the Angels' lead
in the AL West was reduced to three games.
</P>
<P>
   Though the second-game loss ended the Angels' winning streak at
five games, winning game one gave them the first three of the
five-game set. Having won six of 10 against the Yankees with only
one more to play, the Angels have clinched the season series.
</P>
<P>
   The second-game loss allowed the Yankees to end a season-worst
losing streak of four games, but Angels manager Terry Collins was
impressed with his club even in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet there's consolation,'' Collins said. ``That's a
tremendous effort. They battled their butts off against a guy like
(Yankees starter) David Wells. There's nothing to be ashamed about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like (Yankees manager) Joe (Torre) said the other day, the
Yankees don't like losing. They come at you as hard as they can,
and we took 'em down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels trailed in the second game, 5-1 and 6-3, but refused
to quit. The Angels scored two in the seventh inning on Jim
Edmonds' second homer of the game, added two more in the eighth,
but trailed 6-5 in the ninth against Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and nobody on, Paco Martin singled. Darin Erstad
fell behind in the count 0-2 but fouled off five pitches with two
strikes and worked the count full.
</P>
<P>
   Martin broke for second on a 3-2 pitch and Erstad lined the ball
into the right-field corner. Martin beat the relay with a
head-first slide and the Angels dugout erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in and won the first three games and could easily have
said `Let's conserve energy for tomorrow, we've got Chuck (Finley)
tomorrow,''' Collins said. ``But they said `Let's come back and get
the game.' In the fifth inning, they were saying `We're right where
we want to be _ four runs down.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We can leave the ballpark tonight feeling great, with our
heads held high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera (3-0) got the win over Mike Fetters (2-7).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fell behind early. Angels starter Steve Sparks had
won five decisions in a row and sailed through 41/3 innings. But
after the knuckeballer struck out Darryl Strawberry to start the
fifth, the Yankees put together five consecutive hits, including a
three-run home run by Homer Bush, and scored five runs in the
inning. It was Bush's first career major-league homer.
</P>
<P>
   Just the prospect of playing the Yankees in a five-game series _
in New York _ seemed like a daunting task. But the Angels have been
up to the challenge by winning three of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the battle is not to be intimidated by them,'' shortstop
Gary DiSarcina said. ``They smell blood, they can crush you. As a
team, we understand we have to play this kind of baseball to
compete against the best teams. We understand as a group, a unit,
that's how you go about your business.''
</P>
<P>
   However, DiSarcina seemed perturbed at the surprise many have
expressed regarding the Angels' success against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can categorize it as special when you take the
season series from the team of the century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how pretty much all you hear about is how the
Yankees are not doing the job, their bullpen is struggling, they're
hitting a tough time,'' DiSarcina added. ``But we're playing good
baseball. It seems like we're playing in the shadows. But sometimes
that's good to put the focus on the other team. We give ourselves
credit. I've never been on a team that battles like this one, that
doesn't give a damn what the score is. It's something to be proud
of.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the first two games of the series, the Angels
fell behind in the first game Wednesday. And as in the first two
games of the series, they came back.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jeff Juden struggled with his command in the
early innings, walking four, allowing a solo homer to Tino Martinez
and an RBI double to Paul O'Neill as the Yankees took a 2-0 lead.
But Juden (1-2) settled down after that, allowing the Angels
offense a chance to figure out Yankees starter Ryan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina doubled home Edmonds with two outs in the fifth to
score the Angels' first run, and Reggie Williams followed with a
two-run homer for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began the sixth with three consecutive hits for two
more runs and knocked Bradley (1-1) out of the game.

ABUSIVE CULTURE LED TO YOUTH'S DEATH, INVESTIGATORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
 The number of wounds on the body of the teenage delinquent is a
matter of cold medical fact from the pages of an autopsy: 71. Blunt
force injuries. Bruises, cuts and abrasions from head to toe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Boys Ranch employees maintain that it was five fired
Ranch employees _ and several who were suspended _ whose violations
of Ranch policies helped put Nicholaus Contreraz in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But state investigators after three months of probing say 17
employees contributed to his death through neglect, abuse or simply
turning a blind eye to the actions of others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boys Ranch officials Wednesday vowed to fight the findings of
the Department of Economic Security's newest report, which rejects
their claim that the California youth's death March 2 was a result
of isolated incidents and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Calling the death ``regrettable and tragic,'' Ranch officials
said that they had conducted their own review which resulted in ``a
number of decisive and ongoing remedial actions'' that included
suspensions and firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon learning of policy viola tions by staff, ABR accepted re
sponsibility for actions, apologized and promptly began instituting
cor rective action,'' a prepared statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet state investigators say it was an abusive culture that led
to Contreraz's death and left other residents of the home for
troubled youths captive to routine mistreat ment or injury. State
officials, who also announced Wednesday an effort to deny renewal
of Boys Ranch operating license, said those prob lems continued
unabated even after Contreraz died and investigations began.
</P>
<P>
   The DES findings echo those of a California Department of Social
Services investigation that con cluded last month that youths were
being abused. California has halted funding for the placement of
delin quents there.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Woodward, Contreraz's grandmother, praised the decision
but said ``there's no closure, be cause there are still no arrests.
But it's a beginning, where we had nothing before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 former employees mentioned by DES, five were fired by
Boys Ranch for violating Ranch policies. One resigned and 11 others
have been laid off as the resident population has dwindled after
Con treraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and Julie Vega, Con treraz's mother, on Wednesday vis
ited the Sacramento cemetery where Contreraz is buried to deliver a
new Teddy Bear and ``to talk with Nick and let him know that we're
getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charges should have been filed the very day Nickie died,''
Wood ward said. ``This is not an isolated case. It's been going on
for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Contreraz was placed at the Ranch's Oracle facility January 5
by the Sacramento Juvenile Probation Department after a series of
per sonal problems that intensified when his father was murdered in
a drive-by shooting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He had a delinquency record that included shoplifting and
attempted robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months into his stay in Arizona, Contreraz died after
days of severe illness that went largely untreated even though he
continu ally complained of feeling ill.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed that he died from complications of empyema
of the left chest. He couldn't breathe because, as medical
examiners later found, there were 2.5 quarts of pus between the
lung and the inside lining of his chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released Wednesday by Blessing add to the weight of
evidence indicating Contreraz was victimized before he died March
2.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he had ``approxi mately 70 blunt force injuries to
his body consisting of abrasions and contusions on his chest,
abdomen, back, shoulder, chin, knees, arm and head which were
inflicted from `assisted exercise' and `restrictive behavior
management' incidents,'' said a DES notice sent Wednesday to Boys
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The notice said Boys Ranch ``verbally abused, ridiculed and
humiliated him by forcing him to carry a bucket with his vomit and
clothes on which he had defecated, by periodically forcing his head
into the bucket to smell the vomit and defecation, by forcing him
to eat meals while seated on the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   The notice said staff ignored ``his cries for help and his
medical symptoms including his loss of appetite.'' The same
document said he was sometimes laughed at while vomiting, as staff
accused him of faking an illness to avoid tough physical exercise.
When he was unwilling or unable to perform the exercises, it said,
he forcibly made to do them by staffers.
</P>
<P>
   As his condition worsened, Con treraz talked of wanting to die,
according to a Child Protective Services investigative report. His
comments fell on deaf ears, other documents show.
</P>
<P>
   A day-by-day and hour-by-hour reconstruction by CPS of his last
weeks alive paint a chilling picture of a boy isolated by staffers,
jeered as a laggard and punished because they thought he was
pretending to be sick. Names of Boys Ranch employees were blacked
out in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before his death, for example, he defecated on
himself and vomited. He was suspected of forcing himself to vomit,
and was told that he ``needed to follow instructions, stop
defecating on him self and accept responsibility for his actions.''
Those conclusions were drawn despite repeated previous visits to
the nurse for medical treatment of a variety of symptoms such as
difficulty breathing, fever, aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Later the same night, he was forced to do exercises and again
defecated on himself and said he felt like vomiting. He was ``given
the opportunity to shower and clean up and physical training
resumed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before his death, Contreraz was unable to eat break
fast and was too weak to do morning exercises. He collapsed after
being ordered to run up and down a hill. A few hours later, he
again fainted while walking to the chapel. Staffers rolled him to
the chapel in a wheel barrow. On his way there, he could be heard
saying, ``Lord help me, I need help, I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, he was barely able to keep his eyes open and
again was unable to eat. Before lunch, he was unable to run so
staffers ``attempted to have the victim run by dragging him while
holding him under his arms.'' He was seen carrying a yellow bucket
in which he had been told to vomit or defecate. ``He was being
marched, was sweaty and his pants kept falling.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunch that day, kitchen staff was told to serve Contreraz the
bare minimum of food. By late after noon, staff was again trying to
force him to exercise and chided him for ``putting forth minimal
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was isolated following this and a discussion took place in
which the victim was informed if he did not perform the exercises
he would be physically assisted,'' the CPS report states. He was
told to do push-ups, but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   He again defecated on himself, then became belligerent as staff
tried to force him to stand and clean himself up. He was carried to
a barracks and forcibly showered and dressed by Ranch workers. Then
he was told to carry his soiled clothes to a dumpster. He collapsed
on the way. A staffer told him he deserved an Academy Award for his
perform ance.
</P>
<P>
   More exercise was forced on Contreraz, with staff lifting him
and dropping him to the ground for push-ups. Growing yet weaker,
Con treraz's inability to perform as ordered garnered more
punishment until he was finally pushed against a wall and yelled
at. An employee sleeping 60 to 75 feet from the wall was awakened
up by the noise of banging on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, upon being told to do more push-ups, Contreraz lay on
his side in the sand and asked for water. He was told to stand, but
refused, so staffers carried him by his wrists and ankles to a
barracks. A worker went to get water.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, Contreraz was ``unresponsive.'' Staffers threw
wa ter on his face but failed to revive him. He had no pulse.
Staffers began CPR.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes later, he was officially pronounced dead at a
local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Boys Ranch was found to have repeatedly violated five
state regulations in its treatment of Con treraz. While DES has no
authority to take action against any of the individual former
employees cited in its re ports, it believes it can substantiate
allegations of abuse, neglect and bodily injury against former
Ranch employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinal County Attorney is investigating the former employees'
conduct. County attorney's spokes man Charles Ratliff said the
agency is investigating allegations dating to 1994 and that a
decision on whether to charge former employees would could be made
within several weeks. &QL;

U.S. WEAPONS INSPECTOR IN IRAQ RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs 1st graf to make it read: The longest-serving, etc.) (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longest-serving U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq resigned
Wednesday, charging that the U.N. secretary-general, the Security
Council and the Clinton administration had stymied the inspectors
on ``the doorstep'' of uncovering Iraq's hidden weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector, Scott Ritter, said in his resignation letter that
the failure to push aggressively ahead with the inspections was ``a
surrender to Iraqi leadership'' that made a ``farce'' of the
commission's efforts to prove that Iraq was concealing chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter asserted that the lack of will stemmed from a policy
shift by the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general that
was backed ``at least implicitly by the United States.'' He made
his resignation letter public in an effort to force the United
States and the United Nations to return to a tougher stance.
</P>
<P>
   The administration heatedly denied Ritter's conclusions, saying
it had faithfully backed the inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official insisted that the United States was
``keeping up the pressure on Iraq in ways that really affect him.''
Within the last week, for instance, the United States and its
allies have quietly moved ships into waters near Iraq to keep
President Saddam Hussein from smuggling out oil by sea.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, said he
``does nothing at the behest of Iraq.'' Richard Butler, chairman of
the inspection team, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ritter asserted that the administration had
been secretly trying since late last year to find a diplomatic
solution for its confrontation with Saddam and in doing so had
abandoned a policy _ in effect since the end of the Persian Gulf
war in 1991 _ to use sanctions and the threat of military force to
compel the Iraqi leader's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has publicly backed the inspectors, who have
insisted on full and unfettered access to sites in Iraqi suspected
of being used to conceal weapons or the expertise needed to make
them. Twice in the last year the United States has threatened
military action against Iraq for obstructing the inspections, and
in February, U.S. warships were moved within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, U.S. officials acknowledged that the United
States and Britain had privately urged Butler to stop trying to
hold surprise inspections of sites in Baghdad. The officials said
they wanted to avoid an open confrontation with Iraq after Hussein
said he would no longer cooperate with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms
control at all,'' Ritter wrote Wednesday. ``What is being
propagated by the Security Council today is such an illusion, one
which in all good faith I cannot, and will not, be a party to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, joined the
commission in September 1991, soon after its creation, and was
assigned to help the inspectors ferret out whether Iraq was hiding
information and material relating to its programs to build weapons
of mass destruction, and if so, how.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis moved to block many of the inspections led by him and
accused Ritter of being a U.S. intelligence officer, a charge
Washington emphatically denied.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that the ``beginning of a slow death'' for the
inspection team began in earnest last October after Iraq blocked
inspectors and provoked a crisis that led Clinton administration
officials to predict that military action would be necessary if
Iraq did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said administration officials told the inspectors then
that ``there was not enough military power in the region'' to
provoke a confrontation with Iraq, even though the inspectors had
``indisputable proof'' that the effort to hide information relating
to Iraq's weapons programs was ``run by the presidency of Iraq and
protected by the presidential security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration repeated its assessment in late November, he
said, warning the inspectors again not to conduct more inspections
aimed at revealing how Iraq was concealing the information _ what
Ritter called ``concealment inspections.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ritter said, administration officials told the
inspectors that military action over the Christmas holidays was
``domestically unsustainable,'' meaning it would be politically
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to discuss which administration officials gave
him and the other inspectors this advice.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defuse the crisis in February, Annan and Saddam
signed an agreement establishing new rules for the inspections.
Ritter said that while he and other inspection officials were
deeply worried about the agreement's impact, he decided not to
resign, but rather to test Iraq's willingness to comply with the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He was encouraged, he added, by the fact that the Security
Council warned Iraq of ``severest consequences'' if it blocked the
inspectors _ language that suggested the United States might carry
out military strikes on Iraq if Baghdad reneged on its word.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, in fact, returned to lead a controversial inspection in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Ritter said, the Clinton administration decided
that it would no longer support intrusive inspections solely for
the purpose of gaining access to sensitive sites, inspections that
Ritter characterized as crucial to the inspectors' mission.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings at the State Department and the Pentagon, he said,
he sensed a lack of support for what he called ``concealment
inspections,'' and felt that such inspections were becoming in the
administration's view a ``political liability'' in the
administration's view.
</P>
<P>
   In July the inspectors received what Ritter called ``two of the
best pieces of intelligence information we've had in a long time''
about Iraqi weapons activities. Ritter declined to disclose the
nature of the information. But he said he advised Butler, the
chairman of the inspection team, that the time had come to act, and
that Butler agreed.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritter refused to discuss the nature or target of the
inspections that he claimed the administration helped stop, he said
they were aimed at one of Saddam Hussein's principal secretaries,
Abed Hamid Mahmud, who he said is responsible for orchestrating
Iraq's effort to conceal information and material, and at the
Special Security Organization, which carries out Mahmud's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said he had gone to London to ask the British government
to supply personnel and material for the inspection. He said Derek
Plumbly, the director of the British Foreign Office's Middle East
command, was enthusiastic about the inspection and agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after consultations with Washington, he added,
Plumbly changed his mind. Ritter accused the administration of what
he called a ``cowardly act,'' namely, putting pressure on the
British not to cooperate with the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter would not identify the administration officials he says
put pressure on London. On Wednesday night, the administration
heatedly denied that any such pressure had been exerted and
repeated a denial earlier this month that it had softened its
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, said a spokesman for the National Security
Council, ``regrets Ritter's resignation and has the highest regard
for Ritter and his work.'' But the spokesman added, ``Any
suggestion that senior administration officials had conversations
with the Brits about canceling inspections is a total
fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CBS News reported Wednesday night that Ritter is
being investigated by the FBI for reportedly sharing classified
intelligence with Israel. Ritter could not be reached for comment.
But an inspection official, while not confirming such an
investigation, said, ``Scott Ritter is on very firm ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter had even harsher criticism of Annan. In his letter, he
accused Annan of becoming ``a sounding board for Iraqi grievances,
real or imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for the secretary-general, said
Wednesday night that Annan, who is in Ghana, had not yet seen the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ritter's charges that Annan had become a ``sounding
board'' for Iraqi grievances, Eckhard replied, ``That's really part
of his job description, to listen to the complaints of member
states.''

OPERATOR OF CHARITY FACES CHARGES OF ABUSING HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In classified ads, Renae Ferguson made an
irresistible plea for donations of horses to help her
needy-children's camps.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of equestrians in Southern California answered by
donating their beloved pets, but their charity took a horrific turn
Wednesday when Ferguson, 28, of suburban Tarzana was arraigned in
Los Angeles Municipal Court on misdemeanor charges of cruelty to
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson did not run a children's riding camp, police said. She
starved and abused the horses while waiting to find buyers for them
_ and investigators believe at least one was sold to a
slaughterhouse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it just pull at your heartstrings?'' said Richard
Felosky, a district supervisor for the city's Animal Regulation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone gives up their pet they've had for umpteen years,
their beloved horse, doesn't want to send it to the meat factory.
What better than to give it to needy children?''
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts are unknown for all but 14 horses that officials
impounded and sent to Valley animal shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson and both her parents were jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson also could be charged with felony fraud, said police
Detective Rene Lacasse.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's father, John Reddeck, 56, was arraigned with Ferguson
on cruelty to animals charges Wednesday, said police Detective John
Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   In the courthouse at Reddeck and Ferguson's arraignment
Wednesday, Ferguson's mother, Darlene Craig, 48, was arrested on
suspicion of cruelty to animals, police said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ferguson is accused of following the same practice for years
elsewhere, police said. She is scheduled to stand trial on a charge
of cruelty to animals in neighboring Ventura County on Sept. 2. No
fraud has been alleged in that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling it's all up and down the state,'' said
Cathleen Doyle of the California Equine Council.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lacasse, the parents, who are divorced, served as a
front for their daughter's illegal horse trading, fielding
complaints from animal advocates and neighbors concerned for the
health of the starving horses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ferguson's horses found at stables in suburban Sylmar
and La Tuna Canyon were emaciated, others had a hoof condition
called thrush from living in filthy conditions, said Felosky.
Acting on complaints from horse owners, Felosky spearheaded the
effort to save the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Damato rented stables in Sylmar, 23 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, to Ferguson in the spring, but then lodged a
complaint with authorities after three months. Ferguson had claimed
her horses were abused at their previous stable, but Damato grew
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Those horses could hardly walk, Damato said. ``They were skin
and bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's alleged scheme began with advertisements in the
Recycler and California Horse Trader newspapers. The ads solicited
donations of horses, tack, wagons and trailers for her West Coast
Riding Academy for needy children. The academy was advertised as a
certified nonprofit. Police said it is not a certified nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson then sold the donated horses through ads in the same
publications.
</P>
<P>
   With her ads Ferguson secured donations of hundreds of horses,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said she turned those horses around sometimes in
one day and sometimes for as much as $2,500. Sometimes it took long
enough that she nearly starved the animals to death, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said she later explained the animals' condition to
potential buyers by saying the animals had been brought to the camp
in a starved condition, and she couldn't afford to nurse them back
to health.

YANKEES SPLIT DOUBLE-HEADER WITH ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A long day and a long night of baseball had a chance
to be a lost day and lost night for the New York Yankees. They
looked like a mortal team for a week and looked even worse against
the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the finest record in the major leagues desperately
needed to win on Wednesday. For their sanity, for their confidence
and for halting an irksome losing streak. But they lost the first
game of the day-night doubleheader, 6-4, and then Mariano Rivera
mishandled a save chance in the second game that enabled the Angels
to tie the score in the ninth inning. It was happening again.
</P>
<P>
   So when Derek Jeter batted against Shigetoshi Hasegawa with two
outs and with Jorge Posada on third in the bottom of the ninth, he
was staring at an opportunity to be a savior.
</P>
<P>
   To save the Yankees from possibly being swept, to save the
Yankees from being hexed by the Angels and to save Rivera on a
night when the closer was not impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter did all of the above. Jeter squirted a single past a
diving Darrin Erstad at first base on a 3-2 fastball to score
Posada and catapult the Yankees to a dramatic 7-6 triumph that
terminated their four-game losing streak and caused Joe Torre to
sigh so loudly in his office that it could be heard 30 feet away in
the clubhouse. The manager was relieved and so were the Yankees
(95-36) after not frittering away a game they had once led by 5-1
behind a sloppy David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want anything to spiral,'' Torre said. ``Any time
you lose two, three, four games in a row, a little piece of your
confidence gets chopped off. It was a big win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Very big. It took almost five months to happen, but the
record-chasing Yankees performed like an ordinary team in dropping
six of eight games before Jeter's crucial hit. The Angels, who have
now stopped them in 6 of the 10 games between the two teams, had
handled them better than any team in the American League. But Jeter
insisted that he was not thinking about Anaheim's dominance. He was
thinking about making the last out during the last two losses to
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to like those situations,'' Jeter said. ``I like those
situations. Sometimes you're going to fail and sometimes you're
going to succeed. It was one of the situations that are fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush clubbed a three-run homer, the first of his career,
to spark a five-run fifth against Steve Sparks and give the Yankees
confidence and a 5-1 lead. After Jim Edmonds ripped the second of
his two homers off Wells to make it Scott Brosius scored on Mike
Fetter's costly throwing error to make it 6-3. But the Angels
nicked Wells for a run in the eighth on Tim Salmon's single and
scored another after Rivera replaced Wells to make it 6-5. Wells
yielded five earned runs in seven innings and failed to record his
career-best 17th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, that's all that matters,'' Wells said. ``I
wasn't pleased with my performance because we could have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera recorded the first two outs in the ninth before Norberto
Martin smacked a single to center field. The Yankees were still
confident. Or were they? Erstad engaged in a classic 11-pitch
at-bat with Rivera that ended with him stroking a 3-2 pitch to
right field. Since Martin was running on the pitch, he managed to
score on the single as Posada failed to properly block the plate
and Martin dived across head first. The Yanks were stunned as
Rivera botched only his fifth save in 38 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called on him to do a little more than he normally does,''
said Torre, referring to Rivera's attempt to notch a two-inning
save for only the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees emerged with their 95th victory as Posada walked
to initiate the ninth, advanced to second on Scott Brosius's
sacrifice bunt and smartly scooted to third on Bush's roller up the
third-base line. Even though Jeter had the game-winning hit, Bush
had as many reporters around his locker because of his important
homer. He has spoken to the fan who has the baseball and plans to
make a deal to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man wants a bat, but I'm probably going to get him a
Derek Jeter or Bernie Williams bat to make it really worth his
while,'' Bush said modestly and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were not smiling after losing the opener. Ryan
Bradley started the game because Ramiro Mendoza had a cyst removed
from his buttocks, and the 22-year-old rookie cruised for the first
four innings and had a 2-0 bulge. But the Angels scored three in
the fifth on Gary DiSarcina's two-out double and Reggie Williams's
first major league homer, a two-run shot, and scored three more in
the sixth to end Bradley's first major league start in untidy
fashion. Bradley, who gave up five earned runs and whiffed eight in
five innings, was optioned to Class AAA Columbus after the game as
the Yanks recalled Jay Tessmer, a reliever and a fresh arm, from
Columbus. The loss to the hardly imposing Jeff Juden and the
post-game queries caused Torre to realize the perception of his
team had changed, even if it is only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, all of a sudden, the questions aren't about who we're
going to play in the World Series,'' Torre said. ``Now we're
concerned about getting there. It's funny what a week does.
W-e-a-k, weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's locker was empty by the time Bush, a 25-year-old
rookie, and Jeter, a 24-year-old who was the rookie of the year in
1996, helped the Yankees exhale deeply and win the second game.
Things changed a little for the Yankees in the last week. They have
enjoyed such a superb season that everyone has expected storybook
endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still human,'' Mike Stanton said. ``There's still only
one who walked on water who wasn't.''

MCGUIRE HITS 54TH AFTER SOSA BLASTS 52ND 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It seems that Mark McGwire is deliciously enjoying
making mini-dramas out of his pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season
home run record. Just as it appears that Sammy Sosa of the Cubs is
nipping at his home run heels, McGwire belts yet another.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario, followed several times now in the last few weeks,
saw Sosa hit a home run on Wednesday afternoon in Cincinnati for
his 52nd of the season, one behind McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware that Sammy had hit another home run,'' McGwire
said after his game. ``The television was on in the clubhouse. It's
exciting. I get the feeling everybody in America is watching.
They're having fun. I'm trying to.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, not looking terrific at the plate in his first three
appearances against Florida on Wednesday night in Busch Stadium,
came to bat in the eighth inning with a teammate on third, none out
and the Cardinals leading, 1-0. He had previously hit two towering
fly outs to center field, and once he was called out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, facing Justin Speier, a right-hander for Florida, McGwire
swung and fouled off the first pitch. On the second, he hit it with
the sound and sight of a cannon shot, to dead center field. It
easily cleared the fence and landed 509 feet from home plate. It
was his 54th homer of the season, and placed him just eight short
of the Maris record. The Cardinals have 30 games left this season.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 30,004 stood and cheered, as has become its custom
for McGwire, and fireworks exploded in the night air. Of course, he
took his curtain call or the fans, standing, would not let the game
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of his home runs this season have been like that,
clutch homers,'' said Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager. ``He
gave us two more runs in a tight game.''
</P>
<P>
   With McGwire safely seated, Speier threw the very next pitch at
the chin of the next batter, Brian Jordan. It brought a warning
from the plate umpire Harry Wendelstedt. Jim Leyland, the Marlins'
manager, rushed out to argue, and Wendelstedt ejected him from the
game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire becomes just the third National League player to reach
54 homers in a season, and the first since 1949, when Ralph Kiner
hit that many.
</P>
<P>
   There have been only nine players (including McGwire in 1997,
with 58) to have hit 54 home runs. Babe Ruth (four times) is the
only player to have done it more than once.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 53rd home run came two games ago, against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   His records are piling up. In the last couple of weeks he broke
his own major league record for home runs (111) by a right-handed
batter in consecutive seasons, and he set a major league record
with 162 homers in three straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night he was on pace to hit 66 homers this
season, and he has raised that projection yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the game grow increasingly exciting in regard to
the home-run chase, but the game itself took on a strange tone as
the Cardinals scored three more runs after McGwire's two-run shot,
giving them a 6-0 lead. Then the Marlins came back with six runs in
the top of the ninth _ three of them against John Frescatore, who
was booed until he was removed from the game without getting anyone
out. The cheers for his removal by his home-town crowd were not
quite as great as those for McGwire's heroics, but they were
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals proceeded to squander their lead, allowing the
Marlins to tie the game in the ninth. The Marlins scored once in
the top of the 10th. McGwire led off the bottom of the inning with
a single, but the Marlins shut the Cardinals down and Florida won
by 7-6. The Cards were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said McGwire after the game, ``I can't enjoy the home
run. My first concern is as a baseball player for the Cardinals. I
know America is not watching the Cardinals, but watching me. I can
understand that, but I'm only one player on this team trying to
help it win.'' With the loss, the Cardinals are now 62-70. ``Our
team goal is to finish the season at .500,'' McGwire said.

KID'S GREAT CATCH SPOILED BY THIEVING JERK

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It should have been the kid's proudest moment. The
kind you take to bed with you and dream about over and over again
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The catch. The glorious catch.
</P>
<P>
   A long foul ball hit by one of the Atlanta Braves during batting
practice at Dodger Stadium a few weeks ago, hurtling toward you
like it has your name written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of adults, teen-agers and small kids jockeying for
position along the foul line to make the catch, but the ball seems
to have eyes only for you.
</P>
<P>
   It flies by all the outstretched hands and lands smack-dab in
the middle of your glove. Ken Griffey Jr. never made a better
pressure catch.
</P>
<P>
   Your mom, who has been watching the whole scene from her seat,
jumps up and starts to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great catch, Travis!'' Lisa Martin yells. ``Great catch,
son!''
</P>
<P>
   And you stand there beaming, like only a 12-year-old kid in love
with baseball can beam _ trying to pick your mom out of the crowd,
anxious to show her the ball you just caught at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   DODGER STADIUM! Not the neighborhood Little League or Pony
League field. Not the school yard or back yard. DODGER STADIUM!
</P>
<P>
   Your mom sees it first; then you feel it. The hand. The hand of
an adult reaching into your glove and yanking out the ball.
</P>
<P>
   You look up and see this big guy standing there smiling and
holding the ball up like he caught it, when he didn't. You did. But
you're only a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, mister, that's my ball!'' you yell at him. ``I caught it
in my glove!''
</P>
<P>
   The guy looks at you and shrugs his shoulders. Tough luck, kid,
the look in his eyes says. You can't do anything about it. You're
only a kid.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't see it, son, but your mom was sitting there stunned
at what she was witnessing, trying to figure out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, she's standing there down by the foul
pole yelling something to you. What is it she's saying? You strain
to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, buddy, great catch!'' Lisa yells. ``I'm proud of you! I
saw you catch that ball!''
</P>
<P>
   And then turning and looking directly at the guy holding your
baseball, your mom yells out: ``Don't worry, son! The jerk who took
it from you will have to go home tonight and try to get to sleep
knowing he stole a baseball from a little boy!''
</P>
<P>
   The guy just looked at her and shrugged his shoulders again. The
best retort the jerk could come up with _ a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the game, and a good game it was. But Travis just
wasn't himself,'' Lisa said. `` `Disappointed' sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a big night for the kid.
</P>
<P>
   This game, these tickets, were a present from his mom for
graduating from sixth grade at his Simi Valley school in
neighboring Ventura County with good grades. He's been waiting for
this night for months.
</P>
<P>
   And along comes some jerk to steal his ball, his moment. When
his head hit the pillow later, the kid wouldn't be dreaming about
the catch _ he'd be dreaming about the jerk who stole the ball
right out of his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The kid took one more shot at salvaging the night, standing
vigil after the game by the fence where the Dodgers come out to
their cars _ hoping a few of them would sign the Dodger trading
cards he had in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the smaller kids were no match for the bigger jerks
who waited by the same fence when Dodger players Matt Luke, Eric
Karros and Eric Young stopped to sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Travis almost got close enough to get Young's signature on a
card, but the crush of people was just too much.
</P>
<P>
   One good push was all it took, Lisa says, and Young's trading
card flew out of her son's hand and landed on the ground, trampled
by dozens of feet.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a Dodger security guard retrieved the card on the
other side of the fence for the kid, Young was already in his car,
trying to get by a crush of older teens blocking his way out of the
parking lot _ almost demanding that he stop to sign more
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa had seen enough. ``Let's go,'' she finally said to her son,
telling him it was this kind of fan behavior that was the reason
more Dodger players didn't stop after a game to sign autographs _
the reason they needed security guards walking them to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled up in her son's eyes, and he was angry as they
walked to their own car, Lisa says. Not at the Dodgers, who were
great, but at the adult bully who took his ball.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Dodgers and other ballclubs should think about having
a reserved section during batting practice strictly for kids
bringing their gloves to the park to catch fly balls _ no adults or
older teen-agers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, remember this, kid: The jerk stole your ball,
but he didn't steal the truth.
</P>
<P>
   You made the catch, kid. And a great catch it was.

DES CITES YOUTH'S DEATH, OTHER INCIDENTS IN DENYING LICENSE TO BOYS
RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of 16-year-old Nicholaus Contreraz last spring was
part of ``a pattern of abuse and neglect'' at Arizona Boys Ranch
that led to at least 29 other reported incidents, state officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Blessing, director of the state Department of Economic
Security, said some of the mistreatment occurred even as
authorities swarmed over the Ranch to investigate Contreraz's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing announced Wednesday that she has denied Boys Ranch a
new license based on an exhaustive investigation that uncovered
multiple violations of state law and rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thomas, president of Boys Ranch, said he has not had a
chance to review the reports, but he has no intention of closing
down an institution that operates campuses statewide and has worked
with delinquent youths for 49 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will appeal,'' Thomas vowed. ``We are not going to let
these kids down. . . . We plan on going forward. Boys Ranch has
been in business for almost a half-century. We've served thousands
of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessing's announcement came five months after Contreraz
succumbed while being punished at a Boys Ranch boot camp in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   DES specialists concluded that 17 Boys Ranch employees,
including some supervisors, were culpable for 32 instances of abuse
or neglect involving Contreraz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The egregious nature of these violations make our decision
clear,'' Blessing said. ``The death of any child is tragic, and
Nicholaus' death was especially so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances surrounding his death, and the repeated
treatment of other residents, demonstrate a pattern of abuse and
neglect by Arizona Boys Ranch, and a lack of concern by senior
management and line staff for the rights of youth placed in their
care and custody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the allegations are contained in about 4,000 pages of
documentation released Wednesday by the Licensing and Child
Protective Services branches of DES.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing emphasized that Boys Ranch has a right to appeal, and
it can remain open while the case is pending. However, she made it
clear that the organization's future hinges on revised policy and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a change in the organization's culture,'' she
said. &QL; 
`THEY'RE SURROUNDED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boys Ranch seems so mired in legal, financial and
publicity problems that, as one state official put it, ``They're
surrounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Pinal County Attorney's Office are conducting
criminal evaluations in connection with Contreraz's death and other
abuse complaints. Charges could be lodged not only against
staffers, but against management and the non-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch's license expires Sept. 15, and operations could be
shut down as early as October if appeals fail.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz's family has retained an attorney and is expected to
file a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   California, which provided about three-quarters of the
placements at Boys Ranch, has cut off funding and individual
counties have withdrawn nearly all of those juveniles. Other states
also have pulled back placements.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Boys Ranch residents are placed by juvenile
courts and probation departments. But now enrollment has dwindled
from nearly 600 youths at seven locations to 150 boys staying at
the main campus in Queen Creek and a summer camp on Mount Lemmon
near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Each lost youth represents about $3,600 per month, and Thomas
said 60 of the remaining boys are on scholarship because government
agencies won't fund them.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Boys Ranch, with an annual budget of $26.5
million, depends on that income _ and faces a financial crunch.
Already, Boys Ranch has reduced staffing from about 350 employees
to 70.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thomas said the private, non-profit organization will
scrimp, cut salaries and seek donations to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not rich, but we're going to beg, borrow and steal to
keep this program going,'' he added. ``No, we can't do it
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he still hopes to work in cooperation with DES to
``make this a win/win situation for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But he disputed Blessing's contention that there is a pattern of
abuse at Boys Ranch, and said he has no intention of leaving, or of
making any other leadership changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all plan to be here,'' said Thomas, who has directed Boys
Ranch since 1976. ``My management team has been here for a lot of
years.'' &QL; 
RANCH'S CHECKERED HISTORY &QL; 
Boys Ranch's history is checkered with allegations that juveniles
have been mistreated. The complaints, and feuds with state
regulators, stem in part from of the organization's hands-on method
of dealing with belligerent teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   At least three previous state investigations resulted in
allegations of serious abuse. Two years ago, DES employees wrote a
rebellious letter to their boss after Boys Ranch's license was
renewed, complaining that the program was ``a severe risk to
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such criticism, Thomas and Boys Ranch typically
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1994 DES report ripped Boys Ranch for punching, choking
and otherwise assaulting kids, an investigative team led by former
U.S. Attorney A. Melvin McDonald was paid $400,000 to investigate
the investigators. McDonald concluded that abuse claims were bogus
_ the product of biased investigators and manipulative boys.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch sued DES. It sued ``The Arizona Republic'' for a news
report on a juvenile who drowned during an escape attempt. And it
sued a University of Illinois professor who wrote that ranch
managers ``condoned or ignored a pattern of violence.'' The suit
against ``The Republic'' is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing and other DES employees emphasized Wednesday that every
allegation in the Contreraz case was substantiated by Boys Ranch
workers and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Based on more than 50 interviews of Boys Ranch employees, she
concluded that Ranch workers contributed to Contreraz's death. She
blamed not only medical neglect, but a practice of physically
``addressing'' juveniles and ``assisting'' them with work or
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   DES licensing inspectors found that Boys Ranch employees
repeatedly abused, threatened and taunted juveniles, and failed to
provide health care or to document injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the DES report indicates Boys Ranch refused to
cooperate with state licensing inspectors who sought records.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch's license was denied based on those incidents, a
history of violations and the organization's inability or
unwillingness to meet the needs of children, according to DES
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas complained that DES did not allow Boys Ranch to see the
findings or correct errors. When told about DES allegations that a
staffer had rubbed a boy's face in sheep manure, he said that
exemplifies flaws in DES reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy was totally out of control. He had three staffers
down,'' Thomas said. ``We did not rub his head in sheep manure. . .
. It comes to this: Who do you believe, the kids or the staff?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he intends to have professional investigators review
the findings, and McDonald already is working with him.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Boys Ranch is one of the best juvenile-treatment
programs in America. He noted that about 40 California juveniles,
who were withdrawn from the program after Contreraz's death,
voluntarily returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do that at Auschwitz,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boys Ranch still has a core of staunch supporters _
especially among graduates and their families.
</P>
<P>
   At the Queen Creek headquarters, staff members went about their
business Wednesday while groups of boys strolled from class to
class.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, a vanload of residents and a staffer drove to a
nearby convenience store to buy snacks. Reporters and photographers
were not allowed on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Creek Mayor Mark Schnepf said Contreraz's death was not
reason enough to close a program that has taught delinquents
respect for themselves and others for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many organizations that deal with troubled people have
tragedies, but when a tragedy occurs with the Sheriff's Office or
Child Protective Services, we don't talk about shutting those
agencies down. We talk about fixing the problems and making sure
the problem doesn't happen again,'' Schnepf said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' message to supporters: ``Keep the faith. This, too,
shall pass.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: ONE TINY STEP FOR JANET RENO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 27:
</P>
<P>
   With her decision to trigger a preliminary inquiry by Justice
Department investigators into Vice President Gore's telephone
solicitations, Attorney General Janet Reno has moved tardily and
incompletely toward appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate a small corner of White House fund-raising during the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   We would like to be able to salute her for a bolder embrace of
her obligation to uphold federal campaign laws and discharge an
attorney general's overarching duty to assure the integrity of
federal law and the nation's electoral system. That is not possible
given the narrow scope she has defined for the preliminary inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But we can at least praise her for making a start toward
conquering her now-legendary inertia and toward heeding warnings by
the government's top campaign finance investigators that she has
been misreading the law on campaign violations and her own conflict
of interest in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, making Gore the target of the new 90-day inquiry
that will determine whether the case gets referred to an outside
prosecutor will win headlines, and the uninformed may praise Reno
for political gumption. She is, after all, delivering a potential
blow to Gore's Presidential aspirations at a time when he has
literally put an ocean between himself and the Administration's
ever-blossoming scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the case against Gore look ominous. The new
inquiry will be asked to determine if he lied when he told Justice
Department investigators that he thought he was raising soft money,
or party-building funds, rather than hard money, or direct
contributions for campaign purposes. Some people who were in
planning meetings with Gore may have told investigators that the
vice president knew he was dialing for hard dollars, and one took
notes suggesting that hard money had been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever Gore did, his role was part of a much broader drama
of reckless and possibly illegal conduct planned and executed with
White House approval. Justice's former lead prosecutor, Charles La
Bella, has given Reno a report that is reliably said to argue that
the Democrats conducted a conspiracy to evade contribution and
spending limits by using soft money for candidate commercials
disguised as issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Fred Thompson has pointed out, the other vast area
requiring a prosecutor with no ties to Reno or President Clinton
has to do with illegal Asian contributions and the possible selling
of White House access and input on policy discussions in return for
contributions. There is also the more momentous question of whether
the FBI was right when it warned before the 1996 election that the
Chinese government wanted to funnel illegal contributions to
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   These questions feel elderly now because Reno has been aging
them like a Virginia ham. But their familiarity does not mean they
have been answered. Only a mind-reader could know why Reno thinks
Gore's telephone calls loom as a greater threat to the democratic
process than millions in illegal foreign contributions, misuse of
White House invitations, evasion of the Federal Election Campaign
Act and possible meddling by another nation in a presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Independent Counsel Act, if a prosecutor is appointed
he can seek approval from a special three-judge oversight panel to
expand his inquiry to related matters if he finds evidence of
additional wrongdoing. Based on information that has convinced the
FBI. director and other weighty Washington figures, there is plenty
to dig into, if only the attorney general would get all the way out
of the way.

EDITORIAL: MARK MCGUIRE'S PEP PILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 27:
</P>
<P>
   A dismaying little chill blew through the red-hot home-run race
between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa last weekend, when McGwire
admitted that for about a year he had been ingesting a substance
called androstenedione. The over-the-counter pill is classified by
the Food and Drug Administration as a nutritional supplement, and
is legal under Major League Baseball's drug rules. Even so, it is
banned by the National Football League and by the International
Olympic Committee, which recently suspended an American
shot-putter, Randy Barnes, for using it.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of people, this has tainted McGwire's otherwise
thrilling assault on Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home
runs, and some have even suggested, not entirely in jest, that if
McGwire beats the record he should have an asterisk next to his
name denoting that he did so under questionable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Our view is that this is an unproductive line of argument, not
so much because androstenedione is legal in baseball but because
even the experts who believe the substance could build muscle
strength also say there is no evidence that it improves the
eye-hand coordination required of every successful hitter. There is
also the problem of what to do with Sosa if he breaks the record.
Sosa takes creatine, as does McGwire. Creatine is an
over-the-counter amino acid, popular in many locker rooms, that is
also thought to build muscles. Does that mean we should also award
Sosa an asterisk, albeit a smaller one than McGwire's?
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty surrounds androstenedione's muscle-building powers,
largely because it has not been studied in any detail. In medical
terms, the substance is known as a ``precursor'' that the body
converts into testosterone. Elevated testosterone levels, in turn,
enable athletes to train harder and build more muscle. There is
little doubt that anabolic steroids, which are widely banned, cause
significant, performance-enhancing and potentially dangerous
increases in muscle mass and strength. But there is debate in the
medical and sports communities about whether androstenedione has
the same result, or whether, as some experts believe, it is simply
flushed from the system before it can significantly elevate
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   These uncertainties about androstenedione's impact on the body
are nevertheless cause for great concern _ especially now that
thousands of younger athletes may be tempted to dash to their local
drugstores and load up on the same stuff that McGwire is ingesting.
The International Olympic Committee and the National Football
League have chosen to err on the safe side _ the IOC because it
believed that androstenedione could confer a competitive edge, and
the NFL because it thought the substance could lead to the same
health problems associated with anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   After days of ducking the issue, Major League Baseball's top
officials announced a study of nutritional supplements on
Wednesday. This is welcome news. But in view of the unanswered
questions about androstenedione, a first prudent step would be to
ask McGwire, and other players who use it, to take it off their
shelves immediately.

PINIELLA OUTBURST CAPS MARINERS' 71ST LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The most memorable moment of Wednesday's game
occurred just before Jeff Fassero's seventh complete game of the
season and sixth route-going defeat became official.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella stole the show one out from the finish of a 5-3
Seattle loss to the Cleveland Indians before 43,091 fans who
witnessed one of the most animated displays of Piniella's
managerial career.
</P>
<P>
   Already angry because Russ Davis had been called out by second
base umpire Larry Barnett for running out of the basepath between
first and second bases in the ninth inning, Piniella returned to
the dugout unaware that he had been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   When he found out, Piniella returned to the field and didn't go
nearly as quietly as he had in his first visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my money's worth the second time,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella threw his cap on the ground, kicked at it and missed,
argued some more and finally, on his way back to the dugout, kicked
the hat five more times. He then picked it up and tossed it into
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   A fan tossed it back.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jacobs Field sellout crowd roared again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone can find that many things to say,''
opposing manager Mike Hargrove said. ``It was a long (argument).''
</P>
<P>
   Long and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hat looks good, but I'm not in the mood for fun,'' said
Piniella after the Mariners' ninth loss in 10 games against the
Indians this season. ``I respect the umpires and realize they have
a tough job to do. But at the same time, I have to defend my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended Davis' right to elude a tag attempt by Indians
second baseman Enrique Wilson, who had fielded pinch-hitter Raul
Ibanez's grounder. Wilson missed Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it when (Barnett) told me I was out for
running out of the basepath,'' Davis said. ``It would have been
different if he had said I had been tagged, which I wasn't. I
didn't run out of the basepath, either. You could see my
footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella saw them. And tried to show Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran (Piniella) when he was pointing at the ground,'' Barnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I supposed to do, point at the sky?'' Piniella
countered. ``My baserunner was running on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' footprints showed that he never left the infield dirt and
the rule says a runner has a 6-foot (3 feet on each side of the
imaginary baseline) leeway to avoid a tag.
</P>
<P>
   Davis thought he was within that boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``I wasn't trying to show up the umpire. I was
just showing him the footprints. You can't even talk to (the
umpires) anymore without getting ejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero can't do enough to get a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander is winless since July 25 despite tossing three
complete games in his last six starts. He remains stuck on 10 wins,
to go with his 10 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been pitching awfully well without much run support,''
pitching coach Stan Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have scored 15 runs in Fassero's six complete-game
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' Fassero asked. ``I guess the only thing you
can do is have the lead in the eighth inning so we don't face the
other team's closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero had one-run leads in the second and third innings
Wednesday, but fell behind for good in the fifth when Manny Ramirez
continued his season-long assault on Seattle pitchers with a
two-run homer to left field, putting the Indians ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's 32nd homer of the season, and seventh against the
Mariners, came immediately after Fassero botched a potential
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and Kenny Lofton on first base, Omar Vizquel hit a
one-hopper back to Fassero. He clutched once and threw slightly
off-target to shorstop Alex Rodriguez, covering the base. The best
Rodriguez could do was come off the bag, make the catch and then
touch the base to force Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I double-clutched and then tried to make a perfect throw,''
Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tried to get a fastball in on Ramirez's hands. But the
ball got too much of the strike zone and the Indians right fielder
sent it high and deep.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Cleveland homer of the game. First baseman
Richie Sexson, subbing for injured Jim Thome, hit a one-out homer
in the second inning, the first of his career-high four hits. He
also doubled twice and singled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit every kind of pitch I throw,'' Fassero said. ``But all
of them were down (in the strike zone). I told Jamie (Moyer) to
pitch him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer starts Thursday's series finale.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Piniella was ejected for the third time this season. ...
Winning pitcher Dave Burba ended a three-game losing streak and
improved to 2-0 against his former team. Mike Jackson, another
former Mariner, picked up his 33rd save. ... Six of the Mariners'
nine losses to the Indians have been by one or two runs. ... Edgar
Martinez had two hits, including his 25th homer. ... Second baseman
Joey Cora extended his hitting streak to 12 games with a
third-inning double. Rodriguez also doubled in the inning, but was
thrown out attempting to steal his 39th base. ... Pro golfer Mark
O'Meara, Ken Griffey Jr.'s friend and Florida neighbor, was among
the clubhouse visitors. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch,
wearing an Indians cap. ``Yeah,'' said Griffey, ``but he took it
off quickly.''

WASHINGTON TIGHT END LEADING BY EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Reggie Davis came out of Southern California destined
to be a great rover back at the University of Washington. Then he
was going to be a great inside linebacker. Then a great outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was going to get it done at defensive end, and outside
linebacker again, and then at H-back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, facing his last season as a Husky, he is their starting
tight end, and it becomes clearer how his teammates voted the honor
of co-captain to a guy who had two receptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has made more whistlestops than a politician stumping for
the Iowa primary. Everywhere he's been, he's collected a few more
votes. There's no veteran among the Huskies who can say he doesn't
know Reggie Davis pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Davis is one of the most responsible people I know,''
wide receiver Gerald Harris said. ``He does things the right way.
People on defense respect him. People on offense respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' parents were in town for the first two-a-day workouts,
regular visitors to each practice. Those jaded by Davis' eclectic
history at Washington might have concluded they were here just to
make sure their son wasn't switched again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hoping he'd be on the defensive side,'' said his
mother, Pearlie, referring to his early UW days. ``But he's always
been someone who has tried to make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will all come together for Davis, now in his fifth
season at Washington, a player who received eight votes among 10
possible in Best of the West voting when he came out of a small
high school in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pleasing Davis no end, that would please at least one
woman on the UW campus who has seen Mark Bruener, Ernie Conwell and
Cam Cleeland pass through the program in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting my books at the bookstore,'' said Brock Huard,
the UW quarterback. ``One of the older gals in there said, `Why
aren't you guys throwing the ball to the tight end?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bruener had 34 catches his senior year. Conwell had 24 as a
senior, Cleeland 19 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis might surpass all of them. At 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, he
will be a different kind of tight end than the
block-first-catch-later players who lately have been demanded at
Washington. He may be symbolic of an evolving offensive philosophy
at the UW: Set up the run with the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that happening,'' Davis said. ``Just from the way
things have been going (in practice), I think that's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, it appeared it was never going to happen
for Davis. Players usually emerge because of practice repetitions,
and Davis was never anywhere long enough to do much other than say
sayonara. He even got a fleeting look at quarterback, one of his
high school positions.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Christian, he was tested more than once. So when he was
approached about filling Cleeland's role before spring practice _
albeit with the chance of putting a positive finish on a
peripatetic career _ he was less than wowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I was happy with the decision, that would be a lie,''
Davis says. ``But I'd been taught to respect authority. The coaches
were put there by God and they know what they're doing. I do my
best to bite my tongue and do what they ask for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tongue-biting wasn't always so easy, while the Husky coaches
fretted over what they saw as Davis' lack of instinct on defense.
Clarence Davis, his dad, says the weight of the whole parish at
Grace Brethren Church in Long Beach has been behind Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all the people of our congregation praying for him,''
the senior Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis needed all of it.
</P>

   ``With all the position changes, I thought, well, maybe they're
trying to tell me something,'' he said. ``I almost left a few
times. I started inquiring about other schools. My mom filled out
an application for another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we did a whole lot of praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis concluded it was just another test of his faith. Maybe,
finally, it will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give him a chance to go out and prove what we think we
already know about this guy,'' offensive coordinator Scott Linehan
said. ``The best thing is, he runs. He's a 4.5 type of runner, and
for his size, that's moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see us recruiting that kind of guy more. We wouldn't
ever turn down the Brueners and Conwells, but you can make a lot of
hay with guys who can stretch the field. Once you do that, you have
ways of getting the ball short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll have that Shannon Sharpe-type ability,'' Huard
said. ``You put him one-on-one against a linebacker, and he's going
to win 10 out of 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has sharpened his leadership skills as president of
Washington's 50-person student-athlete advisory council, a body
that voices athlete concerns to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is asked whether athletes should be paid. The usually
flat-broke side of him says yes. The quixotic side says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would taint the game,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There remains some nobility to the game, he seemed to be saying.
No matter how it sometimes exasperates.

PEREZ X-RAY IS NEGATIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Left-hander Carlos Perez, who has struggled since
joining the Los Angeles Dodgers on the July 31 trading deadline,
was examined Wednesday for injuries he suffered in an auto accident
a week before he joined the club.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, winless in five Dodgers starts with a 6.35 ERA, had an
X-ray on his nonpitching shoulder during a morning meeting with Dr.
William Dillin, the club's back specialist. The results were
negative, but there is considerable swelling in the shoulder and
Perez was given anti-inflammatory medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not something that I will blame for my problems,'' said
Perez, who also broke his nose in the accident. ``It has been hard
to sleep, but I don't sleep a lot anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 30, joined the Dodgers on Aug. 1 with shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek and pitched seven scoreless that day against the New
York Mets. Perez, who usually displays excellent control, walked
six that day and his control remains one of his biggest problems
(16 in 281/3 IP).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain that,'' said Perez, who starts Friday in the
series opener against the New York Mets. ``I feel comfortable here.
My fastball feels good and so does my changeup, but I've had some
trouble with my split (fingered fastball). I just haven't been
sharp `'
</P>
<P>
   Expos officials say the auto accident was serious and Perez was
lucky to suffer light injuries when the car he was driving July 26
struck a pole. For the six days before his first start with the
Dodgers, Perez did not run or throw.
</P>
<P>
   __ Galarraga suspended: Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga
was suspended Wednesday by National League president Leonard
Coleman for charging the mound after being hit by a pitch last
Saturday by Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has been hit 22 times this season and vowed last
Tuesday that he would charge the next pitcher that threw at him.
Dreifort also hit Galarraga with a pitch Aug. 16. The two exchanged
words, but Saturday's incident led to a bench-clearing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves vowed they would retaliate against Dreifort,
upsetting interim general manager Tom Lasorda, who called for a
suspension longer than the standard three games.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, Lasorda said he was pleased with the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what (San Francisco's) Barry Bonds got when he charged
the mound (in Philadelphia last month),'' Lasorda said. ``I just
wanted them to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More Lasorda: Lasorda, who received a huge ovation when he
appeared on the left-field video screen in the third inning, spent
much of Wednesday in interviews with Florida Marlins general
manager Dave Dombrowski, who is here to talk about the vacant GM
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are expected to speak this weekend with New York
Mets assistant Omar Minaya, who is not believed to be serious
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, however, dismissed reports that appeared in New
York-area Newsday that Mets' manager Bobby Valentine is being
considered for the Dodgers GM position. ``I laughed out loud when I
heard that one,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has two years remaining on his contract that
stipulates he cannot manage with any other team. However, some
believe that does not exclude him from taking a GM position.
Lasorda said he has not approached club president Bob Graziano
about an interview for Valentine, Lasorda's closest friend in the
game.

COMMENTARY: RUSSIA DELIVERS A BLOW TO GLOBAL CAPITALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia's huge default on its debts, and the harsh terms it is
offering to those foreigners who made the mistake of lending money
to it, have petrified investors and are making capital much harder
to get for other countries around the world. For that reason, the
default is also increasing the risk of global recession.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, Russia has never been as important as it was
politically. Investors had assumed that the West would do whatever
was necessary to prop up the Russians, if only to keep nuclear
weapons from falling into the wrong hands. In fact, there seemed to
be an assumption that private loans to nearly any government
carried an implicit Western guarantee, although none had been
promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not give one nickel to help any creditor or
investor,'' said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Nevertheless, in
previous bailouts engineered by Rubin, whether in Mexico in 1995 or
Korea last year, investors in government bonds did well because
that seemed necessary to avoid economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not news that Russia had big economic problems, or that
the government had been unable to solve them. But until last week
investors still thought default was all but impossible. In June
Russia was unable to borrow all the rubles it needed, even at
extraordinarily high interest rates. But it was able to borrow
$1.25 billion in dollars from foreign investors, who were promised
about 12 percent a year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who bought one of those bonds in June, and tried to
sell it now, would lose nearly two-thirds of the money invested.
And naive investors are not the only ones who have suffered. Funds
managed by the international financier George Soros lost a lot of
money, as did Credit Suisse First Boston, the big investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? The International Monetary Fund package
assembled this summer proved to be far too small, given the chaos
in the Russian government. The IMF lacked the money to put together
the much larger package of aid that would have been necessary to
avert default, and major Western governments, including the United
States, refused to put up their own money. In an interview with a
German newspaper, Stanley Fischer, the deputy director of the IMF,
blamed Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany for the West's failure to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the safety net withdrawn, the ruble appears to be in
free fall. Those who lent money to Russia are being forced to trade
in their old securities _ which promised extraordinarily high
returns for lending money for only a few months _ for securities
yielding lower interest rates over a longer time. The risk is that,
even assuming Russia is able to honor its latest promises, the
rubles it pays back will be worth far less than the ones it
borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear now who is really in charge in Moscow. President
Yeltsin's choice of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister needs
parliamentary ratification, which may not be forthcoming unless he
can reach agreement with the Communist leadership of the Duma. And
even if that happens, there is no guarantee the government will be
able to collect taxes and actually administer the country. The
outlook for the Russian people is grim.
</P>
<P>
   So too may be the outlook for countries far away from Russia,
with economies and governments in far better shape. Investors,
having awakened to the reality of risk, now are pulling money out
of emerging markets from Hong Kong to Brazil. At best, many
governments will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow,
putting a damper on growth. At worst, they will find new capital
unavailable at reasonable costs, and will have to strain to repay
loans as they come due. Russia's direct importance to the world
economy may turn out to be far smaller than its impact on investor
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the damage can be limited, and investors will decide
that Russia's problems should not affect their views of, say,
Argentina. But if not, economic incompetence in post-Soviet Russia
could prove to be a bigger threat to world capitalism than Stalin
ever was.

AMERICA NEEDS A REALITY CHECK ABOUT `ANDRO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Contractors have been hired, scaffolding is going up
and hammers are flying on the greatest rebuilding project since the
Marshall Plan: Rationalizations for Mark McGwire's drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same rehab is going on for Bill Clinton's image. But
more Americans care about the home run record than the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Clinton and McGwire are twins joined at the
headline. They are the two most talked-about icons in America at
the moment, for all the obvious reasons plus one more:
</P>
<P>
   Both were caught cheating on the job, and most people don't want
to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   America doesn't want to know where Clinton puts parts of his
body or what McGwire puts in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are so eager to believe the best in those who have
done well by us that we don't want to hear they cheated.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has labored nobly on the edge of sports' most glamorous
record for more than a decade. He donates his time to children's
causes, can cry a big man's tears and is as close to Superman as we
get without finding a spaceship from Krypton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like or despise Clinton, the president is always the
personalized reflection of the nation's good times and bad times,
and we are in the midst of relative prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For the president and the slugger, most people just want
everything to be OK. We don't want the truth, we want reassurance.
This obsessive craving is why Disneyland works: We're perpetually
on a hunt for a world made false by eliminating reality.
</P>
<P>
   A distaste for truth is understandable, but that doesn't mean it
can't be dealt with in a way that doesn't destroy or condemn
everything attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of McGwire, his use of a testosterone-generating
substance called androstenedione does not reduce him and his
achievements to a mere freak of pharmacy. No drug is available that
will give a hitter the reflexes, timing and guts to hit a Randy
Johnson fastball 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But according to anecdotal evidence of some trainers and
athletes, andro may give him the strength to turn a 340-foot fly
out into a 350-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious that McGwire claims to have begun using andro about
a year ago, about the time he fell three homers short of the
record. Apparently, McGwire decided the record was worth the
potential jeopardy to his health, because the 1998 season and its
expansion-diluted pitching might be his last good shot.
</P>
<P>
   His long history of injury, coupled with the fact that he is the
oldest player to challenge Roger Maris' mark, has made the
temptation irresistible to indulge andro, a legal, over-the-counter
substance, because the medical evidence does not yet scream in neon
letters about side effects or long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   He can find a number of athletes, trainers and doctors who will
support his conclusion that his regulated consumption is safe. Just
as a similar number of medical professionals can be found who will
say that conclusion isn't possible yet, as well as those who will
testify that andro's two primary uses are to mask detection of
steroids, as East German athletes did for years, and serve as a
sexual stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the facts, McGwire's tacit endorsement of andro will
cause instant over-consumption by those least able to draw
distinctions and make judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire episode has been one great big advertisement for
the drugs,'' Charles Yesalis, professor of human and performance
development at Penn State and author of ``The Steroids Game,'' told
The New York Times. ``You're going to have all kinds of kids
running out to the malls to buy it. Regardless of what the
Cardinals may say, andro is one honest-to-God sex steroid. This is
not vitamin C.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that baseball hasn't banned it is no surprise, given
the time warp in which the game exists. The sport has no rules on
performance enhancers. Can't wait to see the expression on
commissioner Bud Selig's face when he finds out teams no longer
travel to games by train.
</P>
<P>
   To limit the potential damage, what McGwire needs is full
disclosure, however difficult it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Use of performance enhancers is a huge international sports
issue, but largely ignored in the U.S. because we don't much care
about the sports where drugs are rife, such as track, swimming and
cycling.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's acknowledgment opens the door for a national
discussion on what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable drugs;
which substances are therapeutic and which enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
   As was written here about EPO, another naturally produced
hormone whose abuse scandalized the Tour de France, it's time to
consider separate classes of competition, open and pure, because
crooks are so far ahead of cops.
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing and disillusioning as it was to see McGwire's
lack of trust in his own natural abilities, he has a chance to
regain the trust of those who still think honesty is a worthwhile
thing.
</P>
<P>
   He, the Cardinals and baseball can take the lead in being open
about use of andro and any other history of performance enhancing
substances, knowing McGwire's previous goodwill will create a fair
response from the sports public.
</P>
<P>
   Or, they can continue the national trend of running away from
the truth.

COMMENTARY: SHADOW OF A HERO 
</HEADLINE>

(JT)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Androstenedione is legal in the United States, and Mark McGwire,
a remarkably muscular man who hits home runs for a living, has a
right to use it. Whether it's a good idea to use it is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, a first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, has had a
glorious summer and is now closing in on the single-season home run
marks of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. Kids idolize him. Fans have
been filling ballparks from coast to coast to watch him swing his
mighty bat. When he comes to town, it's not enough to see the ball
game. You have to show up early enough to catch batting practice,
to watch his screaming line drives and long, towering flies.
</P>
<P>
   Even when McGwire is on the road he gets standing ovations.
After a McGwire home run on Sunday at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Stadium, the delirious Pittsburgh fans demanded a curtain call, an
extremely rare honor for a visiting player.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, somewhat embarrassed, obliged. He stepped from the
dugout and tipped his cap. The fans went wild. Later McGwire would
say, ``I wish every baseball player could feel what I'm feeling
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a controversial substance, currently
classified as a dietary supplement, that is taken in pill or
capsule form. It is converted by the body into testosterone.
Athletes take it because they believe this temporary testosterone
boost can help build muscle and increase their strength and
endurance. McGwire, who in past years has lost substantial playing
time to injuries, recently acknowledged that he uses
androstenedione. He said it increased the efficiency of his
weight-room workouts.
</P>
<P>
   This acknowledgment has cast a shadow over his dream season.
</P>
<P>
   While it can be purchased over the counter and its use has not
been prohibited by Major League Baseball (although the league is
now, belatedly, taking another look), androstenedione has been
banned by the National Football League, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association and the International Olympic Committee. Randy
Barnes, the Olympic shotput champion, is facing a lifetime ban
because he tested positive for androstenedione in April.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives? Is Mark McGwire in better shape to hit home runs
because he's taking a pill that promotes the development of lean
muscle mass? A pill that can make a strong man even stronger?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows. The Cardinals and McGwire issued a joint statement
this week that said androstenedione ``has no proven anabolic
steroid effect nor significant side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Yesalis, a professor at Penn State University and
author of the book ``The Steroids Game,'' said, ``The whole idea is
to convince people that you're not really taking a drug, that this
is not cheating, and most certainly that you are not taking
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, this is a steroid. What is debatable is
whether this is an anabolic steroid. Does it have anabolic
qualities _ tissue-building qualities?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at the New
York University School of Medicine and the lead author of the
influential textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete,'' said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody particularly knows whether
androstenedione itself has anabolic qualities. But the substance
that androstenedione is converted into unequivocally has anabolic
properties. It's the father of all anabolic steroids. Testosterone.
So if, in fact, depending on the dose _ a critical issue _ if you
can raise the amount of testosterone in your blood by taking enough
of this stuff, then it's anabolic, provided you lift the weights
and do all the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is looking at
androstenedione, but Federal officials have not determined whether
it should be regulated and controlled as anabolic steroids are. Too
little is known about it, officials said, including its long-term
effects.
</P>
<P>
   So Mark McGwire is operating safely within the boundaries of the
law and the rules of his sport. But there are other considerations.
Each new home run gives the nation a thrill. As he draws closer to
Ruth's 60 and Maris' 61, each at-bat will likely be televised live
to the nation. A lot of young people will be looking on, admiring
their hero, trying to follow his example, trying their best to be
like Mark.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There are some things you just don't count on happening twice in a
relatively short period of time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are, lightning won't strike twice in the same place. You
won't win the lottery again. And good luck trying to run roughshod
over Braves pitcher John Smoltz twice in a three-month span.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had their way with the 1996 Cy Young Award winner
earlier this season, but Smoltz cleared his name Wednesday by
pitching the Atlanta Braves to a 6-2 victory before 32,651 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people forget that those guys (the heralded Braves
starters) are human, too,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
``You don't get to them very often, so when you do, you'd better
enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, you're not going to get very many
opportunities against Smoltz, and that was the case tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The setback snapped the Astros' five-game winning streak and
kept their magic number at 19.
</P>
<P>
   Their National League Central Division lead over the Cubs was
trimmed to 10{ games, and the Astros fell 3{ games behind San Diego
for the second-best record in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   The top record belongs to the Braves, and the reason was clear
Wednesday: pitching, pitching and more pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz held the Astros to one run in seven innings, and
relievers Rudy Seanez and Kerry Ligtenberg held the Astros in check
over the final two innings to secure the Braves' 88th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an important game for me,'' said Smoltz, who improved
to 13-2. ``More so because I have to face them again Monday (in
Atlanta), and then again in the playoffs. This is the best I've
felt in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the Astrodome that brings out the best
in Smoltz. He is 10-5 with a 2.94 career ERA in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could take this place on the road with me,'' said
Smoltz, who allowed eight runs in four innings the last time he
faced the Astros. ``I don't know why, but I've always had success
here. They're a very good hitting team, but this is a pitcher's
park.''
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of innings, it appeared Wednesday's game might be a
pitchers' duel. Smoltz and the Astros' Sean Bergman retired the
side in order on their first two trips to the mound, and Bergman
got an out in the third before the Braves finally got a baserunner
_ with some help.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graffanino reached on an error by shortstop Tim Bogar,
whose throw sailed over Bagwell's head at first base. Graffanino
scored on a single by Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' said Bogar, whose strength is his
fielding. ``That's all I can say. It's an easy play, and I have to
make that play every time. Everything snowballed from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make mistakes like that against good pitchers like
Smoltz. Bergy didn't pitch that badly. We didn't help him at all.
If we catch the ball and make the plays, things might have been
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros committed three errors and weren't alert on the bases
as they allowed the Braves to tie the season series at three wins
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tomorrow off, and it looked like we took today off,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``This wasn't one of our better
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves were dazzling in the field _ particularly
center fielder Andruw Jones, who made one highlight-reel catch
after another in the two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made more great catches in one year than I've seen in
probably 10 years,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``He's the best
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' run in the third was unearned, but Bergman had only
himself to blame for Atlanta's three-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After notching two quick outs, Bergman gave up a single to Ryan
Klesko and a two-run homer to Javy Lopez on a 1-0 pitch that caught
way too much of the strike zone. Graffanino singled home Jones to
give the Braves a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to go outside with a fastball, and it came right down
the middle,'' catcher Tony Eusebio said of the home-run pitch. ``If
you make a mistake to Javy Lopez, you're going to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored on Carl Everett's two-out RBI triple in the
fourth, but the Braves took aim at Bergman again in the sixth on
Jones' RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who was replaced by Doug Henry in the sixth, allowed
five runs (four earned) on eight hits and a walk. It was the most
runs he has allowed in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wasn't hitting his spots,'' Eusebio said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie righthander Scott Elarton worked the final two innings
for the Astros, allowing a run in the ninth on a double by Ozzie
Guillen. The Astros made their usual ninth-inning stand, scoring
once, but it wasn't nearly enough.

LEWIS UNLOADS ON A'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of the things you have to like about the Red Sox is
that they know how to win. They know the value of good pitching,
defense, and timely hitting. They may stagger but they seldom beat
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's 7-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics before
26,379 at Fenway Park is a good example. The Sox blew a 4-1 lead
but pulled together the right combination to hand the West Coast
visitors their ninth defeat in 10 meetings this year. The Sox made
two costly errors, one by Nomar Garciaparra and the other by Jim
Corsi, along with a passed ball by Scott Hatteberg. Yet, it didn't
cost them a game.
</P>
<P>
   Boston collected 10 hits, the most important a single with the
bases loaded in the eighth inning by Darren Lewis that broke a 4-4
tie. It gave the Red Sox their third straight win as they protect
their lead in the American League wild-card race. They remained
nine games ahead of Texas and moved 10 in front of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis earned the spotlight with his second game-winner in as
many nights. In Tuesday's series opener, he hit a solo home run in
the seventh inning to give the Sox a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a team victory. Bret Saberhagen had his seventh
no-decision in nine games, but he contributed to the victory, as
did Dennis Eckersley, Corsi, John Wasdin, and closer Tom Gordon.
Gordon got his league-leading 38th save.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi, however, suffered a groin pull in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams used 14 of his 15 available players; only
Orlando Merced did not play. And the last three runs were scored by
pinch runners Damon Buford and Donnie Sadler and pinch hitter Jason
Varitek, illustrating the Sox' philosophy of staying close and
using whoever is needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to be aggressive,'' Lewis said regarding his
eighth-inning single with one out. Boston had filled the bases
against losing pitcher Tim Worrell (2-7) on a single by Mike
Stanley, a sacrifice by Darren Bragg, and back-to-back walks to
Hatteberg and Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and saw that the infield was in,'' said Lewis.
``So I looked for a good pitch to hit and I got one. I love playing
in Fenway Park. For me it's such a good place to hit. There is
plenty of room in right field, and that's really where I like to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team that doesn't make a lot of mistakes, and really
that's the key to our season. You keep mistakes to a minimum. You
help your pitchers out so that they don't have to throw a lot of
extra pitches. All of this makes it easier for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been an easier night for Saberhagen, who threw
only 62 pitches in the first five innings and seemed to be on a
roll. It took an error on a grounder by Rickey Henderson, a double
by Bip Roberts, and a ground out to put him in a 1-0 hole in the
first. But all seemed well when Boston rallied for three runs in
the second inning and made it a 4-1 game in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It changed in the sixth inning, so quickly the Sox bullpen could
not get there fast enough. Saberhagen dug a hole for himself. With
one out, he gave up consecutive singles to Matt Stairs and Ben
Grieve and a walk to second baseman Scott Spiezio. Two runs scored
on a funky ground-rule double by Miguel Tejada, making it 4-3. The
ball traveled only 150 feet down the line before being fielded by a
fan, but it was enough to send Saberhagen to the showers after only
85 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement was Eckersley, who had the misfortune of a
passed ball by Hatteberg on an 0-2 pitch. Saberhagen had pitched
well but had nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that gets under my skin is that I fell behind
on Tejada and had to come in with fastballs,'' said Saberhagen. ``I
got the ball in under his hands, but he hits the carom for a
double. They didn't hit the ball great. But they did what they had
to do to stay in the game. So did we.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen (11-6) says he's not down on himself, even if the
victories are getting harder to come by. ``I'd like to be getting
some wins,'' he said. ``But I'm happy the way I'm throwing the
ball. The team is winning and you look at the scoreboard and
Baltimore is getting beat. You're feeling good. The bottom line is
that if the team wins and you have contributed, you feel like
you're a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a team game, reminds Mo Vaughn. ``First and foremost,'' he
said, ``Bret threw well and deserved to get a win tonight. Any time
we get good pitching like that and have good offense and defense,
the main thing you have to do is play your game. I've become a
believer of this. That's what happened tonight in Darren Lewis. If
we keep ourselves in it, we got a chance to win the game.''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ A vast and plodding Hurricane Bonnie rumbled
ashore near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on Wednesday
afternoon, bringing whipping winds and horizontal squalls through a
region that is still recovering, both physically and emotionally,
from the trauma of back-to-back hurricanes in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As of early Thursday morning, there were no reports of deaths or
serious injuries in the region from the category 3 hurricane, and
its maximum sustained winds had declined to 105 miles an hour from
115 mph. But state officials and weather forecasters worried that
the worst could still be ahead as the slow-moving storm continues
its northerly movement up the North Carolina coast Wednesday night
and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern for residents of the Outer Banks, a narrow
and ecologically fragile chain of barrier islands, was that Bonnie
would move straight up Pamlico Sound nd create surging floodwaters
that could cut new inlets and submerge the islands' single highway.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted that damage assessments of the Outer
Banks, and of much of the rest of the North Carolina coast, would
not be possible until well into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie finally made land after two days of anxious
anticipation, residents here seemed fatalistic about the weather
currents and rotten luck that have brought three hurricanes to
their quaint, well-mannered town in only two years. In 1996, a mild
hurricane named Bertha struck in July, only to be followed two
months later by a devastating category 3 storm named Fran. That
hurricane resulted in 24 deaths in North Carolina, and 34 total,
and caused an estimated $6 billion in property damage, including
hundreds of downed trees in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's impact was symbolized by the destruction of the
197-foot-tall steeple at the First Baptist Church, a local landmark
that is still being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when we heard about this one was that it
couldn't happen again, that you just can't have three in a row,''
said C. Bruce Williams III, a spokesman for New Hanover County's
emergency management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just one of those things,'' said Gary Green, a
37-year-old cook who was waiting out the storm at a shelter at MCS
Noble Middle School here. Green said he liked the area enough to
put up with the enduring threat of wicked weather. ``Where are you
going to run on this planet?'' he asked. ``If you go to the Midwest
you put up with tornadoes. You go to the west coast and you put up
with earthquakes. You choose your poison as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami said that Bonnie's speed
had decreased gradually throughout the day to 8 miles per hour from
nearly double that speed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie will be persisting over eastern North Carolina for at
least another day, creating a serious flood threat from rain,'' the
forecasters said in their 5 p.m. advisory. ``Rainfall totals of 6
to 12 inches are possible. Totals could be much larger, possibly in
excess of 15 or 20 inches if the forward speed of Bonnie decreases
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moore, North Carolina's secretary of Crime Control and
Public Safety, said the storm could churn north toward the Virginia
state line until about 2 a.m. Friday. Moore said there could be as
much as two to three inches of rain per hour almost as far west as
Raleigh. Gale-force winds hit that city Wednesday and flash flood
warnings were issued there.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mayfield, the deputy director of the hurricane center, said
that the eye of the storm moved lethargically from Cape Fear on
Wednesday afternoon to a point just off Wrightsville Beach at about
8 p.m. Mayfield said the hurricane was expected to move in a north
to northeast direction. But he said the storm's slow speed made it
difficult to predict whether it would hug the coastline or take a
more inland path.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, the storm should move out to sea near the
border between North Carolina and Virginia. A hurricane warning
remained in effect Wednesday night from Cape Romain, S.C., to the
North Carolina-Virginia border, while a tropical storm warning was
in effect from Chincoteague, Va., to Cape Henlopen, Del.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million residents and tourists evacuated
coastal areas of North Carolina and South Carolina on Tuesday and
Wednesday morning, filling makeshift emergency shelters in schools
and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews were declared across the region and most bridges from
the mainland to barrier islands were blocked by police cars. An
estimated 97,500 households were without electricity along North
Carolina's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Supply, about 30 miles south of Wilmington, Bonnie's winds
destroyed a portion of the roof at Brunswick Hospital, forcing
officials to move 34 patients to another unit. Here in Wilmington,
a gust blew out a 40-foot section of windows at New Hanover High
School.
</P>
<P>
   On Bald Head Island, near the point of the hurricane's landfall,
47 people were stranded after missing the last ferry Tuesday night
and some took shelter in the island's lighthouse after breaking its
lock. ``It certainly would be better than even the more modern
houses,'' said Andy James, a spokesman for the state's emergency
management team. ``It's been there a long time and weathered a lot
of storms.''
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse squatters were not the only ones trapped by the
storm. On North Topsail Beach on Wednesday afternoon, two young men
stranded on the island ran through the blinding rain when they saw
a sheriff's car stopped on a road. Mitch Fowler, of Burlington, and
Dennis Poythress of Sneads Ferry, had spent the day trying to
repair Fowler's car.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting the car going, it became buried in the sand
and was eventually flooded by rising sea water, Poythress said. ''I
didn't care if it was the pope,'' said a soaking Poythress as he
crawled into the sheriff's car. ``I was ready to get off the
island. I'm about to starve. I want some dry clothes and a dry
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wilmington, the storm splintered a number of the oak
trees that give this city of 60,000 its elegant grace. Power lines
all across town drooped limply from poles and debris-littered
streets became obstacle courses for the few drivers braving the
roads. The almost universal outages forced the daily newspaper
here, the Morning Star, to send its eight-page Thursday edition to
Fayetteville to be printed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although local officials warned that it was early to make broad
assessments, the damage to trees and property here seemed far
milder than that caused two years ago by Hurricane Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some air views of damage and some scouting around by
people,'' David Paynter, a spokesman here for the New Hanover
County Emergency Management Agency, said late Wednesday afternoon.
``It seems the hurricane has not created that much damage, but
we've got at least seven more hours before the main part of the
storm leaves this area.''
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people along the coast fled the hurricane, at
least one family drove here deliberately to witness it. Doug Shales
and his 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, detoured to Wilmington while
returning from Tampa, Fla., to their home in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to experience a hurricane for a long time,''
Shales said. ``We just came on the spur of the moment. It's very
special for us to happen to land somewhere where you're going to be
in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaleses spent the day watching the hurricane through the
picture windows in their room at a Holiday Inn. Shales noted that
his family spent time in 1993 in an historic blizzard atop Beech
Mountain. ``We just kind of really enjoy weather extremes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many people here remained exasperated that they had been
struck by another hurricane before finishing repairs from the last
one. Kathy Rackley, a 39-year-old housewife from Wilmington, said
she still has trees in her yard that were felled by Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of depressing,'' she said. ``You want to see
everything done before something else comes along and blows it all
down.'' Jack Goodhue, who fled a barrier island to take shelter in
a Wilmington motel, summed up the mood of many. ``What's happened
here?'' he asked. ``Have they pinned a target on Wilmington?''

GORDON HAS BEEN ONE TRUE CONSTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom Gordon says his intent and focus have always been
the same. It's never wavered once this season. Whether it was his
first save opportunity or, as was the case in Wednesday night's 7-4
victory over the Oakland A's, his American League-leading 38th
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox closer has always delivered with the same
single-minded determination. Gordon was a model of efficiency when
he started the ninth in relief of eventual winner John Wasdin (6-4)
and got his 38th save (out of 39 opportunities) by throwing just 10
pitches, eight for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Three up. Three out. End of inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I gave, I had. And everything I had, I gave,'' said
Gordon, who had no use, really, for the bulky ice pack bandaged on
his right shoulder after he recorded his 35th consecutive save, the
longest current streak in the major leagues. ``I try to take that
focus into every game. That's my approach, and it's the same for me
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   How can he so blithely dismiss the impressive numbers he is
putting up in this All-Star season? Does he not realize he needs
just three more saves to pass Jeff Reardon (40 saves, 1991) as
Boston's saves leader?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see (the numbers), but I haven't really set any goals,''
Gordon said. ``The only thing I've tried to focus on, like I said
earlier in spring training, was to stay healthy and be able to go
out there and help my team win, regardless the situation.
Fortunately for me, there's been a lot of good situations and I've
been able to execute well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't try to do anything different from what I've done
all year. I take the same approach that I took in spring training
and that's just to be me. And a lot of good things are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon intimated there was one goal he did want to achieve
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real personal thing I've thought about is the World
Series,'' he said. ``I've really thought about it and tried to
picture myself in that game, but that's about it. I don't try to
get too ahead of myself. I try to stay on an even keel and do what
I can to help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Darren Lewis broke a 4-4 tie in the eighth by driving a
ball up the middle to score a pair of runs, it appeared to be all
Gordon needed to close the door on the A's, the same team he faced
when he first moved to the bullpen last Aug. 20, recording a save
in a 5-4 decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Flash has an opportunity to come in and close ballgames,
it doesn't matter if we have one run or two runs, we have the
confidence in him that he's going to get the job done,'' said
Lewis. ``He's been doing it all year. Tonight, he was outstanding
and got ahead right away and threw strikes. Actually, we got him a
little cushion so he could relax a little bit and not have to be on
pins and needles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon didn't seem to have any anxiety, judging from the
workmanlike manner in which he retired the top of Oakland's lineup.
He got Rickey Henderson to line to second, Bip Roberts to fly to
left, and Jason Giambi to strike out swinging on a game-ending 1-2
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do whatever I can to help this team be a winning
team,'' Gordon said. ``I'm not going to change anything, but I'm
going to take every game _ from the first game to the very last
game of the season, it doesn't matter _ and do everything I can to
stay consistent.''

YOUNG BAILS OUT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers wanted to change their
look. Into a winner they hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly their most reliable pitcher, closer Jeff Shaw is
looking a lot like Todd Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who gave up two ninth-inning home runs in Atlanta to end
the road trip, allowed two ninth-inning runs Wednesday night. But
it was Eric Young who picked up the save with a game-winning home
run in the bottom of the ninth that gave the Dodgers a 4-3 victory
over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the ninth, Young hit a 1-2 pitch into the
right-field stands off left-hander Steve Kline. It was Young's
fifth homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Young said. ``Bottom line is we need wins
right now. And it is great that we were able to pick up Jeff
tonight. He has been doing that for us since he got here. That's
what teams do. That's what we need to do.''The Dodgers had juggled
their lineup, puttng Eric Karros into the cleanup spot, and he
responded with a sixth-inning homer. Raul Mondesi, dropped from
third to fifth, appeared to add an insurance run when he singled
home Trenidad Hubbard in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of Valley products had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer of Montclair Prep in Van Nuys opened the ninth with
double off Karros' glove and scored on a single by Shane Andrews.
Shaw took over and gave up an RBI single to Ryan McGuire, who
attended El Camino Real High School and UCLA, that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite blowing his eighth save opportunity of the season, Shaw
(3-6) wound up the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw some pitches I thought were strikes that should have
gotten us out of the game,'' Shaw said. ``(Home plate umpire) Joe
West is a veteran and he wasn't givng the inside pitch. But I'm not
frustrated with the way I threw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' victory hardly spoiled a homecoming for Fullmer,
the Expos' first baseman who also homered in the fourth against
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ninth that the Expos will remember.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw took over after the single by Andrews. Terry Jones pinch
ran and raced to second on Shaw's wild pick off throw.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger popped out to first with Jones running from second,
and the Dodgers nearly got an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   They had to settle for Shaw putting away pinch hitter Bob
Henley. On a 1-2 count, Shaw threw a fastball down and in and the
crowd of 34,039 thought the game was over. Henley fouled off four
more pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Another close call by home-plate umpire Joe West made the count
3-2, and Henley walked on a breaking ball in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up pinch hitter McGuire, who delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Park's second straight and 10th in his last 11
decisions. It also kept the Dodgers seven games back in the
wild-card race to the New York Mets, who play a four-game series
here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off a 4-3 victory Tuesday night, and
with a big four-game series this weekend with Mike Piazza and the
wild-card-leading New York Mets, they wanted to establish some
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Expos right-hander Carl Pavano, who defeated the Dodgers 5-1 on
Aug. 5, wasn't as sharp this time and immediately got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young opened with an infield single, stole second and moved
to third on an infield out. Sheffield followed with a sharp single
to right to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano settled down until Karros' homer in the sixth. But his
young infield made it difficult, committing two throwing errors.
One belonged to former Dodgers second baseman Wilton Guerrero, who
threw away Trenidad Hubbard's potential inning-ending double play
grounder in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield popped to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos did little against Park, who was coming off a 5-1
victory last Friday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer was 2 for 19 on the Expos' last home stand but came in
with a solid .279 average, 10 homers and 60 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Park threw him a fastball on 2-1 and Fullmer drove into the
stands in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went silent, except for cheering from the seats
beneath the press box. Fullmer's parents, Judy and Marv, his grand
parents and an aunt were at the game.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to a lot of games here, but never one so special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is excitng but very nerve racking ,'' said Fullmer's
mother. ``It is really kind of neat, because we have been
season-ticket holders here since he was two. He's grown upcoming to
this ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has seen Fullmer play a lot this season, traveling
twice to San Francisco and once in Montreal, Boston, Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since he's been playing ball, he's here,''
Judy said after the home run. ``It's nice to see him play here.
When he was in the minor leagues, he played all his games on the
East Coast, never once making it West of the Mississippi.''

 `JUST SAY NO' NOT ENOUGH FOR BASEBALL  &HT;     By C.W. NEVIUS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Well, you'd have to think this is not the kind of national news
story Major League Baseball was hoping to get out of Mark McGwire.
In response to reports that McGwire is taking _ and making no
secret of it _ the testosterone-producing pill androstenedione,
officials in baseball and the players' union are calling on doctors
to ``gather information'' on performance-enhancing pills.
<P>
   Let's hope they realize what they are doing, because this is
going to open a major-league can of worms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, baseball's drug testing procedure could use some
revamping. It is a relic from the days of widespread, embarrassing
recreational drug use. The official drug policy says the league is
testing for ``the following controlled substances: cocaine,
marijuana, amphetamines, opiates and phencyclidine (PCP).''
</P>
<P>
   There is a vague reference to a ``prohibition ... to all illegal
drugs and controlled substances, including steroids,'' but the
reality is that, as the drug policy states later, ``Major League
players are not subject to unannounced testing for illegal drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, who co-wrote the book ``Drug and the Athlete,''
and is a clinical associate professor of medicine at Cornell
University, says baseball is not the only sport with its head in
the sand regarding muscle-building drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the NBA,'' he says. ``There is no testing for anabolic
steroids at all. I can't believe that. The thing about steroids is
that they keep the body from breaking down. With the NBA's
demanding schedule, steroids would be obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   But in almost every case in which a drug-testing program is put
into place, it is in reaction to a large public outcry _ hello Mr.
McGwire. And that's where the fun begins.
</P>
<P>
   First, as Dr. Wadler says, ``the stark reality of this is that
(a drug policy) is a negotiated thing.'' The policy is an agreement
between the leagues and the players' unions. The NBA doesn't even
test for marijuana, which has become one of the sticking points in
the lockout. Issues of privacy, and the prying into what someone
does in his private life _ legal or not _ are open for debate.
</P>
<P>
   But drugs that help players become stronger and faster change
the game. If Ben Johnson lost his 1988 Olympic gold medal because
he was using steroids, should McGwire at least have an asterisk
next to his name in the record book if it can be proved that he was
using performance drugs if he breaks the home run record?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Dr. Wadler puts it, ``(Former world record-holding shot
putter) Randy Barnes has to be wondering, `How come (McGwire) is a
national hero, and I'm banned for life?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wadler then answers his own question. The reason is that
Barnes was caught using drugs that were clearly forbidden by track
and field. McGwire is simply taking advantage of a loophole large
enough for a 260-pound slugger to walk through.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, despite denials from the McGwire camp, Dr. Wadler
has no doubts McGwire's use of androstenedione is
performance-enhancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Androstenedione is testosterone waiting to happen,'' Dr.
Wadler says. ``It is itself a steroid by becoming testosterone,
which is a banned substance, in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's where we enter a gray area. Everyone has testosterone
in his or her body. The question is how much? And what about
players who use ``andro'' or other supplements to ``mask'' strength
gains from actual anabolic steroids. Clearly, this is not an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the testing itself. A good example is the NFL's first
attempt at a testing program years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced that it would test football players each
year at training camp. In the first year, they were delighted to
hear that they only caught half a dozen players with drugs in their
system. Meanwhile, those who knew that it only takes 28 days for
the drugs to vanish from the body were barely able to contain their
snickers.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Wadler said on The Today Show at the time, ``That wasn't
a drug test, it was an IQ test.'' And those six flunked.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the only way to catch offenders is, as Dr.
Wadler says ``out of competition, random testing.'' After all, if
baseball players are bulking up with steroids, they aren't doing it
during the season, it is happening during their workouts over the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   But does baseball want to get involved in that sort of hassle?
First, you have to locate players in the off-season, get them to a
testing site, and create an enforcement team that would supervise
the tests. These tests would have to be ``observed samples,'' of
course, meaning that someone would have to stand there and watch
while these sports superstars fill up the urine cup.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the really bad news. What if you actually
start catching people? Consider the sports that have done the most
to crack down on performance drugs _ swimming and track and field.
Each has a comprehensive drug program, iron-clad punishment and
wide-ranging powers.
</P>
<P>
   And what have they gained for their efforts? A perception from
the public that these sports are filled with cheaters, that almost
everyone is using drugs, and that the best in the sport aren't
getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   It may be better to be blissfully ignorant, watching the soaring
home runs, rather than worrying about how the muscles that
propelled them were created. Up until now baseball's
muscle-building drug policy was simple: don't ask, don't tell.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball should change its performance drug policy. But
remember, if it does, the days of the easy answers are finished.  &LR;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: TECHNOLOGY FOR THE MASSES

   WASHINGTON _ Internet guru Esther Dyson views her virtual world
as ``a source of untold productivity _ or a medium for terrorists,
con artists, and untrammeled lies and viciousness.'' It's also a
place that favors the technologically elite _ savvy users with
smooth access to cyberspace and other nifty digital tools.
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world, whether by dint of age, class, education
or race, many folks remain technologically deprived. Prosperous
people enjoy free banking privileges online while less prosperous
ones are often relegated to check-cashing emporiums in tired zones
deserted by neighborhood banks.
</P>
<P>
   Since minimum-wage earners live largely in a cash culture,
technology that better connects them to cash helps right the social
balance. One such innovation, dubbed Mr. Payroll, is a self-service
electronic kiosk that cashes any kind of check for all comers at
all hours.
</P>
<P>
   Says Mr. Payroll president Michael Stinson: ``Essentially, we
are enabling low-income underbanked people to live easier lives.
It's a large demographic pool.'' (The company, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, is a branch of Cash America International, a leading pawn
broker.)
</P>
<P>
   Stinson's cardless machines use state-of-the-art digitized
cameras to scan faces and, if necessary, search bank data bases
before funds spew out. Fees are 1 percent for payroll and
government checks, 2 percent for money orders and tax refunds, and
3 percent for personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the initial rollout, 57 Mr. Payroll kiosks
have been sold to convenience outlets and the like for $55,000
apiece. Now installed in 15 states, they have already cashed
270,000 checks valued at more than $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   Planetary Motion Inc. of Glencoe, Ill., is yet another start-up
firm offering technology for the masses. Their bright idea is a
text-to-speech conversion service that delivers e-mail by phone,
bypassing personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phones are everywhere and people figured out long ago how to
use them,'' notes Robert Newman, the company's chairman and chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing a year-long trial in Chicago, CoolMail has
rolled out in 13 major cites and will span the nation within
another eight weeks. Although the basic service is free, users hear
a 10-second ad before retrieving their messages. The deliveries can
be from their CoolMail address, or, via cyberspace jumpers, from
any other subscribed site that tracks standard Internet protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Voice responses to other CoolMail users are also free, making
the service particularly useful to people on the go and to the
visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Newman said, without ever having to fire up
a browser, CoolMail subscribers also will be able to filter all
their incoming messages. Alternatively, at the touch of a button,
they can respond to mail with a direct phone call. CoolMail plans
to add fax capability to its current two-way conversions, enabling
all three media to function interchangeably together.
</P>
<P>
   While the companies haven't talked, phones in a Mr. Payroll
kiosk could be rigged to access CoolMail, thereby allowing, say,
students to let parents know they had just cashed their check, all
without paying for a call home.

 &HT;    Dentist's hobby takes flight - spans 25 years
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Dr. Steven Harris' hands aren't
earning him a living in his West Palm Beach dentistry practice,
they're usually involved with his hobby du jour _ including but not
limited to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rallying his Miata with his wife, Karen
</P>
<P>
   _ Target shooting with his grown daughters, April and Jennifer
</P>
<P>
   _ Banjoing by himself (he notes a distinction between his
banjoing and actual music)
</P>
<P>
   Harris' hobbies come and go _ the computer, the cameras and,
lately, the golf obsession. But these amusements, the family
agrees, are mere dalliances beside the sustaining passions of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   One of those passions sidles up to him on the sofa and says,
``You can tell him about your other love.'' The speaker would be
Karen, 45, his wife and colleague at the office. As she snuggles
under his arm, he leans into her, an old dating trick to maximize
body contact. They luxuriate in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's confession time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an RC modeler,'' Harris, 52, declares without remorse. ``I
build and fly radio-control aircraft. I'm a member of the Palm
Beach Aero Club. We fly them at the fairgrounds and at a field in
Stuart.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen explains: ``We came into his life 25 years ago in Phoenix,
when he was in the Air Force. I was a dental assistant in town. We
met on the base when I came to the clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve happened to pass through her office. Then he happened to
pass three or four more times. After about the fifth
reconnaissance, Karen decided that her future husband was pretty
cute for a mentally deficient mute, and asked ``What are you doing
tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Improvising brilliantly, the Air Force captain replied: ``Taking
you out to dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, in the final months of his service
commitment, when Harris was planning a move to South Florida to
open a practice near family members, he was smitten with his other
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patient asked to borrow one of my dental burrs,'' he said.
``He needed it for detail work on one of his radio-control
models.''
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Steve visited the base RC aero club and fell hard for
his mistress, remote-control planes.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, in the days before radio-controlled free flight,
Steve had built gasoline-powered models, when the airplane was
flown in a tight circle by wire.
</P>
<P>
   But here was pure flight, a pilot with a stick with radio
controls commanding ailerons, elevators, rudders, throttles, even
landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   And something more: These models were the devil to build _
exquisite in detail, breathtaking in finish and ruinously
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The radio itself cost $450, a princely sum in the 1970s. A scale
model of a fighter or a biplane with scaled-down but comparable
performance abilities could cost hundreds more and require 500
hours to build.
</P>
<P>
   And consider: a single mistake at the controls could reduce a
model to smoldering kindling.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your high-maintenance mistresses. How could he
resist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very good with my hands,'' says Steve,
recalling how he built his first plane _ a trainer _ for $26, and
got a radio at half-price by building it himself. ``And,'' he adds,
``I had always wanted to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   And these airplanes fly _ taxiing, taking off, climbing,
rolling, looping, diving and landing _ all at the command of a
pilot who must orchestrate throttle, ailerons and elevator input
from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That plane, he understood at once, is not balsa and paint up
there. It is you. If it crashes, you crash. Le petite mort
flambeau. The small death, flames included.
</P>
<P>
   Since building and learning to fly that first model, he has
built dozens of ever more elaborate models, each of astonishing
fidelity to their full-scale counterparts. They dangle from his
garage ceiling and grace his dentistry office, frozen in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are toys,'' he admits, ``but toys that you can play with
after you've built them.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also dabbled in radio-controlled cars, boats and
motorcycles but quickly tired of them. After all, RC cars and
boats, when you get down to it, scoot. Model airplanes fly, and
they fly spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor asks the obvious question: ``Don't you want to
graduate to airplanes you can fly from the inside?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, he admits. He has logged stick time co-piloting
friends' airplanes, and the truth? No big thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, RC piloting skills translate nicely to big airplanes.
Smiling now, he notes that the reverse is not true. But for RC
pilots, who learn flight control standing in a field with a radio
control box in his hands, remote control eventually becomes innate
control, an unconscious melding of mind and model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there came a time that I was no longer thinking
`left' or `right,' '' he says. ``I was just willing the airplane to
do what I wanted it to do. I was one with the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   And his wife understands this and does not begrudge the Saturday
and Sunday mornings spent at airfields, the untold hours working in
his garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work side by side in the office,'' she explains. ``Every
morning, we get up at 5 and go to the spa and work out. We have the
Miata Club, and I have my church activities and my crafts.''
</P>
<P>
   They exchange smiles, and I recall a line from a movie in which
a father counsels his daughter on the eve of her marriage not to
smother her husband but to ``let there be spaces in your
togetherness.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Karen repeats a story they like to tell about the RC
modeler who insisted that his wife come out to the airfield to
watch him fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `OK, I'll spend an afternoon watching you fly toy
airplanes if you'll spend an afternoon watching me sew.' ''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What's behind indictment of anti-Castroites?
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Aug. 30, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ America's policy toward Cuba and its exile community is
much like the old expression about the weather: If you don't like
the weather now, wait five minutes; it will change.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, a U.S. grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted seven
Cuban exiles on charges of plotting to murder Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years ago, John Kennedy and, likely, his brother
Bobby could have been indicted for the same reason _ and they were
president and attorney general of the United States at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In its first reaction to the indictments, in which an officer of
the Cuban American National Foundation was named, the organization
called it politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   That's a broad term. I'm not certain if by ``political'' they
meant it was something brought on them by the Clinton
administration or by some zealous prosecutor in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows the policy of the Clinton administration toward
Cuba, please tell me. I assure you it will be as vague, and wobbly,
as those of the Nixon, Carter, Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   That the feds say the indictments passed through the highest
levels of the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., would cast a
light on Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, a Miami native who
has experienced a lifetime of dealing with the tender issue of
fervent Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   I do find it odd, however, that after all these years of
threatening and isolating Castro, the United States finds a need to
indict people for plotting to kill the Cuban dictator. For many of
the 38 years of Castro, covert if not official U.S. policy was to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   For the U.S. to cast a shocked eye on anyone who would plot to
kill a head of state reeks of hypocrisy, since the U.S. dearly
would love to put one between the eyes of Saddam Hussein; actually
bombed the tent of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, killing his son; and
now is targeting Osama bin Laden, not a head of any state, but a
princely overseer of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Castro takeover, Cuban exiles _ under the
training and watchful eye of the U.S. _ prepared themselves to
retake the island. History recalls it as the Bay of Pigs and the
U.S. was waist-deep in the plotting, only to leave the invaders
stranded on the beach when the situation seemed lost.
</P>
<P>
   In all the years since, U.S. policy on many Cuban issues has
fluctuated so often that anyone involved has lost track on where we
stand vis-a-vis Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One minute we're training exiles to launch raids on Cuba, the
next minute we're intercepting them. One minute we're plotting an
invasion of the island, the next minute we're promising the old
USSR that we will not.
</P>
<P>
   One minute we allow exiles floating toward the U.S. in rubber
rafts to reach our shores and stay. Later we change that policy and
begin intercepting the rafts and sending the occupants back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One minute we're allowing exiles to return to the island on
humanitarian visits, the next minute we're not. Then we resume. On
and on it goes, in circles wider than Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. has charged exiles with plotting to kill Castro, a
not-unique strategy and one which the U.S. embraced and failed at,
then stood humiliated before the rest of the world. (Remember,
we're the ones who tried to poison his beard!!)
</P>
<P>
   Circumstance indicates that those indicted were planning to get
Castro when he visited Venezuela last year, but no attempt was
carried through _ the enterprise fizzling because of mechanical
problems and ugly weather at sea.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that there are laws against doing what they
tried to do, but America, itself, has been guilty of the same thing
many times.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding question is how the Justice Department decided
that this was the time to press charges against this particular
group _ and why.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Whipping politicians naked down the street
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one of those Renaissance Weekends later famous because an
obscure governor of Arkansas had been a regular, I found myself on
a panel with Bill Clinton discussing the increasing intrusions into
the personal lives of politicians. Was the ventilation a good or a
bad thing or just, well, you know: a thing?
</P>
<P>
   Did this transparency of political lives scare off good
candidates (while not deterring scalawags, who are as a class
undeterrable) or did it produce honest and open candidates, and if
a bit of both results, which way was the lean?
</P>
<P>
   The political scientists and politicians hemmed and hawed in the
manner of those disciplines, finding strengths and weaknesses in
the evolving change, assets and liabilities, yin and yang, and
generally nudged one another toward the thunderous conclusion that
the situation would bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   I, with the subtle balance and reticent wisdom for which I am
known, held that as far as I was concerned, so the electorate might
at least have one chance in a thousand of not being scammed,
politicians _ I believe my exact words were, ``Politicians should
be whipped naked down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   I wish to change my testimony.
</P>
<P>
   We have now watched Clinton himself whipped naked down the
street. It is not a pretty sight and we, the electorate, are no
better off for it, nor is it likely the effect will be anything but
repulsive to class candidates, thus opening exciting new
opportunities for a career in politics to the sociopaths who figure
they can always get away with it, whatever ``it'' is.
</P>
<P>
   And, worse, if current leaks from the operations of Kenneth
``The Sieve'' Starr can be credited, the Torquemada of the Tidal
Basin means to treat us to details of the president's sexual
misadventures that are none of our business, or of Starr's, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I know: Only folks with something to hide should fear
having a special prosecutor reach down their throats and jerk them
inside out. But the truth is that those few among us who have
nothing to hide are better candidates for canonization than for
rough-and-ready politics.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I should know about politicians:
</P>
<P>
   _ The source of every penny contributed to their campaigns.
Congressional Republicans pushing for faster reporting of that have
a good idea, though not as the substitute for broad
campaign-funding reform they mean it to be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether they carry any debilitating or mortal disease. Their
physician's witness will do. I don't need to muck about in their
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   _ The major sources, but not the details, of their outside
income or accumulated wealth. I don't need to second-guess their
tax returns. If they've been up to something, IRS will have them in
court for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, I don't know how to end the Internet- and
cable-driven scramble into politicians' personal lives, except to
say that if voters become sufficiently repelled or simply jaded,
the market for gratuitous tattling will dry up. Until then, the
least we can do is begin to recognize that our democracy can't
function if politicians can last no longer than it takes for
ruthless malevolence and giddy iconoclasm to tear them down.

 &HT;    Tips on setting up a parent-approved, kid-friendly site for
school work
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A structured study area can turn homework woes into successes,
experts say. One of the key areas parents may consider changing is
the time, place and space their children do their homework. Experts
agree it's a good idea to set up consistent study areas in a quiet
and visible place in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Establishing a place where they know there's no fooling
around, no games and that this is my work space _ that sets the
stage for getting to work than trying to work in the den with the
television or in their room where their toys are,'' said Carole
Perry with the Waco Independent School District. ``It's a good
idea. It sounds so simplistic but it's so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at the kitchen table, on a card table in the dining
room or at a desk in the living room, children should get in the
habit of doing their homework in that one spot each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything that can be consistent about homework helps
the children know that homework is important,'' said Dr. Della
Thomas, coordinator of psychological services with WISD. ``The
consistency of having things in the same place and not having to go
find things cuts down on time and helps them concentrate. It takes
some of the variables out of homework.''
</P>
<P>
   When a family has multiple children and only one desk, that may
mean sharing the kitchen table and keeping each child's supplies in
a separate cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is just borrowing the desk for the school year,
they should still have something that makes that area their own
space while working there, Thomas suggested. This could be their
own jar of pencils, a school picture or little awards they've won,
that is, if those things aren't too distracting.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen table is still the old-fashioned way of doing
homework and works well, especially for younger students whose
attention spans may have them up and out of a desk chair in no time
flat.
</P>
<P>
   As students get older, parents might consider giving a
kitchen-table student a little more leeway and trust and perhaps
look at setting up a desk area.
</P>
<P>
   A little planning should take place before parents rush off to
the furniture or office supply store, said Henry Woodward, Office
Depot store manager. Here's some advice:
</P>
<P>
   n Measure. Parents should decide where they want to place a desk
and then record measurements. Also, if a desk is to house a
computer, measure the pieces of hardware to make sure they'll fit
on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   n Decide on cost. Student desks can cost anywhere from a few
dollars at a garage sale to a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   n Look for quality and workmanship if you're planning on using
the desks for several years or for several children. Many of the
wooden desks are made of pressed particle board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a really good product for an economically minded
customer vs. real wood, which would be very expensive,'' Woodward
said.
</P>
<P>
   n One of the most important factors in setting up a decent study
area for a child is to ensure there is sufficient lighting. An
extra lamp on the desk is always a best bet.
</P>
<P>
   n What about a chair? Price is a substantial deciding factor
when it comes to desk chairs. Parents want to avoid going all-out
on a student's chair, but they do want to make sure it is
comfortable and accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Look for heavy, lasting fabrics, adjustable seats and backs that
can be raised for little people and durable molded wheel casters.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs that roll and rock might not be the best choice for
children who have trouble concentrating, since they might end up
using the chair more as a jungle gym than a seat. A chair that
allows children to put their feet on the ground is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   n When deciding on placement of a study desk, high visibility is
alw nd ask them questions,'' Thomas said. ``And turn off the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedrooms are not as ideal as other rooms of the house, since
parents have a harder time kee too many distractions, such as
stereos, toys and telephones.

 &HT;    Car owners use license plates to ID themselves
 &HT;    By Kevin Tankersley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mary Lou Janke's first grandchild, Brent Sykora, was
learning to talk, he just couldn't pronounce Granny, which is what
Janke wanted him to call her. He could say Grammy, and that evolved
into Gween. When Sykora was about 4, he started calling his
grandmother Dween.
</P>
<P>
   That name stuck, and Janke applied for a personalized, or
vanity, license plate that read DWEEN. That was about 20 years ago.
Sykora is now 23 and has two siblings: Blake, 19; and Shelley, 14.
Today, in honor of the three grandchildren, Janke's plate says
DWEEN 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why this one called me Dween Dween,'' Janke said,
lightly tapping Brent with her cane. ``This one came along'' _
pointing at Blake _ ``and made it Dween 2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's 'Hey Dween,' or 'Dweenster.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The plate began its life on an orange pickup truck, moved to a
gray Ford LTD, and then to its current home on the bumpers of a
blue Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   The plate has brought Janke luck on at least three occasions.
Several years back, the radio station formerly known as KJNE, at
the 102.5 position on the dial, held a contest where listeners
would send in their license plate numbers and then listen to the
station, hoping to hear their plate number announced. Dween won
$1,025 in that contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked to have fainted'' when she won, Janke said. Later on
she also won $102.50 and then $10.25, all from the same station. n
n n
</P>
<P>
   Like Mary Lou Janke, Morris and Lucy Mebane have grandchildren
to thank for their license plate, at least partially.
</P>
<P>
   When Morris, who owned Tri-Cities Pharmacy in Woodway for 18
years, and his son John were in business together, they had to
decide what the son would call the father during working hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to call his dad `Daddy' when working, so he
just referred to him as Mo,'' Lucy Mebane said. John's children
picked up on that.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Mebane said several of her friends call her Luce, so when
they decided, in 1985 or '86, to apply for a vanity license plate
for their 1984 Honda Accord, MOLUCE was a natural. The plate is
still on an Accord, though it's now a 1998 model they recently
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of fun with the plate,'' Lucy Mebane said.
``We had no trouble getting it.'' n n n
</P>
<P>
   Vickie McCrary claims she helped finance the construction of the
Waco Police Department station at Fourth Street and Waco Drive. It
seems she was issued more than her share of speeding tickets while
driving a series of cars, each with the license plate GET ME. The
plate has been on every car she has owned, since 1972. It's
currently on a Chevrolet Iroc Z28 Camaro. n n n
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wegwerth has been asked over the years what the S in his
license plate S SKIER stands for? Snow? Super? Sorry?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the S is for slalom, the act of skiing with only one
ski. Using a single ski, instead of the usual two-ski setup, allows
a skier to make sharper cuts, almost in a zigzag fashion, which
makes for a more intense skiing experience.
</P>
<P>
   S SKIER is attached to a red Jeep Cherokee that Wegwerth's wife,
Arlene, drives. They usually tote their boat, a Ski Supreme, to
Tradinghouse Lake, where the family does its skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Wegwerth has taught his two daughters _ Casidy, 8, and Emory, 6
_ to ski. While Emory has been skiing for about a year, Casidy
learned when she was 3. Arlene Wegwerth learned to ski after she
met Rick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play golf'' or have other hobbies, Wegwerth said.
``All four of us like to ski.''
</P>
<P>
   Wegwerth has had the S SKIER plate for 20 years. It cost an
extra $10 annually in 1978 to register the plates. The price
gradually rose until it cost close to $100 a year for vanity
plates. That's when Wegwerth came close to giving up his set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost dropped it,'' he said, but, like Mary Lou Janke, he
won $120 in a radio contest. The plates paid for themselves that
year, so Wegwerth held on to them.
</P>
<P>
   If Eb Morrow ever forgets his dog's name, he can just look at
the license plate on his Mercury Sable station wagon. The plate
reads GAZEBO. He didn't get the plate for the dog however; he named
the dog after the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the yard of Morrow's North Waco home stands a large gazebo.
Atop the gazebo is a turret from the old Lyons-Adelman house, which
stood on the land where Standard Hat Works now exists. The house
was designed by W.W. Lamour, an early Waco architect who also
designed the Cameron House ``and any number of old, old homes that
were in town,'' Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow moved into his home, which was built in 1903, in 1964,
and added the gazebo when he remodeled.
</P>
<P>
   After Morrow obtained the plate, he purchased his dog, a Vizsla,
a Hungarian pointer retriever breed, and named him Gazebo, as well.
</P>
<P>
   If one were to pull up behind Steve McClain's red Chevrolet van,
the license plate might suggest the driver has divided loyalties.
The plate reads ARK HOG; obviously an Arkansas Razorback fan is
aboard. However, in the middle of the plate is an orange silhouette
of a Longhorn, as in a University of Texas Longhorn. In the days of
the old Southwest Conference, 'Horns and Hogs did not coexist
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, my aunt and uncles, they all hated the
University of Texas with a passion,'' said McClain, who was the
first person on either side of his family not born in Arkansas. ``I
was raised properly, to call the Hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite McClain's love for the Razorbacks, a football
scholarship lured him to Blinn Junior College and then to Stephen
F. Austin State University.
</P>
<P>
   But what about that Longhorn sticker?
</P>
<P>
   McClain's older daughter Kacie is on her way to Austin to become
a freshman member of the Longhorn band. It was the band, in fact,
that attracted her to the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where she's always wanted to go,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   McClain, manager of Barry's Coffee Company, first had the ARK
HOG plate on a Pontiac Bonneville about 20 years ago. Since then
it's been on a GMC Jimmy and a Jeep Cherokee before finding a home
on the bright red van. Red just happens to be one of the school
colors of the University of Arkansas. Was that a factor in picking
out this particular van?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' McClain admits. ``It was just the mood of the day.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Some aims of psychotherapy
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychotherapy is generally thought of as a verbal rather than
medicinal approach to helping individuals with psychological
difficulties. In clinical practice, psychotherapy and medication
are often used together to help treat individuals with emotional
difficulties, such as depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the aims of psychotherapy include assisting individuals
with:
</P>
<P>
   n Gaining insight into the reasons behind their unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   n Changing self-destructive behaviors, including substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   n Difficulties in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   n Communication problems.
</P>
<P>
   n How the individual's past relates to his or her current
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   n Unresolved conflicts with parents and/or siblings.
</P>
<P>
   n Distortions in perceptual and cognitive processes resulting in
faulty thought patterns.
</P>
<P>
   n Adjustments due to disabilities or handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   n Health-related issues caused by psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   There are many types of psychotherapy employed in clinical
practice. Following are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Family therapy _ A form of therapy treating the whole family.
This approach views the individual as part of a system, and
counseling is focused on the entire system, which includes the
members of the family and the family's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive-behavior therapy _ The focus of this approach is to
help individuals identify and change distorted perceptions of
themselves and the world around them. Focus includes past, present
and future and helps individuals challenge their unrealistic,
irrational and erroneous beliefs about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Client-centered therapy _ Often referred to as non-directive
therapy, this type of therapy removes the helping person from the
role of giving much direction and advice and instead lets their
empathi-- and non-judgmental understanding assist in the process of
healthy change.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis _ A form of therapy in which the psychotherapist
encourages the exploration of deeper, unconscious thoughts and
experiences from childhood. This form of therapy often extends over
months or even years.
</P>
<P>
   Couple's therapy _ Focuses on the relationship and communication
patterns between partners.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health care providers trained to provide psychotherapy
include psychiatrists, psycholog hiatric nurses, psychiatric social
workers and pastoral counselors. Referrals to a psychotherapist
often come from physicians, ministers and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling comfortable with the therapist is essential. An open and
trusting relationship is one of the most important elements in the
psychotherapeutic process.
</P>

 &HT;    Yearwood's latest slick, smart
 &HT;    By Carl Hoover
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service Waco Tribune-Herald
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Where Your Road Leads, Trisha Yearwood sticks to what's made
her one of Nashville's top female performers: upbeat songs and slow
ballads that showcase her satin-smooth alto.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest album shows one of the perks of success: slick, smart
production values, with songs from top-drawer writers like Jamie
O'Hara, Don Schlitz, Gordon Kennedy, Diane Warren, even Carole
King.
</P>
<P>
   It's listenable, as all of Yearwood's seven albums have been,
but mainstream and safe, with enough country flourishes like an
occasional accent, steel guitar twang or mandolin/fiddle lick to
keep critics from labeling it a pure pop-rock album.
</P>
<P>
   Where Your Road Leads finds its energy in foot-tappers like
``Powerful Thing,'' ``That Ain't The Way I Heard It'' and ``There
Goes My Baby.'' What's missing are the knock-dead ballads from
earlier albums, haunting songs like ``A Bus To St. Paul'' or ``The
Song Remains The Same'' that lingered with the listener long after
the CD finished spinning.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in Where Your Road Leads with that staying power
or quicksilver magic. Sure, ``There Goes My Baby'' has a catchy
hook, ``That Ain't the Way I Heard It'' offers an insistent
backbeat and the dark, dreamy ``Love Wouldn't Lie To Me'' has a
barbed surprise in its chorus.
</P>
<P>
   But one wishes Yearwood would have been a little more
adventurous in her song selection, with something more daring or
different than the predictable here.
</P>
<P>
   The album's biggest misstep, and probably its most successful
single, is her duet with Garth Brooks, ``Where Your Road Leads.''
</P>
<P>
   She knocks it out like a power ballad, showing the muscle behind
her voice, but the backing arrangement suffers from overkill:
strings and a choir. All this for _ a love song?
</P>
<P>
   One wishes Yearwood enough success from this album to try
something new next time, maybe a pairing with someone from this
summer's Lilith Tour, even a country Lilith Tour of her own. Or
something closer to pure rock, as Emmylou Harris' Wrecking Ball, or
pure pop, the direction k.d. lang has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   This is wishful thinking, I know: Country audiences too often
punish their stars for stepping beyond the familiar. So perhaps the
more realistic request is a broader search for those haunting
ballads, the ones that showed Yearwood much more than country's
blonde cotton candy of the month.

 &HT;    Don't save your children from 'Saving Private Ryan'
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I took all of my children to see ``Saving Private Ryan.'' I took
them though I had heard all about the intensity of the first 20
minutes. I knew about the blood and the gore. I had heard the
stories of grown men crying in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is I took them because of all of those things. I took
them because, try as I might to prevent it, they relish in seeing
Arnold Schwarzenegger blast people away with glee. To be sure,
there is plenty of blood in a Schwarzenegger film, but it is almost
always the blood of ``bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   I took my children knowing full well that some in the audience
would criticize the move and perhaps some of you do, too. I'll
admit that a few years ago I came within seconds of taking them all
-- two years younger -- to see ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something wrong in our thinking when make-believe is
more acceptable than a decent rendering of what actually happened.
Network TV has shown endless streams of Schwarzenegger films but
how will it show ``Saving Private Ryan'' without leaving most of it
on the cutting room floor? I cannot imagine.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to pick only on Schwarzenegger, there are half a
dozen others. Pick Bruce Willis if you like.
</P>
<P>
   In ``action'' films, people die easily, almost effortlessly and
with great creativity (only the leader of the bad guys has a long
road to death). What's more, everyone is happy to see them die.
It's great fun. But death is no holiday in ``Saving Private Ryan''
and it is clear that this is just what Stephen Speilberg intended.
Every time you watch a person die in this film -- every single time
-- it is a painful experience. Before the first 20 minutes is done
you just want it all to stop. Please stop. Yet, this is just a
film. Merely images on acetate. And it was only 20 minutes. The
real D-Day invasion battle lasted hours, not minutes. There were no
real bullets penetrating the stadium-seating theater.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that this film allows those who weren't there
to know what it felt like to have experienced D-Day. Baloney. I
knew full well that I could leave at any time. I knew that, at
movie's end, I would most certainly do so. Not one man who waded
ashore at Omaha Beach had that guarantee. Not one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I'm willing to call Speilberg's film a masterpiece of the
first order because he provided us a vision of the hell, if not the
hell itself. That alone is a remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a scene early on in ``Saving Private Ryan'' where the
camera's point of view turns from that of the invading forces to
that of the German army. The camera is positioned just behind one
of those murderous ``88s'' responsible for killing so many men.
</P>
<P>
   The view will send chills up your spine. The 88s had a clear
shot. When the doors opened men were mowed down before they could
take a step. I found myself wondering how anyone got out alive.
Those who landed first paid a dear price.
</P>
<P>
   I had intentionally sat next to my youngest daughter just in
case it was too much, too difficult for her 9-year-old eyes to see.
It was not; an indication of just how desensitized our culture has
left our children.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called this an anti-war film, but I don't believe
that, either. After all, Speilberg, who is a major contributor to
the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., must see World War
II as utterly necessary. But even the most justified war is not
glamorous. As is shown by one character, even the smallest of
actions requires bravery. War is basic survival, trying to kill the
enemy before he kills you and you rarely get a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us adults who have never been in that situation,
``Saving Private Ryan'' gives us more admiration for the sacrifice
of the common soldier. For children, perhaps the movie is enough to
make them think twice about cheering so loudly for Rambo.

 &HT;    Worse than watergate
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along time ago I sat in an audience of newspaper editors at
Disney World, which some would say is an appropriate place for
newspaper editors to meet. Richard Nixon was the speaker. He was
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, against the backdrop of Watergate, that he made
his memorable statement: ``I am not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure he was. Paranoid maybe, but not a crook. Anyway,
Richard Nixon is looking better all the time, by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The way those editor conventions work is they get somebody like
the president or the secretary of state to come and make a talk.
They have microphones set up in the aisles, and after the speaker
finishes speaking editors who want to impress their colleagues go
to the microphones and ask tricky questions they've been crafting
for three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions are very dramatic and show how
intellectual and informed the questioner is. You might have noticed
something similar from the White House press corps and the
Sunday-morning ego eruptions on TV programs hosted by Cokie and
Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nixon had barely finished his talk when one of the editors
strode to an aisle microphone and, in a voice that would do credit
to Ted Koppel, popped his question: ``Mr. President, will the
Republic stand?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was a foolish thing to bring up. Of course the
Republic would stand. It stood through a civil war. It stood
through the Great Depression, two world wars and Prohibition. It
would surely stand through Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody stood up today and asked the same question, I
wouldn't be so quick to brush it off. It seems to me the Republic
is in a lot more trouble now than it was when Nixon was forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   A better question might be: How long can the Republic stand, as
we know it?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think the situation we have in Washington and in
the country today is beyond ridiculous, think back 20 years, even
10, and see if you could have, in your wildest imagination,
conjured up the scenario that today is dominating the news, and the
country. You'd have sworn we had all lost our minds. Maybe we have.
</P>
<P>
   New technology and new morality have taken over and are running
well ahead of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate was just Nixon and a few of his buddies playing dirty
politics and trying to cover their tracks. Right now, I'd be happy
to settle for something simple like Watergate. We fixed that, maybe
too well.
</P>
<P>
   Three New Age inventions have arrived simultaneously in the
nation's capital. Put together, they scare the daylights out of
anyone hoping for another 200 or so good years for the country. The
problem we have in 1998 is multiple:
</P>
<P>
   1. A president from the ``if it feels good it must be good''
generation, who has never grown up.
</P>
<P>
   2. A special prosecutor more powerful than elected officials,
who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   3. A literal army of news reporters and editors, mixed in with
gossip-mongers and other charlatans, working for more TV channels,
stations, networks, newspapers, magazines, and information highway
addresses than a Georgia Tech Phi Beta Kappa can count.
</P>
<P>
   What worries me the most, as one who has come more and more to
appreciate the need to tell the news as it is when it happens, is
that maybe for the first time in the history of the Republic we are
developing a serious First Amendment problem. Can government as we
have known it function with 506 media trucks parked outside the
door while hundreds, even thousands, of reporters clamor for a
instant scoop? What if something like a war comes up?
</P>
<P>
   No, the media didn't cause Bill Clinton to behave like a 1960s
teenager. He's what we get for electing a juvenile delinquent
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true we wouldn't have this mess if Washington
reporters and editors had covered up for Clinton like they did for
John Kennedy when he was making the White House into a facsimile of
a formerly famous Athens institution known as Effie's House of Ill
Repute. However, it's usually best to report the news, even when
the news is bad.
</P>
<P>
   From down here on the farm, with 600 channels floating into our
back yard 24 hours a day and grocery store tabloids helping set the
agenda, it looks as if the problem isn't simply reporting the news,
but rather over-reporting.
</P>
<P>
   All juveniles aren't in the White House. The news business
suffers more than its share.
</P>
<P>
   We get more news than we want, need, or can absorb. Pretty soon
we won't be able to recognize what's news and what isn't. For
example, while we know what kind of drawers the president wears, we
almost forgot to check his tie.
</P>
<P>
   Considering we have a free country, and a public curiosity on
the trashy side, I don't know what can be done to get us back into
a sane zone, short of passing laws we don't want.

 &HT;    Another longing look
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anniversaries are a convenient way of marking our lives, not to
mention reminding us of how nimble time really is. It's been a year
since Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris,
and the event is being marked with a spate of tie-in books.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these are what the trade calls clip jobs, on-the-run
snapshots from a variety of sources, and they hold little interest
beyond their scrapbook nature.
</P>
<P>
   But a few of them have some claim on the readers' attention.
``Diana, Her Life in Fashion'' (Rizzoli, $40) offers a splendid
selection of photographs of the late princess in various gorgeous
outfits, along with behind-the-scenes detail about their design,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Rizzoli book also offers an appendix with bare-bones bios of
the designers _ Conran, Galliano, Valentino and Versace, among
others _ indicating that the book is for the general public rather
than the rag trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana, Portrait of a Princess'' (Simon and Schuster, $35)
takes a broader view, but, read in conjunction with the Rizzoli
book, it's clear that Diana started out dressing as if she was born
to fit in with the reliably dowdy Windsors but unaccountably
developed a superb eye for clothes. Could a sense of style, in and
of itself, contribute to marital estrangement?
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Fincher, the photographer and author of ``Portrait of a
Princess,'' was an official royal photographer, but despite her
access, many of her photos are not appreciably better than those
taken by newspapermen who had to take what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Anderson's ``The Day Diana Died'' (Morrow, $27.50) _
a hilarious title with echoes of the portentous, fly-on-the-wall
tomes that used to be written by Fulton Oursler and Jim Bishop _
relates, in minute by minute detail, what Anderson somehow neglects
to refer to as her date with a tragic destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is a breathless writer of the sort usually to be found
writing for Rupert Murdoch. Breathless, but not hysterical _ no
conspiracies, no pregnancies, just a sad, stupid accident. Like
real life.

   Commentary: Y2K: Bad bug, cool name
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Why 2K?
</P>
<P>
   Does it really take so long to say ``year 2000''? Abbreviations
got us into this mess in the first place and now we expect to fight
back with more of them.
</P>
<P>
   For those still in denial, the Y2K problem -- or Millennium Bug,
except that it happens a year before the new millennium, but let's
not get into that -- is a chain reaction of terrible computer
problems that will kick in when years begin with twos instead of
ones.
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen after 00:01 in the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Planes will show up late at airports and be misscheduled by
people who don't care. ATMs will refuse to work and charge
outrageous fees when they do. VCRs will forlornly flash
12-12-12-12. Chewed gum will drop from under desks and chairs and
onto our shoes. Candy bars will get caught hopelessly in vending
machines. Soda machines will contemptuously spit back dollar bills.
Pens will leak permanent ink. Teenagers will wise-off and wear ugly
shoes. Cats will chase around the room for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the end of the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   For those too sophisticated to believe the world will come to an
end just because warrantees tend to expire when odometers
accumulate zeros, Y2K offers an alternative catastrophe theory.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen mysterious forces will not plunge the world into chaos.
Short-sighted programming will.
</P>
<P>
   That's much better.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has its roots in the way our machines remember
numbers. They often store only two digits. This means that what
they do after 99 is no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists tell of primitive tribes and ancient cultures
whose words for numbers go: one, two, three, many. We laugh at
their simplicity. We have developed to where we can design machines
that count: 1997, 1998, 1999, many.
</P>
<P>
   The two-digit shortcut for four-digit years means when the year
2000 rolls around, some computers will think it's the year 1900.
They will refuse to believe they exist or only accept commands from
operators wearing celluloid collars.
</P>
<P>
   Other machines will think it's the Year 1K and promptly expire
from plague.
</P>
<P>
   For those who take comfort in the belief that our machines are
no smarter than we, this is deeply reassuring. And we make a mental
note to pay for the next year's New Year's dinner in cash before
going home on foot.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, pros are working on the problem. Sure, they
are the same kind of pros who created the problem in the first
place, but let's not get all panicky. There are reasons for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The first sure sign that a solution is on the way is when the
pros develop a snappy name for a problem. So now we have a Y2K
problem. Y is for the year, 2K is for 2,000. This is A Great
Advance.
</P>
<P>
   This is in keeping with the way we attack many of the world's
great challenges. First we worry awhile and identify the problem.
Then, we make insane alarmist predictions about the disruptions and
terrors the problem will cause. Then we give the problem a cool
name. We repeat the cool name until everyone is thoroughly sick of
hearing about it and wants to move onto something else. And then
people stop worrying.
</P>
<P>
   This is how we solved global warming.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe we didn't ``solve'' global warming in the strict sense
of the term, but we sure do worry about it less.
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of the cycle this time is the way people throw
Ks around. K used to be baseball shorthand for a strike. Now it
means 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even nonmetric folks, who would never walk a kilometer if they
could help it, are busily attaching kilos to everything. Folks have
become so cozy with kilos that they have affectionately nicknamed
them Ks. And they use them everywhere. I've heard it 1K times.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that after having so much fun with Y2K, construction
won't go away. The next year will be Y2K1. Then we'll toast Y2K2.
Welcome, class of Y2K3!
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, if course, that it's still an industrialized world
then and everything with a microchip didn't melt when Y1K99 ends.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the end of the world as I know it has been happening on a
near-daily basis for years now. It's hard to get worked up about it
anymore. I'll just make sure the typewriter stays in the closet and
doesn't get thrown out right away.

 &HT;    It takes the right kind of glue
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice of inexperience is always refreshing, especially when
uttered by someone bright enough to ask questions before plundering
headlong into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   From the Internet comes this one: ``I have a set of beechwood
train tracks that I'd like to adhere together in a semi-permanent
fashion. The FAQ for woodworking states that hot glue is probably
not a good adhesive except for `building forms or jigs.' Since I'm
a non-woodworker, I'm not exactly sure what that means. Basically,
I'm looking for an adhesive that will keep the pieces `stable,' but
will be fairly easy to remove when I want to add to the set in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that rubber cement might work, but I'm worried
about marring the finish or damaging the wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is more of a `toy' question, but in reading
through this group's FAQ and recent posts, you obviously know a
heck of a lot more about wood adhesives, so I figured I'd take a
shot here.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of you not up to your hips in the Internet, FAQ means
a list of answers to Frequently Asked Questions. It's little wonder
this gentlemen didn't get any satisfaction there; his is scarcely a
frequently asked question. And for those of you who, like this
inquirer, aren't woodworkers, ``forms and jigs'' are shopmade
devices used to speed or otherwise aid in construction.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the rec.woodworking FAQ is referring to the kind
of hot glue you squeeze out of little electric glue guns, and it's
right. This stuff generally is going to come apart on its own; only
in the rarest instance would I use hot glue for these purposes,
unless I needed the thing to cure immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Hide glue, which is applied hot, is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hide glue has been used for centuries to make furniture, and
obviously it works quite well. In fact, enough furniture-makers
still use hide glue to keep it in production. You can buy hide glue
pellets, and the purpose-made double boilers used to heat it, at
any woodworking supply house.
</P>
<P>
   For all those centuries, of course, there wasn't any other glue.
In terms of general ease of use and durability, hide glue was
supplanted by today's modern synthetic glues, aliphatic resin
(Titebond) plastic resin and polyurethane. The thing that keeps
hide glue going is the fact that joints secured with it can be
taken apart with the application of moist heat. This is why
antiques can be restored _ failing joints can be taken apart
without damage, cleaned up, repaired and put back together again.
You can't do that with modern glue.
</P>
<P>
   The use of hide glue is not something for amateurs. You can
stink up a shop big time if you burn it, and it has to be just the
right consistency to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm not sure that any kind of glue is going to do what
this gentleman requires. Now I have never seen wooden train tracks
that had a finish on them. Obviously, if there is any kind of
finish on the wood, glue won't work. Glue will not adhere
successfully to a finish. Even if it would adhere well enough to
meet the specification here, it would make a mess when removed.
</P>
<P>
   If used on bare wood, any kind of semi-permanent glue is going
to leave some residue which would have to be cleaned off before
regluing.
</P>
<P>
   So, why use glue at all?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how these pieces of track connect, nor am I sure to
what degree stress will be applied to them. But if their problem
was mine, I'd try taping them together. There are all kinds of
excellent tapes on the market, single and double sided. For
starters, there's that great old standby, duct tape.

 &HT;    Low-budget love story amiable, predictable
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erin Castleton doesn't ask for much. She just wants a guy who
isn't a jerk and who maybe, just maybe, knows that it was Ralph
Waldo Emerson who observed that ``consistency is the hobgoblin of
little minds.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't ask for much, either. We just want a romantic comedy
with characters worth caring about for a couple of hours, written
with enough skill and filmed with enough style to set it apart from
the crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   Since that seems too much to ask, we might as well settle for
``Next Stop Wonderland,'' a pleasant enough low-budget love story
that travels all too familiar ground. Co-written, directed and
edited by Brad Anderson and discovered by Miramax at this year's
Sundance Festival, it follows two made-for-each-other contemporary
Bostonians who remain apart by barely one degree of separation
until the film's final moments. No wonder it is touted as an East
Coast ``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin (Hope Davis of ``The Daytrippers,'' looking an awful lot
like a young Hillary Clinton) is a night-shift nurse whose flaky
boyfriend walks out on her, leaving behind a videocassette of his
grievances. Her high-powered mother (Holland Taylor) throws her
back into the dating pool by taking out a personals ad for Erin.
This triggers a montage of date-from-hell encounters with geeks,
nerds, liars and the Emerson-impaired. It's funny stuff, but such
well-trodden territory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just blocks away is Alan Monteiro (Alan Gelfant), a
plumber who yearns to be a marine biologist. While going to school,
he works at the Boston Aquarium, but they are more interested in
his mastery of a monkey wrench than his fascination with all
creatures scaled and finned.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a definite wrench into the movie is a hard-to-swallow
subplot about Alan taking a college loan from mobsters. He falls
behind in payments and gets pressured to cause mayhem with the
tropical fish so an evil developer (Robert Klein, no less) can halt
an aquarium addition. Romantic comedies require some suspension of
disbelief, but this pushes the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis and Gelfant float above such flaws, and we do find
ourselves rooting for them. She is surprisingly likable,
considering that she has to play a character going through life
with a wary, sullen disposition. His character is a little too good
to be true, but Gelfant manages to make him credible. The built-in
problem with the movie, as with ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' is that
we want to see more of them together.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while to get used to Anderson's jittery
camerawork, as if he were underlining that this was all done on the
cheap. But he eventually relaxes into the story, as we do.
``Wonderland'' must surely be a Lewis Carroll allusion, but it's
also a Boston subway stop. Anderson lovingly shows off some of the
lesser-known sights of Beantown, doing for the city what Woody
Allen repeatedly does for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop Wonderland'' wants to say something profound about
fate, destiny and star-crossed lovers. Of course, it doesn't, but
chances are that most moviegoers will settle instead for its
feel-good position on romance.

 &HT;    Fiery Queso gives 'em the heat
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Tom and Pam Stanley make queso, they pump
the peppers to it: jalapeno, habanero, chipotle, fingerhot and
serranos. Their Fiery Queso singes.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the heat brought enough pleasure that five judges
declared it the grand prize winner of the Quest for Queso at the
Texas Fiery Foods Show recently at Palmer Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hot fan, and I liked its texture and flavor,'' said
Jennifer Grissom of Birmingham, a food service consultant for
Southern Living and one of the judges. ``But it's too hot for the
general public, `` she conceded. ``I would serve the Tres Chiles
con Queso at my home for a party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tres Chiles con Queso, made with only three peppers, was one
of the four finalists, along with a queso dotted with shrimp and a
two-ingredient queso of salsa and Velveeta. However, in a very
close contest, with nearly every judge having a distinct
preference, the Fiery Queso edged out the competition when the
numbers were tallied, winning a gift basket of hundreds of dollars
of fiery food products.
</P>
<P>
   For newcomers to Texas, queso is short for the Spanish words
chile con queso (kohn KAY soh), which translates to chile with
cheese. Texans claim it as their own. But Diana Kennedy in ``The
Cuisines of Mexico'' says, ``I had always thought of chile con
queso as a Texas dish until I went to Chihuahua. It is eaten there
as a vegetable with broiled meats, and it is also served as an
appetizer with hot tortillas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, queso, which is usually more cheese than chiles, is
scooped up by the chipful at parties and ball games galore. It is
poured on baked potatoes, french fries, broccoli and burgers. It is
comfort food. It is good. It is contest worthy. And it comes in
many variations, some mild, some hot.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stanley, an electrical project manager and the family chef,
was a little surprised that his Fiery Queso won. ``We weren't real
proud of this batch, `` he said of the 20-year-old, ever-evolving
recipe. Peppers vary so much, he explained. But that was Tom
talking. Pam thought the queso was perfect. However, both
acknowledge that it is hot.
</P>
<P>
   When Pam , an accounts examiner for the State Comptroller's
Office, takes a gallon batch to work, half the people tell her it's
too hot. ``But it's gone before lunch,'' she says with a smile. And
one of those colleagues told her about the queso contest and talked
her into entering.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the TexasFiery Foods Show and Central Market, the
contest failed to attract a large number of entries. Perhaps it was
because it was the first year of the contest and the word did not
get out to queso cooks, or because there was no big-bucks prize.
Then, again, maybe the contest got lost in all the end-of-summer,
back-to-school activities. Whatever the reasons, fewer than 10
Austinites were willing to divulge their queso recipes for the
competition, a low response in a city where queso is one of four
main dips.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the sponsors elected to go forth with the
competition because the entries they received were so diverse and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Mozzarella, cream cheese, American white cheese, Velveeta,
asadero _ all found their way into the final preparations, some of
which were smooth and some stringy because of the nature of the
specific cheeses. ``It's hard to compare the various quesos because
of the differences in the cheeses,'' observed judge Michael Flores,
a chef from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Queso con Camerones (shrimp), for instance, would be great
in a tortilla, like a queso fundido, said Flores, referring to a
popular appetizer frequently seen in Mexican restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp queso was a favorite of judge Sam Higgins, Ro-Tel
spokesman, cooking teacher and author of ``I'm Glad I Ate When I
Did 'Cause I'm Not Hungry Now'' and ``Snake, Rattle &AMP; Ro-Tel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to eat a whole bowl, Queso con Camerones is the
only one I would touch,'' said Higgins, cleansing his palate with a
Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the traditional Ro-Tel/Velveeta queso, a mainstay in
Central Texas, most of these quesos were made with white cheeses
and various chiles. Only one, the entry of 12-year old Kevin Neal
Lewis, blended a convenience product with a block of cheese in the
Texas two-step style. And this savvy young cook's convenience
product was not the Ro-Tel combo of tomatoes and green chiles but
salsa, specifically Austin Slow Burn, manufactured by his parents
Kevin and Jill Lewis. Simple and different enough to get him in the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   But are their quesos the best in Lone Star land?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you will have to be the judge of that. Make one and see if
it's better than yours. Fiery Queso
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds white American cheese

 &HT;    Community bonds over whale's survival
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEWALL'S POINT, Fla. _ An off-duty Martin County sheriff's
deputy, boaters and teenagers came to the aid of a sick pygmy sperm
whale that beached itself on the south side of the Stuart Causeway
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a whale strand in the Indian River before,''
said Erik Martin of Ecological Associates, head of the local marine
mammal stranding network. ``It's a freak thing. The whale must have
come in the (Stuart) inlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin contacted the National Marine Fisheries Service in Miami,
which planned to send a team to pick up the whale and take it to a
rehabilitation facility in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Glenn Foss, who works at the sheriff's boot camp for
juvenile offenders, said he was eating lunch at the causeway about
2 p.m. when he saw the 10-foot whale, a female, thrashing in the
shallow water. Sharp rocks left cuts all over her body.
</P>
<P>
   Foss wrestled with the whale, pulling it into deeper water so he
could hold it upright, and waved down Pat McCafferty and Tom
Santori of Port St. Lucie, who were planning to launch their boat.
The three held the 800- to 1,000-pound whale steady, and soon were
joined by Krista Mendes and Rachel Sumner, both 14, and Rachel's
dad, John, all of Palm City.
</P>
<P>
   The crew held the whale for nearly three hours. Other passersby
waded out to relieve them. The deputy wouldn't leave his position
near the whale's head, holding her blowhole out of the water and
dodging the spray when she breathed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a commercial diver in Louisiana,'' Foss said. ``I
love whales _ and any sea creature.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was not hopeful the whale would survive. ``Usually those
that strand are in bad shape to begin with,'' he said. ``Most don't
even make it to the rehabilitation facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Foss continually stroked and patted the whale's scarred head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sorta feel responsible for her,'' he said. ``I don't want to
leave her. It's amazing how you get attached to something.''

 &HT;    Miami rookies take orders, not abuse, they say
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ If you go by the Webster's definition _ ``to
harass with silly, disagreeable or demeaning tasks'' _ then, yes,
the Miami Dolphins' rookies have experienced hazing during training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   They have to bring buckets of chicken for the veterans to eat on
plane flights. They have to get used to being called ``Rook.'' And
they have to be prepared to treat their teammates to music _ and
we're not necessarily talking about standing up and singing during
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that,'' first-round pick John Avery said, pointing out a
stack of new stereo equipment sitting in an empty locker. ``I had
to buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dolphins' rookies insist they do not have to do anything
resembling what happened in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Cam Cleeland, a rookie tight end for the Saints, was injured in
a hazing incident. He and four other draft picks reportedly were
forced to put pillowcases over their heads and run a gantlet of
veterans. According to Cleeland's agent, the veterans hit the
rookies with bags of coins. Cleeland suffered damage to his left
eye and may have had his nose broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Avery said. ``When it gets to the point
when you're actually inflicting pain on another player, I think it
has more to do with jealousy. That's wrong. I don't understand
that. . . . Calling you rookie, making you bring chicken, that's
all in good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins cornerback Patrick Surtain, the team's second-round
pick, has paid close attention to the Saints' incident. He grew up
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me because that's a bunch of adults,'' he said. ``
. . . There's nothing like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookies say the most serious threat is a dunking in the
``cold tank'' _ a whirlpool of 45-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done it, because, well, I'm obedient,'' Avery
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the airport for last weekend's trip to San
Francisco, Avery had to swing through a drive-through and order 500
chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Avery's wallet has taken the biggest hit, although after
signing a five-year, $5.5 million deal he should be able to afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone dreads hazing. When Dolphins receiver Lamar Thomas
was a Tampa Bay rookie, he and another former Hurricane, Horace
Copeland, were told to sing to the crowd assembled for a practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved it,'' Thomas said. ``They had to take the microphones
away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Latest additions: The Dolphins claimed three players off
waivers Wednesday: wide receivers Nate Jacquet and Phil Savoy, and
tight end Hendrick Lusk.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet, a former San Diego State player, was the highest draft
pick of the three. Indianapolis made him a fifth-round pick in
1997. He spent the first nine games of the 1997 season on the
practice squad, was inactive for two games, then saw limited action
in the final five games.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy, who was released by Arizona, was a seventh-round draft
pick out of Colorado this season. He finished his college career
ranked second on the school's all-time list for receptions (152).
</P>
<P>
   For Lusk, this will be his fifth NFL stop in less than three
years. He started his career in New Orleans in 1986 as a
seventh-round draft pick out of Utah. He caught 27 passes for 210
yards that season, but was released the following summer. The Jets
claimed him off waivers, then traded him to Green Bay. Before he
played a game with the Packers, they released him. He had signed
with Washington on Dec. 31, 1997, but was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The addition increased the Dolphins' roster to 61 players. They
are allowed to go over the 60-player limit because of two
exemptions _ defensive tackle Tim Bowens, who held out the first 27
days, and Damon Huard, who spent the summer in the World League.

 &HT;    Out of garage, into NFL for punter Wilmsmeyer
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The top line of Klaus Wilmsmeyer's bio is simple
and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   1997 _ Was out of football.
</P>
<P>
   And while that technically is correct _ for the first time since
he was a young boy in Mississauga, Ontario, Wilmsmeyer was indeed
out of the game _ it doesn't tell you what he was in.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we offer a revised bio.
</P>
<P>
   1997 _ Was in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmsmeyer, who officially won the Miami Dolphins' punting job
when John Kidd was cut, did his kicking in 1997 in the garage of
his Louisville home.
</P>
<P>
   To explain how he ended up there, standing on a patch of carpet
set down on concrete, booting ball after ball into a net, you have
to go back to this time last year and the day a doctor told him,
``You can't play football; the risk is too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmsmeyer had been gearing up to start what he hoped would be
his sixth NFL season and his third with the New Orleans Saints. He
had competition in camp, but his primary concern was his own body,
specifically his back.
</P>
<P>
   It had been bothering him since he arrived in New Orleans in
1995. And it had gotten worse during a busy 1996 _ a career-high 87
punts, including 10 in one game against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up for camp in 1997 without a contract and with hopes
that his back would get better. It didn't. So he decided to have an
MRI done. And that is when the doctor gave him the news: He had a
herniated disc in his back that made playing football inadvisable.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home to Louisville, where he and his wife, Deborah,
had settled following his college career as a punter and
place-kicker for the University of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited a couple months before making a decision,'' he said.
``Finally, I said, `I'm going to try and play again.'''
</P>
<P>
   He found a surgeon in Louisville who specialized in back
surgery, had an operation he hoped would solve the problem, then,
three months later, began kicking again.
</P>
<P>
   In his garage.
</P>
<P>
   It was winter in Kentucky, so he couldn't do it outside.
Instead, he spent $350 and bought a kicking net to set up.
</P>
<P>
   In his garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a 14-foot ceiling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't exactly a comfortable setting. The air was cold
and, even with the carpeting, the footing was slippery. In other
words, it was a little like Soldier Field in late November.
</P>
<P>
   But his back felt better. And if that wasn't enough incentive,
there was the statistic he kept hearing when he turned on the TV on
Sunday and sat there watching NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying that half the punters in the league were over
30,'' he said. ``Teams were having a hard time finding young
kickers who could directional punt or pooch punt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilmsmeyer could point to what he did in 1995. He began that
year in Pro Player Stadium, punting in Super Bowl XXIX for the San
Francisco 49ers. Then, after the 49ers decided not to tender him a
minimum qualifying offer, he became a free agent and signed with
New Orleans. And in his first season with the Saints, he put 21
kicks inside the 20-yard line and only five in the end zone _ an
NFC-best ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he signed with Miami on Feb. 23, he seemed like a
long shot to make the team. Kidd had held the job for four years,
establishing himself as the team's all-time punting leader (a
44.2-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   Then training camp brought an ironic twist. A bad back. Only it
wasn't his bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd missed the first three season games with back pain, and the
battle for the job came down to a trip to 3Com Park _ the place
where Wilmsmeyer spent three seasons battling the swirling winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to get back,'' Wilmsmeyer said, ``but nobody likes
kicking at Candlestick. It's a tough place to keep a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but it is where Wilmsmeyer won his new job.
</P>
<P>
   His four kicks averaged 49.5 yards. Kidd's four kicks averaged
41.5 yards. Tuesday, the Dolphins made the decision to keep the guy
whose family tree starts in Europe _ his parents are from Germany _
but has traces of Canada and Kentucky in his accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things went into the decision,'' special teams coach
Mike Westhoff said. ``But Klaus just kicked John.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe now Wilmsmeyer can take his life out of the holding
pattern it has been stuck in for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   They had kept the house in Louisville. His wife, a high school
teacher, hadn't told her school whether she would be back this
fall. And Wilmsmeyer was holding on to his season tickets for
University of Louisville football games, hoping that he wouldn't be
able to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there was some added incentive to make it back to the NFL
_ a baby girl named Kasey Nicole Wilmsmeyer born on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big motivation,'' he said, glancing at her picture
in his locker and explaining that the goal was to be able to afford
to have Deborah stay home and take care of Kasey.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFL is a fickle anything-can-happen business, it
looks like that will be possible.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like when this year is finished, it will be time to add
a new line to his bio.
</P>
<P>
   1998 _ Out of the garage ... back in football.

   Colonias hit by flood
</P>
<P>
   By Ben Wear
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As floodwaters threatened to wash away hundreds
of modest homes in Rio Bravo and El Cenizo, about 800 women and
children headed to the safety of nearby shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But many of their husbands and fathers remained behind, to guard
what few possessions they own against looters _ efforts that might
be futile in light of the rising Rio Grande. Aurora Gonzales, 44,
waited pensively at the United D.D. Hachar Elementary School gym,
praying that her husband's efforts wouldn't be in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lost everything, I don't know what we'd do,'' Gonzales
said through an interpreter. ``We've lived there 12 years, and the
house took that long to build.'' Rio Bravo and El Cenizo are
colonias _ substandard developments built about 20 years ago, when
inadequate regulations and poor enforcement allowed developers to
carve up parcels for poor people eager to buy a piece of the
American dream but unable to afford better.
</P>
<P>
   These homes, in a remote area of mesquite trees and prickly pear
cactus about 15 miles south of Laredo, are simple structures of
wood and stucco. They could not be built legally today because they
lie in the Rio Grande's 100-year flood plain. Fortunately for the
homeowners, they can still be legally refurbished if floodwaters
cause severe damage, Webb County planning director Rhonda Tiffin
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rebuilding is not an easy option for most residents. The
reason: They cannot afford it. A 1997 state survey of El Cenizo
found that the average household income was $10,800 a year. What is
more, no one has federal flood insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners could be barred from rebuilding at the same location
only if the flood carries a home away or destroys it completely.
Then, Tiffin said, a 1997 agreement between a federal agency and
Webb County _ which owns and runs the systems for the colonias _
would prevent hooking new or reconstructed homes to the systems.
The systems are inadequate, and county officials are planning to
apply to the Texas Water Development Board for about $20 million to
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffin said the county would be unlikely to approve subdivision
plats with homes in the 100-year flood plain _ an area that has a 1
percent chance of being flooded in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   State law has changed since the colonias' early days as well,
making it impossible to build a sewage-treatment plant in the flood
plain. El Cenizo's sewage goes to a small plant that lies about a
hundred yards from the Rio Grande. Webb County utilities director
Tomas M. Rodriguez Jr., whose department inherited the ill-sited
plant some years ago, said it is unlikely that this flood will get
high enough to cause a spill or shutdown at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   When the colonias were established, the land was in an
unincorporated section of Webb County. The developer who sold the
lots was not bound by city subdivision requirements that might have
banned building in the flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Bravo, which has about 5,000 residents, and El Cenizo, with
about 3,000, incorporated in 1989. Tiffin said the developer
encouraged incorporation because Laredo had moved far enough south
that the colonias fell within its extraterritorial jurisdiction,
meaning Laredo could have exercised some control over building.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the river was rising more slowly than expected,
and it was not certain whether the colonias would be flooded at
all. That didn't quell the fears of many residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said her husband, who works as an aide in a nursing
home in Laredo, could not afford to replace their home if it is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   San Juana Castorena, 24, who lives with her two young daughters
in El Cenizo, said she and her extended family _ including her
parents and sister and brother _ all live within blocks of each
other, and the river. If floodwaters destroy one house, it's likely
all will be affected. And none of her family, she said, could
afford to rebuild from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would all be homeless,'' she said. ``That's exactly what
would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some relief could be available, though. A proposed settlement in
federal bankruptcy court calls for the Texas Department of Housing
and Community Affairs to earmark nearly $2 million for housing
improvements in El Cenizo. That commitment would stand regardless
of flooding, said Heather Tindall, a spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the housing agency often provides grants to
communities damaged by natural disasters, and the two colonias
would be no exception, provided that a state or federal disaster
were declared, said Homero Cabello, director of colonia initiatives
for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The news that they could fix flood-damaged homes likely will be
small comfort to Rio Bravo and El Cenizo homeowners. None have
flood insurance because neither the colonias or Webb County
participate in the national flood insurance program run by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an area's government participates, homeowners can't get
flood insurance. And without insurance, money for large-scale
repairs will be difficult to scrape up for the mostly poor
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Bravo Mayor Feliciano Garcia said the city might be able to
help, using unspecified and so far uncommitted state or federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffin said FEMA has money for relocation, but only to
participating cities.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, said help from several
federal programs would be available if the governor declares Laredo
a major disaster area.

 &HT;    Price for grapefruit groves plunges 25%
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. While the value of land used to grow
citrus continues to fall statewide, grapefruit growers have been
hardest hit, according to a survey by the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The value of grapefruit groves in the southern part of the state
fell 25 percent to $3,035 an acre this year, while the value for
orange groves fell less than 6 percent to $6,882 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been particularly rough for the grapefruit people,'' said
Clayton Hutcheson, director of the university's Cooperative
Extension Service in Palm Beach County. ``Nobody wants to buy a
grapefruit grove,'' he said, ``because nobody can get returns from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices growers get for grapefruit have fallen sharply since the
early 1990s, primarily because growers over-planted grapefruit
trees after freezes in the late 1980s cut into supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an 85-pound box of grapefruit that brought an
average of $6.62 in 1992 went for an average of $1.23 last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are 95,735 acres of oranges and 61,622 acres of grapefruit
grown in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the seventh consecutive year citrus land values
have declined, the value of farmland easily converted to
nonagricultural use remains high in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey, scheduled to be released next week, divides
the state into south, central, northeast and northwest regions. It
breaks out southeast Florida _ Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade
counties _ to measure transitional land values.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the southeast region's ``transitional'' farmland _
acreage likely to be converted to home sites or commercial
development _ is triple what it is in other parts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the value of transitional land within 5 miles of a
major town in the southeast region was $28,000 an acre as of May
1998, compared with $9,213 an acre in the northwest region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's due to the higher intensity of development and the higher
population density,'' said John Reynolds, the professor of food and
resource economics who conducts the study.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' Florida Land Value Survey has estimated the market
value for different types of rural land since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Survey respondents include property appraisers, farm managers,
real estate investors, county extension agents and others who
gather information about rural land values.

   Laredo hit hard by flooding
</P>
<P>
   By Cara Tanamachi and Ben Wear
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fear turned into skeptism among residents here
as the forecasted raging floodwaters of the Rio Grande arrived in
Laredo as a sluggish rise, seeping close to, but not into, nearby
homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, August 26, river levels at International Bridge
No. 1 near downtown Laredo were about 31.5 feet, and officials
predicted the waters would peak near 35 feet between 9 p.m. and
midnight and hold that level for 12 hours. Flooding begins at 8
feet.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of deaths or injuries in the Laredo area
from the river's rise, a result of heavy rains upstream spawned by
Tropical Storm Charley. The death toll from Charley's remnants in
southwest Texas and northern Mexico stood at 13 _ six in Del Rio,
four in Real County and three in Ciudad Acun(tilde)a, across the
border from Del Rio. A man who died of a heart attack in Uvalde
County while being evacuated from rising water was not officially
listed as a flood victim because his death was not caused directly
by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted widely scattered showers
and thunderstorms across the Rio Grande, San Antonio, Guadalupe and
Nueces river basins through the rest of the week. However, no major
rainfall that would cause renewed flooding are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials advised residents of Del Rio and other
flood-stricken areas to wash hands carefully, to avoid food that
might have been contaminated and to drink water only if it was
bottled or served by a shelter. There have been no reports of
cholera, hepatitis A, gastrointestinal illness and other disorders,
said Chip Riggins, a physician with the Texas Department of Health
who was dispatched to Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Eagle Pass, between Del Rio and Laredo, some
downtown businesses and about 10 homes _ including the home of
Mayor Pepe Aranda _ were flooded, but there were no fatalities or
injuries. City officials weren't aware of any other property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the predawn hours Wednesday in Laredo, the water rose as
quickly as 3 inches a minute. But by mid-morning, it slowed to less
than 1 inch per minute, or just under a foot an hour. By noon, the
river had crested near 45 feet _ more than 5 feet higher than
expected _ at the Colombia-Solidarity Bridge, about 30 miles
upstream from downtown. That sent panic through some neighborhoods
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Officials worried that the river could crest in Laredo much
sooner than expected, even by morning. But by late Wedneday, as the
Rio Grande continued its slow rise, officials estimated the river
would not peak until sometime overnight, and no higher than 35
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, fearing looters, insisted on staying with their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have everything packed up, but I'm not leaving until I see
water at my porch,'' said Ruth Gonzalez, 46, who lives less than a
block from Zacate Creek, one of two tributaries of the Rio Grande
in Laredo and an area officials advised residents to leave Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on her porch late Wednesday afternoon, in view of the
creek. Gonzalez and her husband, Javier Sanchez Gonzalez, packed
most of their wordly belongings into the back of a pickup truck,
which sat on the street in front of their home, facing higher
ground and ready to go if water threatens.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio Bravo and El Cenizo, two colonias south of Laredo, where
officials Tuesday had predicted the floodwaters would hit hardest,
the river early Wednesday evening was still 25 feet from the first
row of houses.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters for the colonias' residents filled Wednesday with more
than 800 people _ mainly women and children _ who fled homes during
the night as emergency officials went door to door advising them to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   On either side of the river, spectators gathered to watch the
rising tide. And despite the best efforts of police, many crept
close enough to the water's edge to fling fishing nets. Some walked
away with large fish _ a dinner best not eaten, said officials,
since the water is heavily polluted with debris ranging from snakes
and tree limbs to dead livestock, including goats and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   In central Laredo, at the command center for fire and rescue
teams, emergency workers coordinated evacuation efforts and a
specially trained rapid water rescue team stood by.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime Wednesday, a man was spotted attempting to swim in
the river, and the rescue team went out into the swift-moving,
debris-filled river on a hovercraft, according to officials. The
man, however, made it safely on his own to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Fire Captain Alfonso Perez, Jr., who led the water rescue
effort, said navigating the waters overnight, when the waters are
expected to crest, will be far more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to maneuver around trees, dead cattle, furniture,
whatever might be out there,'' he said. ``We have lights, but you
can only see so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials hoped most residents would leave long before
nightfall Wednesday. Evacuations, most but not all of them
voluntary, began early Wednesday in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Howard Johnsons 15-story tower, with a
million-dollar view of the river west of downtown, were roused from
bed about 6:30 a.m. and told to find other lodgings. Police visited
the Santa Rita neighborhood in southeast Laredo, a low-lying area
downstream of downtown, and made a non-binding request for
residents on Pamplona Loop, the street closest to the river, to
evacuate. Most did.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Salazar, whose family lives in a two-story on Pamplona,
spent most of the night on his roof with binoculars looking at the
rising water. He was still here around 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait to leave until it reaches the street,''
Salazar, 29, said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, the Laredo Food Bank, which sits about a
block and a half from the Rio Grande, moved out supplies of food as
a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of flooding in Laredo, the relief center at the
Laredo Civic Center was not seeing much business.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Cisneros, Jr., a city health department employee
stationed there, said he had posted about 150 visitors since the
center opened Tuesday at 7 p.m., but that some of the names were
repeat visitors who had left to retrieve belongings when the flood
didn't arrive on schedule and then returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a lot of these were from Nuevo Laredo,'' Cisneros said.
``They got stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   In the colonias south of Laredo, Department of Public Safety
patrol officiers controlled traffic to areas nearest the river and
refused to let people return to evacuated neighborhoods until after
the floodwaters pass.
</P>
<P>
   All three bridges connecting Laredo and Mexcio remained closed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Garza, director of the U.S. Customs office in Laredo, said
the city of Laredo already had inspectors checking the
Columbia-Solidarity Bridge upstream and might open it either late
Wednesday or early today. About half of the 6,000 trucks that cross
at Laredo each day typically use the Columbia-Solidarity Bridge in
normal circumstances, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   City of Laredo spokesman Marco Alvarado said there's no way to
predict when the two downtown bridges might reopen. He said the
company had hired Brown &AMP; Root, an engineering company from
Houston, to study the structural integrity of the bridges after the
water ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   Customs spokeswoman Judy Turner said cross-border shippers in
some cases may opt to take their loads across at McAllen or Eagle
Pass, given the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   As evening neared, the water's edge likewise approached River
Drive Mall. At 31 feet, the river would begin to seep under the
mall's doors fronting the appropriately named Water Street.

 &HT;    NCR donates product archive to history museum
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Industrialist John H. Patterson liked to boast that wherever men
traded, a National cash register was tracking the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer on the NCR payroll often was not far behind,
making images of the famous, Dayton-made machinery in remote places
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Those images _ 400,000 photographic negatives on glass from 1895
forward _ are among the treasures NCR announced that it will lend
to the Montgomery County Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hackett, executive director of the historical society,
called the NCR archive ``an exceptionally rare and valuable piece
of our history. The NCR archive, better than any other single
collection in the Miami Valley, is the keeper of who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative move, described by NCR and historical society
officials as a partnership that will improve community access to
the company's archive, should assure that the priceless collection
of photographs, slides, drawings, corporate papers, machinery and
furniture will remain in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Merz, an historical society trustee, said it also could
encourage other Miami Valley corporations to turn over their
archives to a more public venue.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Nyberg, chairman and CEO of NCR Corp., and Hackett
announced the agreement on a two-year loan that would be followed
by a renewable, 10-year agreement for historical society management
of the archive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partnership will keep our archive intact and make it more
broadly available to the community for display and research,''
Nyberg said in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the historical society to prepare an
inventory, develop a management plan and arrange a public exhibit
of archive items sometime next year. The society also must conduct
a fund-raising campaign to find a permanent location for the
archive and set up a digital library of the negatives and slides.
</P>
<P>
   NCR may invest up to $2 million in the project over 12 years,
Nyberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he was not prepared to announce details of the
fund-raiser. The society has long been overcrowded in its principal
location, the Old Court House at Third and Main streets.
</P>
<P>
   The NCR archive, stored at 1529 Brown St., is not a secret.
Images from it have appeared in local histories and television
programs. Limited use has been allowed to graduate students and
other researchers. But it has remained invisible to the general
public. An NCR spokesman said the agreement does not mean the
archive will be immediately open to the public on a regular basis.

 &HT;    Computer realizes dream of man with palsey
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For maybe 20 years, Scott Meece imagined a wondrous day when he
could write by talking to a computer and read by listening to it
speak. Cerebral palsy, limiting his vision and dexterity, had
trapped his intelligence in a world where books and pencils were
not adequate for communicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, 'Wouldn't it be neat to have something you
could talk to and it would write down what you tell it?' '' Meece
says. ``I never thought it would really be available.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Meece has a computer setup that talks and listens. It still
costs $5,000, and the voice-recognition software has more bugs than
a windshield after a day on the highway, but the system is much
better than $25,000 would have bought just four years ago, says
Randy Tompkins, who trains people to use these adaptive technology
tools at the Technology Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   The device enables Meece to work as a consultant for the RTA,
where he trains bus drivers in accommodating handicapped
passengers. ``He's getting paid, and he's paying taxes,'' says Pat
Cashdollar, TRC's program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed my life dramatically,'' says Meece, who is
expressing his gratitude by rounding up corporate sponsors for
TRC's only major fund raiser. The Trek for Tech Run/Walk on
Saturday morning is still looking for sponsors and participants.
</P>
<P>
   Cashdollar and Terry Traske founded TRC 14 years ago in search
of synthetic voices for their disabled children who were unable to
talk. The organization is dedicated to enabling people with
disabilities, especially those that inhibit visual or vocal
communication.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a lending library of adaptive technology so people
can try out the expensive gadgets before spending hundreds or
thousands of dollars on them.
</P>
<P>
   TRC is best known for its joint venture with the Dayton
Microcomputer Association to refurbish donated computers and
recycle them to people with disabilities, students at risk and the
economically disadvantaged. But the core of its mission is the more
than 1,500 people a year it helps with ways to overcome paralysis,
blindness, muteness and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It fits donated toys with toggle switches and pedals so, for
example, a child can turn an elephant's trunk into a squirt-gun
nozzle without moving his fingers. It has on-screen keyboards for
people who can't type but can move a trackball or use a pointer
attached to the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   For those with even more limited ability, computers scan the
alphabet or other choices on a monitor until a person clicks on
one. People can use them to turn the lights on or the heat down.
</P>
<P>
   TRC's clients are split evenly between children and adults,
birth defects and injuries or illnesses, Cashdollar says. Among the
most enthusiastic are those who are losing the use of their eyes or
their limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Now products for the disabled are the proving ground for the
voice-recognition technology coveted in many industries. ``It's
still highly overrated,'' Cashdollar says. When Meece says ``This
is a test'' into a new headset, the computer displays ``This is a
death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meece can override those garbles with his keyboard or mouse,
and his own software actually has learned some of his pronunciation
patterns. He says he was overcome with joy the first time he was
able to write a letter to a friend and read the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being married to the computer,'' Meece says. ``I
turn to it when I'm frustrated, when I'm happy, when I'm sad. It
really is my partner.''

 &HT;    Davis glad to put away other hats
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Finally, Butch Davis feels like a
football coach and nothing but a football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Just more than a week away from beginning his fourth season at
the University of Miami and less than an hour before his Hurricanes
scrimmaged against themselves in Lockhart Stadium, Davis sat on an
aluminum bench several rows up in the stands and . . . exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most enjoyable time since we've been here has been the
last six months, because it's the first time all our energies are
devoted to the development of the team,'' Davis said. ``There's an
anticipation that something good is going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, the first three years what we were doing was a
Band-Aid effect. You asked yourself, `What did you have to do to
stop the bleeding this day, this game, on and off the field.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The abridged version of the ugly history is Davis, upon taking
the job in 1995, found himself saddled with NCAA sanctions as a
result of earlier Miami transgressions. The Hurricanes, as a result
of residual talent, escaped with 8-3 and 9-3 records during Davis'
first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's 5-6 record was Miami's first losing mark since
1979.
</P>
<P>
   A shadow of what they were
</P>
<P>
   All of which, by circuitous route, brought Davis and the
Hurricanes up I-95 from their digs in Coral Gables for Wednesday
night's activity. The first day of classes allowed Davis to take
practice on the road, so he did.
</P>
<P>
   The stated reason? Miami wanted to show off its team for fans in
Broward Country and perhaps draw a few from Palm Beach County as
well. A PR exercise, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken reason? The Hurricanes need to do a sales job on
themselves because their Orange Bowl home has looked too empty too
often lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the motivating factor,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that Miami, which once cast a monstrous shadow
itself (remember all those national championships?), now lives in
the shadows of in-state bullies Florida and Florida State while
aftershocks of the NCAA sanctions still rumble beneath the
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, for example, doesn't expect to reach the full complement
of 85 scholarship players until next season. He does, however, feel
better equipped to deal with the team's Big East schedule and a
non-conference slate highlighted by games against UCLA and
aforementioned Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, for example, will not feature 29 true or
redshirt freshmen among the 44 players on their two-deep offensive
and defensive charts as they did last season.
</P>
<P>
   But they will, by Davis' own estimate, have only five seniors
who contribute in any significant manner.
</P>
<P>
   In for the long haul
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've tremendously improved,'' Davis said. ``The
reality is that the last year has been a healing process, and
that's going to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there hasn't been an assortment of misbehavior by
various Hurricanes during Davis' tenure, but the faith and feeling
is the NCAA and/or police blotters no longer will be primary
concerns. So it was that Miami, listed just ahead of Wake Forest in
the others-receiving-votes category of one pre-season poll and just
behind Oklahoma State in another, took its act up the South Florida
coast for an evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got loyalty to the kids I've sold my commitment to,''
Davis said. ``When you put your heart and soul into trying to make
a change, it's difficult to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   He's feeling like a football coach again. Finally.

mainstream and safe, with enough country flourishes like an

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BY my count, six Astros are on track to have career years. Two of
them, Moises Alou and Craig Biggio, are bona fide Most Valuable
Player candidates. Prorated over an entire season, Randy Johnson's
Houston numbers are Cy Young-sized. And Larry Dierker is a
garlic-strong contender for Manager of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not exactly a shock that they've already won one fewer
game than they did all last season with 27 still to play. If they
stay their current course _ not an impossibility if they can avoid
lapsing into too many more brain-dead efforts like the one
Wednesday that produced a loopy 6-2 loss to the Braves _ they'll
finish 100-62 with a player payroll only modestly in excess of what
Atlanta spends on its starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are a jerry-rigged team, to be sure. Make that Gerry
with a G.
</P>
<P>
   Credit must be given where credit is due. As glorious a season
as it has been for a slew of guys with stars on their caps,
nobody's having a better year than the guy with stars in his eyes,
general manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker could be National League Executive of the Year on the
strength of the Alou and Johnson deals alone. Throw in the lopsided
trades for Carl Everett (.315) and Sean Bergman (11-7), and he's in
a league of his own. Gerry really should win the title by a
unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   No joke _ Dierker can manage
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, he deserves retroactive points for the
unabashedly brilliant move of putting Dierker in the dugout.
Although club president Tal Smith suggested it and the first words
out of Hunsicker's agape mouth were, ``You must be joking,'' he
warmed to the idea quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Larry for 20 years,'' he said. ``I knew that he
knew baseball, and I thought he would create a comfortable
environment in the clubhouse for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dierker has.
</P>
<P>
   True, Hunsicker didn't re-sign Darryl Kile over the offseason, a
failure he calls ``easily my biggest disappointment.'' But if he
had kept Kile, Johnson wouldn't be here today and chances are
neither would Derek Bell (.304, 92 RBIs). With all due respect to
D.K., I'll take R.J. straight up, hands down. So what if he's most
likely just passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker could be batting 1.000 if free-agent acquisition Dave
Clark weren't batting .200. But Clark has been more effective as a
pinch hitter of late _ 9-for-20 since July 18 _ and Hunsicker,
feeling lucky with good reason, predicts: ``Dave's going to win
some games for us before the season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been breaking for Gerry, which is to say
smashingly well, Clark will probably sock the winning home run in
the bottom of the ninth inning in the seventh game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has a creative mind and keen baseball instincts, and
the Astros' fine-line, ``small-market'' circumstances demand both.
Their margin for error is minuscule. They can't throw money at
their shortcomings. They must outthink the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Change of scenery works
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Everett could have been a public-relations fiasco.
Cripes, his kids had been taken away from him for reasons of abuse,
a red-flag charge. But Hunsicker, who had been around Everett as a
Met and remembered him to be ``always smiling a good teammate,''
gambled that the situation wasn't as bad as was being reported in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. As an Astro, Everett's conduct has been exemplary. So
has his switch hitting, and fielding. The Carl Everett that
Hunsicker remembered couldn't finance, much less buy, a hit batting
righthanded. The Carl Everett he wound up with in Houston is just a
shade under .300 from the right side of the plate and a sound
center fielder to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman had a lousy night against the Braves, getting yanked
from a lost effort in the sixth inning. Remember, however, that he
came to Houston a career 18-27 pitcher who wasn't assured of a
roster spot when spring training began. That Bergman would be
attempting to notch a 12th victory before September says at least
as much about the roll Hunsicker has been on as Alou's 38 home runs
_ 15 more than he had ever hit before _ and the four ahh-inspiring
W's in five starts Johnson has recorded since his acrimonious
parting with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them could be construed as gambles, their respective
superstar credentials notwithstanding. Although Alou brought with
him a deserved reputation for producing in the clutch, he can be
difficult to handle. In a word, moody. And Johnson had been
behaving badly in Seattle, with statistics to match.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker thoroughly researched both, though, and concluded
their through-the-roof-good risk-reward ratios made adding them to
the Astros' roster imperative.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, this team, his team, is the best baseball team Houston
has ever had. Even if it didn't show up Wednesday night.

 &HT;    Movie turns hot Studio 54 into a big bore
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Studio 54 hadn't existed, we would have invented it in our
dreams. Or our movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub was a late-1970s blast of neo-Roman
decadence where everyone could be fabulous ... if only they could
get inside. It was a place of contradictions: the hottest spangled
venue for the disco beat and a swan song for that wave of music;
the greatest place to party and the final incentive to book a suite
at Betty Ford; a hotbed for sexual whatever-you-feel-like and an
early way station for the AIDS virus, which stopped the dancing for
many in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So what sort of movie do you make about a place like that?
Comedy? Tragedy? Satire? Or a tired, creaky fable about a
small-town stud who gets seduced by the limelight, almost loses
himself, but gets saved by the right girl?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the latter is what writer-director Mark
Christopher gives us in ``54.'' Our hero is Shane (Ryan Phillippe),
a sweet but dim New Jersey boy dreaming of a better life on the
Manhattan dance floor. (Hmmm, he must have seen ``Saturday Night
Fever.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a movie relies heavily on voice-overs, you know
something's wrong. ``54'' is wallpapered with Shane's dull updates,
explaining things the movie should be showing instead of telling
us.
</P>
<P>
   Shane gets inside the club and lands a bartending job. He
becomes famous the Andy Warhol way, counting toward 15 one empty
minute at a time. But the movie doesn't get its biggest joke. Shane
lands a photo in Interview magazine and becomes the boy toy for an
older singer, Sela Ward. But he bristles when people treat him like
a piece of meat. And that's all Shane amounts to. The script
doesn't give him any perceivable traits or talents besides a tight
body and a knack for doing splits on a crowded dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``54'' is hypocritical (in other words, very Hollywood). It
wants to offer a cautionary tale while giving you a contact high.
Reportedly, the film was the victim of tampering and reshoots, and
it shows. It is squeamish about showing its main characters
(including Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer as Shane's married club
pals) getting ahead the 54 way _ by schmoozing, hustling, doing
whatever it takes. It even makes Shane's dream girl Julie (Neve
Campbell), an actress willing to do anything to get ahead, do a 180
and become a saint. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who seems in on the multilayered joke of the
club, with its ground-zero encapsulation of everything wonderful
and tragic about the late 1970s and early '80s, is Mike Myers. His
Steve Rubell, the Studio 54 owner, is a muzzy, smiling, perpetually
stoned troll working out his own childhood traumas in the
cocaine-piled playground he created. Squinting myopically at the
glorious debacle of his own life, he's the only reason to see the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``54''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek and Mike Myers. Written and
directed by Mark Christopher. Rated R for sexuality, profanity and
drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.

   The verdict: Kills disco a second time.

 &HT;    `Slums': A biting take on teendom
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' begins on a note of exquisite
embarrassment that epitomizes the entire movie: Squirming while a
saleslady fits her with a new bra, Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha
Lyonne) listens in horror as her father, Murray (Alan Arkin),
casually says, ``Overnight she got stacked, just like her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-divorce, Vivian's mother is no longer in the picture. The
sole female in a family that includes brothers Ben (David
Krumholtz) and Rickey (Eli Marienthal), Vivian is the odd girl out
in a clan of Peter Pans who like nothing better than elbowing up to
a steak breakfast at the Sizzler.
</P>
<P>
   It's the summer of 1976. Every three months or so, Dad rouses
them in the middle of the night, skipping out on rent and moving
them into a new fleabag on the edge of town. It's the only way
Murray can afford to stay inside the ZIP code; he wants his
children to have a Beverly Hills education.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think the kids' grown cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) would be
a good influence on Vivian. But Rita is on the lam from a rehab
clinic; while she makes a fun big-sister figure for Vivian, she's
not exactly an icon of responsibility. Meanwhile, Vivian is being
romanced by the guy across the hall, a pot-selling fellow named
Eliot (Kevin Corrigan) who always wears a Charles Manson T-shirt.
And Murray is courting an upper-middle-class widow (Jessica
Walter), who's looking for companionship instead of another
husband.
</P>
<P>
   What happens isn't as important as how it happens in
writer-director Tamara Jenkins' irresistible feature debut. She
re-creates the daily humiliations of adolescence with
wince-inducing accuracy. What's unusual is to see this territory
covered from a distinctly female perspective, with a sexual
freshness that's bracing (and sometimes blunt). Vivian obsesses
over her breasts, transforming them into the symbol for all the
chaos in her life. Lyonne brings to her sexual fumblings with Eliot
the aura of a detached young scholar trying to understand a very
perplexing subject.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' dead-accurate eye for '70s detail includes halter tops,
the horrific, gilt-edged apartment the Abramowitzes move into, and
Ben's ceiling-high bong. Almost every scene has a lovely,
off-kilter detail, whether it's the sight of Ben singing ``Luck Be
a Lady Tonight'' (he's angling to play Sky Masterson in the school
production of ``Guys and Dolls'') or anecdotes about Lucille Ball's
stingy Halloween habits.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is on the director's fresh, unpredictable wavelength,
pulling off scenes that switch on a dime from hilarious to
heartbreaking. Lyonne is terrific, navigating the waters of teen
angst, trying to decide whether she should love or loathe her
family. Tomei is her usual lively self, as is indie regular
Corrigan. And Arkin is wonderful as the most complex of the
characters. His Murray is someone with whom we have to come to
terms, just as Vivian does; he's sometimes charming, sometimes
scary, and when we least expect it, deeply vulnerable. In other
words, human.
</P>
<P>
   A meditation on love, forgiveness and the double-edged facts of
family life, ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is ultimately slight. It's
a series of moments and small, piercing insights. But it's so
beautifully realized that it renews your faith in film as a medium
that can show you new worlds. Or old worlds that you forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne, Alan Arkin and Marisa Tomei. Written
and directed by Tamara Jenkins. Rated R for nudity, profanity and
sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A vivid, original, very funny look at coming of age
on the fringes.

 &HT;    A light-fingered tale of false love
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Thief'' was robbed at last spring's Academy Awards. While
``Character,'' the winner as best foreign-language film, has
considerable merit, this Russian entry is a far more evocative and
affecting work.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Character,'' ``The Thief''' is a tale of fathers and
sons. In this case, it's about fathers symbolic or surrogate,
idealized or unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, set in 1952 when Josef Stalin was inflicting his
brand of paternalism on the Soviet Union, is told from the point of
view of 6-year-old Sanya (Misha Philipchuk). He and his mother,
Katya (Ekaterina Rednikova), a creamily pretty young widow, are
traveling by train when a studly soldier, Tolyan (Vladimir
Mashkov), crosses their path. He easily seduces Katya, and the next
thing Sanya knows, he's got a new daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the legal sense, but the three form a nice little family
unit _ a convenient front, it turns out, for Tolyan's true
occupation. He's a thief whose modus operandi is to charm his
victims, then rob them. It's pretty much the approach he uses on
Katya and Sanya. But what he takes from them can't be bought or
sold: her heart and her son's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Still, little Sanya is so eager for a father _ he's haunted by
visions of his real dad, who died before he was born _ that he
eventually falls for the macho yet protective false father provided
by Tolyan.
</P>
<P>
   As allegories go, this one is pretty transparent. Tolyan even
has a tattoo of ``Papa'' Stalin on his chest. The film's strength,
however, lies not in its symbolism but in its telling visual
details, its almost poetic vignettes and the three wonderful
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Misha Philipchuk is one of those effortlessly natural and
appealing child actors whose every emotion registers. Rednikova's
role is less complex, but she has the face of a Russian icon and a
subtle way of tracing Katya's descent from innocence to alcoholic
bitterness. Mashkov, who is a major star in his homeland, suggests
a Soviet Stanley Kowalski with his confounding yet irresistible
mixture of sensuality and brutishness.
</P>
<P>
   One further father-son note: Director Pavel Chukhrai is the son
of Grigori Chukhrai, whose World War II drama ``Ballad of a
Soldier'' (1959) was the first Soviet movie accepted at an American
film festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thief''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vladimir Mashkov. Directed by Pavel Chukhrai. Rated R
for sex, nudity and language. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A Russian fable of father and son that'll steal
into your heart.

 &HT;    `Next Stop' serves wry, with a side of reality
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' the title of the charming new
romantic comedy ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' has both a
transportational and a symbolic meaning. There really is a Boston
subway stop named Wonderland (it's a dog track). But Wonderland,
where everything gets curiouser and curiouser, is also an apt
description for the world this movie's heroine inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse who's dumped by her jerk of a boyfriend in the first
scene, Erin (Hope Davis from ``The Daytrippers'') is further
burdened by her jerk of a mother. Without Erin's knowledge or
approval, Mom places a personal ad on her behalf in a Boston paper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an absolutely attractive and inexplicably unattached
guy named Alan (Alan Gelfant) keeps crossing Erin's path without
the two ever quite connecting. It's a spin on the old
boy-meets-girl plot: Boy just misses girl. (Last year's ``Till
There Was You'' tried the same thing with less success.)
</P>
<P>
   Director Brad Anderson, who co-wrote the script with Lyn Vaus,
is stronger on character nuance than he is on narrative. In fact,
he needlessly overloads his picture with subplots. In one, Alan, an
aspiring marine biologist, is caught up in a struggle between a
corrupt developer (Robert Klein), to whom he owes money, and the
local aquarium, where he volunteers. In another, Erin becomes the
target of a milder version of an ``In the Company of Men'' bet,
thanks to her mother's ad.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of unsuitable suitors is familiar but still amusing.
More to the point is the way Erin suffers these various fools _ not
gladly like a fluffy, romantic-comedy heroine, but wryly and
warily, like a real human being.
</P>
<P>
   She even reads books. I can't remember the last time a female
who wasn't meant to be a dog, a nag or some other kind of too-smart
loser read a book in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the key to this film's appeal. It applies a
naturalistic, stripped-down, independent-film sensibility to a
vintage glossy Hollywood predicament. Erin and Alan are honest and
adult, in both their solitude and their need for connection.
They're also clever, lively and good company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' exists in its own little zone, a place
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop, Wonderland''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant. Directed by Brad Anderson.
Rated R for vulgar language and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 36 minutes.

 &HT;    `Fate and destiny' played a role in making of the movie, actor
says
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When actor Alan Gelfant's independent film ``The Destiny of
Marty Fine'' took second prize at last year's Slamdance Film
Festival, the first-prize winner was a movie called ``The
Daytrippers,'' starring Hope Davis. At the better-known Sundance
Film Festival, taking place the same time in Park City, Utah, a
first-time director named Brad Anderson was screening his feature
``The Darien Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it good timing: The actors and director got to know each
other's work that January and came together for Anderson's second
film, ``Next Stop, Wonderland,'' which opens in metro theaters
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of synchronicity and fate and destiny with
the whole making of this movie,'' says Gelfant. Which is fitting,
because ``Wonderland'' flirts with that notion of unseen forces
moving our lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Davis plays a nurse going through a series of
terrible dates looking for Mr. Right. That happens to be Gelfant's
character, a Boston plumber studying to be a marine biologist. But
in the movie, the two just keep missing each other.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gelfant spent most of his time on the set not
acting with Davis. ``We had a cordial but distant interaction,'' he
says. ``I would have been happy to spend more time with her, which
we eventually did. But as an actress, she wanted to keep her
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most romantic comedies, ``Wonderland'' balances its humor
with a fluid, intelligent sense of melancholy, underscored by its
bossa nova soundtrack. Gelfant liked the tone of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title `romantic comedy' suggests something that's insipid
and unbelievable,'' he says. ``You know, you meet a woman, and the
next day you're flying together to Europe. If that really happened
in real life, my friends would say, `That's insane. Do you think
you're in a romantic comedy?' But I liked the melancholy and
realism in this script.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of synchronicity, he had a few things in common
with his character. Not only was Gelfant's father a marine
biologist, but Gelfant went to school in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that he worked with director Vincent Murphy, who
happens to be on the faculty at Emory University these days. ``Are
you serious?'' Gelfant asks when he learns this. ``Vinnie Murphy
was my senior acting teacher. Him and a guy called Tim McDonough.
They inspired me more than anything.'' Time out for more goose
bumps when Gelfant learns that McDonough is also an Atlanta
resident now.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's something to this fate thing.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles resident for eight years, Gelfant, 41, is still
carving out the life of an almost-known actor; on top of acting
gigs, he manages the apartment building he lives in. After ``Marty
Fine'' was honored at Slamdance, he received recognition from an
unexpected quarter. ``When I got back home, most of the cards I'd
gotten were from entertainment lawyers and tax lawyers,'' he says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect ``Wonderland'' to make him a star. But he's
hoping it gets enough recognition (and makes enough money) that his
name could help other good independent films down the road get
made.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and just so you know. Yes, he settled on an entertainment
lawyer. ``He hasn't really had to do anything for me yet,'' Gelfant
says. ``But he's a nice guy.''

   RUSSIA IN CRISIS: GORBACHEV SPEAKS
</P>
<P>
   ----------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's economic and governmental crisis deepens, Mikhail
Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union and Nobel Peace Prize
winner, has offered clear and often clairvoyant perspective in his
most recent column from The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev wrote of President Boris Yeltsin: ``If the president
and his ever-changing entourage continue to insist on a flawed and
unworkable economic program, it could ignite mass protest.
Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a social upheaval
could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is quite ominous and
the events could go out of control. This is an unacceptable
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Given the turmoil in Russia, and the shifting alignments of
Russian politics, Gorbachev's opinions become all the more
influential. &LR;
</P>

 Color slides and black and white photos of Matt Damon with Gretchen
Mol in a scene from ``Rounders'' and with Robin Williams in a scene
from ``Good Will Hunting.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not long ago Matt Damon was down and out in Hollywood.
 &HT;    The boyish actor was counting pennies, living on beans and
wondering if he'd ever get work for bit parts in TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    What a difference a couple of years make.
 &HT;    Today at 28 Damon is the hottest actor in Hollywood. He's been
on the cover of just about every major magazine since he and his
writing partner Ben Affleck sold their ``Good Will Hunting'' script
to Hollywood for half a million dollars and as a bonus took home
the Oscar for screenwriting. Now Damon finds himself working
virtually around the clock.
 &HT;    Currently he's appearing in the title role in Steven Spielberg's
blockbuster ``Saving Private Ryan.'' On Sept. 11 he shows up in a
leading role in ``Rounders,'' a film about professional poker
players, costarring Edward Norton, Martin Laundau, John Turturo and
John Malkovich. Damon plays a cardsharp who uses his winnings to
put himself through law school.
 &HT;    He's about to spend five months in Italy shooting ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' opposite Jude Law, with ``English Patient'' director
Anthony Minghella. Billy Bob Thornton will direct him in ``All The
Pretty Horses'' early next year.
 &HT;    Damon was hired for ``Saving Private Ryan'' while on the set of
``Good Will Hunting,'' when Robin Williams introduced him to
Spielberg. Damon compared working on ``Ryan'' to ``having a
scholarship into the best film school in the world.''
 &HT;    On the personal front he ended his high-profile romance with his
``Good Will'' costar Minnie Driver shortly after going on TV to
announce his love for her. Since the Oscars he has been dating
Winona Ryder so persistently that USA Today ran a story that said,
``Winona and Matt are not engaged.''
 &HT;    Sitting in a swank hotel in Marina Del Rey, Calif., he smiles at
the story: ``Well, I don't want to talk about it. There was a time
when I was very open about my personal life but I've made mistakes
before. This engagement stuff is kind of silly.''
 &HT;    Apart from the occasional wince, however, he handles his
newfound status with aplomb and tries to keep a sense of
proportion.
 &HT;    ``It's gotten a little crazy,'' he sighs. ``But I think it's all
due to the power of the media. Look, in the mid-'80s there were
stories that said Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen were the
biggest stars in the world. Michael couldn't leave the house
without 25 bodyguards and Springsteen you could bump into in a
local bar. I think it's all what you make of it. I'm not gonna do
the whole bodyguard nonsense _ or anything like that. I'm trying to
keep things in perspective.''
 &HT;    Family and friends in hometown Boston help keep his feet on the
ground. ``I'm really lucky that it didn't happen until now,'' he
says. ``I have a whole bunch of people I grew up with who aren't
that impressed but are happy for us.''
 &HT;    One of them is Ben Affleck, his longtime writing and acting pal
who is now dating Gwyneth Paltrow. ``I haven't seen him in a while,
'' says Damon, ``but I like to kid him about Gwyneth _ I'd
telephone and say, 'Hey, your girlfriend is doing real good. How
are those love scenes going?'''
 &HT;    He says Affleck plans to join him in Italy to finish a script.
``It might be a story about a halfway house in Boston,'' says
Damon. ``We've done 150 pages ... but only five of them were
usable. We're dying to get to work. ``Good Will Hunting'' is a hard
act to follow.'
 &HT;    Also they both have concerns about overusing their friendship
and the cute story of their collaboration. ``We're getting to the
point,'' Damon explains, ``where we don't want to feel we pimped
out our friendship _ especially with the flood of stories about how
we grew up together. And sometimes you can't help feeling that
you're whoring out your personal life for professional gain.''
 &HT;    If he seems overly cautious about, ``the success thing'', it's
because he sees the danger signs everywhere he goes. ``People laugh
at your jokes too hard now and you know the joke wasn't that funny.
But then maybe after a while you think it is. ''
 &HT;    Still he wants to make it clear he's not one of those stars who
no sooner get a whiff of success than they start whining about a
loss of privacy. ``I went from needing money and really needing a
job to being able to sit back and pick select jobs really
carefully. It's an incredible feeling. Things have turned into an
embarrassment of riches _ it's every dream I've ever dared dream
come true.
 &HT;    ``And it's tough to have a bad day when you're in the dairy
section of the supermarket and people keep coming up and saying,
'Good job.''''

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For a generation, United Methodists, Presbyterians and
Episcopalians have been debating whether to approve same-sex
marriages and the ordaining of homosexuals. The pattern was the
same in each church. Gay activists gained the support of national
church staff and of many female clergy who put forth resolutions at
every national convention. But they lost nearly every vote.
 &HT;    As the battle wore on, it turned off so many church members that
all three denominations have seen their membership shrink by about
a third since 1965.
 &HT;    However, in recent months leaders all three old-line Protestant
denominations have gotten fed up and said ``No'' to the pressures
of gay activists.
 &HT;    On August 11, the Judicial Council of the United Methodist
Church, which serves as the denomination's ``Supreme Court,'' ruled
unanimously that the following language placed in the 1996 Book of
Discipline had the force of law, and violators can be punished:
``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not be
conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our
churches.''
 &HT;    The Rev. John Ed Mathison, pastor of the 6,000-member Frazier
United Methodist Church in Montgomery, Ala., is delighted: ``The
Judicial Council makes it concrete and clear what the church stand
is. Any pastor performing a same-sex marriage will be brought to
trial and lose his credentials.''
 &HT;    What prompted the council ruling was the case of Rev. Jimmy
Creech, pastor of First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Neb., who
performed a covenanting service for two lesbians in 1997. He was
suspended by Nebraska Bishop Joel Martinez and charged with a
violation.
 &HT;    At a trial he argued that Book of Discipline language was only
``advisory,'' and he was acquitted by one vote. That moved
Southwest UM bishops to ask the Judicial Council for a definitive
ruling, and it came this month. (Creech was reinstated for a few
months, but was not reappointed in June.)
 &HT;    The strategy of conservatives within the Presbyterian Church,
U.S.A. was similar. In their 1996 General Assembly they voted to
place language into the Constitution calling for all church
officers to practice ``fidelity within the covenant of marriage and
chastity in singleness.''
 &HT;    The language was crafted so that it was as critical of adultery
or cohabitation by clergy, elders and deacons as it was of
homosexual conduct.
 &HT;    ``We don't have an organized group of Presbyterian adulterers,
but we do have organized Presbyterian homosexuals'' who fought the
measure, said Parker Williamson, editor of the influential
newspaper, ``The Presbyterian Layman.''
 &HT;    After losing the General Assembly fight, gay activists took the
battle to the church's 172 presbyteries who had to vote for the
measure before it was ratified. Nearly half of the presbyteries (43
percent) voted with the gays, but constitutional change was adopted
as 57 percent of the presbyteries endorsed it.
 &HT;    Gays persuaded the 1997 General Assembly to soften the language
to simply call for ``fidelity and integrity in all relationships.''
This spring, an even wider 66 percent of presbyteries rejected the
watering down, leaving the tougher language intact.
 &HT;    Interestingly, Williamson reports the presbyteries that voted
for the tougher language had membership growth from 1990-1996,
while those voting with gays came from churches that lost 11
percent of their membership.
 &HT;    Most recently, Anglican Bishops meeting at the Lambeth
Conference voted by a stunningly wide margin, 526-70, against ``the
legitimizing or blessing of same sex unions'' and ``the ordination
of those involved in such unions.''
 &HT;    Bishops from the fast-growing churches of Africa overwhelmed the
liberals, all of whom were from North America, Europe and
Australia, all of which are suffering from shrinking church
attendance. In fact, there are more Anglicans worshiping on Sunday
in Nigeria alone than in all the West. No wonder Africans embrace
Biblical orthodoxy.
 &HT;    The impact of Lambeth vote's on the Episcopal Church in the U.S.
is unclear, since it is merely advisory. Newark Bishop John Spong
grumbled, ``If the Anglican Church becomes dedicated to preserving
prejudices, our followers may well vote with their feet.''
 &HT;    Is the man blind? Under his pro-gay leadership, 28 percent of
his church members walked away in a decade.
 &HT;    ``This vote clearly shows that the present leadership of the
American church is out of step with the wider Anglican communion,''
said Peter Moore, president of the conservative Trinity Episcopal
School for Ministry. ``It puts the liberal American church leaders
in a quandary. Do they listen to the rest of the communion, and
rejoin the church catholic, or do they begin to act like a cult
with their own sources of authority and doctrines?''
 &HT;    If the Episcopal Church wants to grow again, it too will return
to Scriptural standards.

`ANDRO' USAGE A BAD MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not about asterisks or an unfair advantage. It's not about
one man's quest, the products in his locker and their link to the
steroid tree.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's all about the message. About kids who marvel at
Mark McGwire bulging out of his uniform, blasting baseballs into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who are now flocking to stores, pumping their bodies full
of Androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the advocates of the latest
performance-enhancing craze better be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, it is not an anabolic steroid,'' said Dr. Scott
Connelly, a leading pioneer in the development of Androstenedione
and its bulging family. ``But no one can sit here and tell you they
have data in their possession that these compounds, over the long
term, won't have significant negative side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the problem. No one knows for sure whether
Androstenedione is harmless in moderation or destined to produce
the next Lyle Alzado. For every doctor who calls it a well-dressed
steroid, another expert claims it's much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the product is flying off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   A gym in Phoenix posted an advertisement on its locker room
wall. A fitness store in Scottsdale carries 100 different varieties
of the stuff. At a well-known nutritional chain in Tempe, more than
100 people have walked through the doors in the past week searching
for Andro.
</P>
<P>
   ``A constant request,'' said Michele Hernandez, a GNC franchise
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its popularity is extraordinary, especially since the McGwire
thing,'' said Mark Bozza, owner of the House of Fitness in
Scottsdale. ``And I have to be honest. I do get a lot of young kids
in here, although I get a lot more college students.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate focusing on McGwire and his use of Andro rages out
of control, there are some distinctions to make.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anyone to blame for the mess, it's Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, the NCAA and the IOC have banned Androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has no clear-cut drug policy in place, largely because
it hasn't had a commissioner for the past six years. It knows all
about the perils of chewing tobacco, but largely is clueless to
everything else and completely impotent when it comes to
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lack of knowledge, you can pinpoint a 1994
Congressional act that removed supplements like Andro from the
strict control of the FDA, which requires years of research and
testing before a product hits the market.
</P>
<P>
   So McGwire is absolved. It's not illegal. While it may increase
his strength and aid his recovery, it won't be responsible if
McGwire shatters Roger Maris' home run record.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was a rookie _ and 60 pounds lighter _ he bashed 49
homers. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Maris was a chain smoker,'' Connelly said. ``He'd smoke
himself into a coma after every game. Who's to say his ability
wasn't enhanced by having a nicotine level that was 10 times
higher? If you want to get ludicrous, let's get crazy with
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just because it's legal doesn't make it safe. And it
doesn't make it right.
</P>
<P>
   So baseball needs to wake up and implement a sophisticated drug
policy. It needs to identify the drugs and performance-enhancing
supplements it won't tolerate. Instead, there is an abundance of
Creatine commercials during the Little League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire needs to send a message, too. He should make it clear
that there are uncertainties surrounding his supplement of choice.
He should insist that any copycats do so under proper supervision,
and that anyone who emulates his diet could be in for a nasty
surprise down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it have abuse potential?'' Connelly said. ``Of course it
has abuse potential. Aspirin has abuse potential.''
</P>
<P>
   But aspirin doesn't build muscle. It doesn't make you look like
Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly says there is evidence that Androstenedione, under
normal dosages, carries no toxicity in the short term. Unlike
steroids, it is not pure testosterone bombarding the system.
Rather, it simply allows your body to produce testosterone, though
his opponents claim there is little difference.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is quick to say that young males, particularly high
school kids, should avoid Andro. That interfering with their own
hormonal tidal waves is a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess who's buying the stuff?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has cried over abused children. He donates huge amounts
of money every year because of abused children. That alone should
shake his sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, he will leave an indelible mark on the game
before the season is history. In 20 years, let's hope the legacy
doesn't have a dark side. &QL;

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL'S BACKERS SEEK 8 MORE GOP SENATORS
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. With POLMONEY-DATA for release Saturday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate returns Monday from its summer vacation
with most Republican members holding firm against a bipartisan
campaign finance bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., insist that the five legislative weeks left before the
Congress's scheduled adjournment on Oct. 9 might give them enough
time to overcome that.
</P>
<P>
   To help them, a coalition of national groups favoring tighter
restrictions on the unregulated, unlimited ``soft money'' at the
heart of the campaign scandals of 1996 is trying to convince at
least eight GOP senators to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two or three move by mid-September, others will move to the
reform side,'' predicted Steve Weissman of Public Citizen, one of
the pro-reform groups.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Aug. 6 voted by a convincing margin of 252-179 for
a bipartisan bill similar to legislation cosponsored by McCain and
Feingold that was blocked in the Senate last October and again this
March. Both versions would ban ``soft money'' _ contributions to
parties by people giving more than $25,000 a year or by
corporations or unions giving any amount _ and would regulate
pre-election ``issue ads'' that mention candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version had the support of seven Republicans and all
45 Democrats. But 48 Republicans voted in March to filibuster the
bill. Because a filibuster by 40 senators can block further action
on any bill, the House-passed bill can't get through the Senate
unless at least eight Republicans change their stand.
</P>
<P>
   None announced a change of heart during August. Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., predicted he and Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., could keep GOP defections below eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're more likely to see Elvis again than to see this bill
pass the Senate,'' said McConnell, under whose chairmanship the
National Republican Senate Committee has raised nearly five times
as much soft money as it did under Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's really saying is, 'Oh my God, here it comes
again!''' Feingold said Wednesday. ``It's down to a small group of
filibustering senators trying to resist the will of the majority of
the entire Congress, and they will lose his battle ultimately _
either in September or early next year.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, McCain said he and Feingold would need at
least a week to feel out other senators and agree on a floor
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my intention to raise the issue, but I have to wait and
see what the parliamentary situation is,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some added momentum, because the House passed a
bipartisan bill with 61 Republicans _ that's more than one-fourth
of the Republican House members,'' said political scientist Michael
Malbin of the State University of New York at Albany. ``But the
people who oppose it benefit from the timing, because it would take
several legislative steps in the Senate, the House and a conference
committee to make it law.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most people, regardless of party, favor passage of
campaign finance reforms, though few think they will pass.
</P>
<P>
   But any Republican senators who do vote for reforms will be
defying their party establishment, as was made clear in 30-second
ads telecast last week by Republican National Chairman Jim
Nicholson, who called for another investigation of fund-raising
abuses by Democrats in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot of talk about campaign reform. The truth is new
laws won't mean a thing to people who broke the old laws,'' said
Nicholson, whose party has raised $70 million in soft money,
compared to $46 million by the Democrats, since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill has the support of Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who said, ``All 45 Senate
Democrats continue to stand behind this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, the seven Republicans can also be counted on,''
said Don Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause. Recently,
his group, Public Citizen and the League of Women Voters expanded
their pro-reform coalition to include new grassroots allies with
broader concerns _ the American Association of Retired Persons, the
Environmental Defense Fund and some national Protestant and Jewish
social-action groups.
</P>
<P>
   State chapters of those national groups have started staging
news events targeted at 15 of the 48 GOP holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators in tough re-election fights in places like Colorado
and New York and Missouri have to feel uncomfortable at the
prospect of voting against a bipartisan campaign finance reform
package,'' Feingold said. Republican Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell
of Colorado, Al D'Amato of New York and Christopher (Kit) Bond of
Missouri are seeking re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 other Republicans targeted by the expanded coalition have
indicated support in the past for at least some reforms. They are
Sens. Tim Hutchinson, Ark.; William Roth, Del.; Dan Coats and Dick
Lugar, Ind.; Charles Grassley, Iowa; Sam Brownback, Kan.; Spencer
Abraham, Mich.; Chuck Hagel, Neb.; Judd Gregg, N.H., Mike DeWine,
Ohio; Robert Smith, Ore., and Bill Frist, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell scoffs at the idea that election-year pressure
would work. In his Senate office, he often shows visitors his
framed copy of a newspaper front page reporting on a successful
GOP-led filibuster he led against a campaign finance reform bill.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is dated Oct. 1, 1994. As he delights in pointing out,
elections held five weeks later gave Republicans control of both
the Senate and the House for the first time in four decades.

PIRATES' FORMULA SPELLS SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest club in baseball was in town the last two nights.
The Pittsburgh Pirates may be a few years away from competing on a
serious basis, but this is a club that has caught the eye of many
executives in the baseball community.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have budding stars at several positions. Headlining
their list is third baseman Aramis Ramirez, catcher Jason Kendall,
right fielder Jose Guillen, center fielder Adrian Brown, second
baseman Tony Womack and possibly the best of all in first baseman
Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some ballclub over there,'' Arizona Manager Buck
Showalter raved before the start of the series. ``They could have
quite a future on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, a small-market club with limited financial
abilities, decided several years ago to use the June draft a bit
differently than other clubs. Pittsburgh knew it couldn't pay out
the huge bonuses many other top picks were receiving. So the
Pirates decided to choose the best available athletes, even if it
meant picking players with limited baseball talent, and mold them
into players. It's a formula other clubs have started emulating in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all starts with pitching and the Pirates aren't
short in this department, either. Jason Christensen, Jason Schmidt,
Jose Silva, Rich Loiselle and Ricardo Rincon headline a staff that
is awaiting the arrival of Kris Benson, the overall first pick in
the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Problems did arise earlier this season when several of the
Pirates' hot-shot prospects began acting as though they were
established major leaguers, forgetting what it takes to take the
next step and compete with the big boys in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game does a good enough job of humbling you,'' Young
said. ``You don't need to go out and try to humble anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem facing these Pirates is what it will
take to keep this collection of potential All-Stars together. If
these players reach their potential, they will surely command the
kind of salaries the current state of the Pirates simply cannot
afford. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh Henry waits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Sammy Sosa enjoying his finest season ever, the Chicago
Cubs may want to try to protect Sosa in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Henry Rodriguez, who has 31 home runs and 84 RBI,
will be a free agent after the season. Rodriguez has teamed with
Sosa to smack 83 home runs. Rodriguez would love to remain on
Chicago's north side, but said he will not seek an extension while
the Cubs remain in the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might distract from the wild card,'' Rodriguez said. ``I
don't want it to get in the way. But I'd love to come back, knowing
Sammy Sosa is here and having gotten to know all the guys. I'll
look at the Cubs first before anyone else. Maybe they'll come to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs should not discount the importance Rodriguez's presence
has played on Sosa's success in 1999. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dude, you're kidding &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta Braves were in Los Angeles last week, a film
crew from FOX wanted to take Braves outfielder Ryan Klesko to the
LA beaches he roamed as a teenager. The crew wanted to film Klesko
surfing on the same waves he hung 10 on as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   The crew, and Klesko, was disappointed to learn that Klesko is
forbidden to partake in such endeavors as part of his current
long-term contract. Nevertheless, Klesko went along to Huntington
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my surfboard,'' Klesko said. ``It was awfully
tempting. So I sat on the beach and moped. I watched a surf
contest, ate a bagel and read the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, another of Klesko's hobbies that was taken away by the
contract: He's no longer allowed to accompany police on drug
raids. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Very welcome news &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tentative 1999 schedule has very few two-game series, which
players hate. The National League schedule alone, which includes
more than 100 two-game series this year, will likely have a few
more than a dozen next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major concern for players that it was too much travel
and the competition level was being hindered,'' said San Francisco
Giants player representative Jeff Kent. ``Players and owners have
addressed that, and we're trying to get it right.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
An explanation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis' game against Pittsburgh was called because of
rain in the seventh inning last week, it brought out several
questions pertaining to why games that are called are played over
in their entirety while suspended games are picked up where they
left off.
</P>
<P>
   The division in terminology began in the 1930s and '40s, before
lights were installed in the majority of ballparks. As most anyone
knows, a game is official once the losing club bats at least five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   A game is declared a tie, such as last week's Cardinals-Pirates
game, if the score is tied after five full innings and the visiting
club did not score in the previous half inning. The rule was
instituted to prevent a club from stalling.
</P>
<P>
   It was not uncommon to see the visiting club, which had just
taken a lead, start substituting pitchers between batters if rain
had started falling in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   A game is considered suspended if the visiting club tied or took
the lead in the top of an inning without the home club having
finished its at-bat in the bottom of the inning. Such games are
resumed where they left off. For those interested, check rules 4:10
and 4:12 in the official baseball rule book. &QL;

 &HT;    
 By GRIGORY YAVLINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years ago, the so-called reformers running Russia concluded
that three things were essential for economic growth: a stable
exchange rate, low inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    The challenge was to achieve each as quickly as possible, after
which the economic transformation would be largely secured.
 &HT;    But it was a trap. Financial stabilization was achieved, but not
economic growth. And with the re-election of the president, in a
notoriously unfair process, a kind of political stabilization was
achieved, but not political reform. Aid was given by the West, but
not in a determined manner that would encourage change.
 &HT;    The result is more costly by the day. Economic stagnation is one
reason. Russia's gross domestic product is half the level it was 10
years ago under communism. Another is that the so-called ``shock
reforms'' _ particularly the ill-fated voucher privatization _ only
drove the economy to barter. Up to 75 percent of the entire
economic turnover runs on barter, promissory notes and other money
surrogates.
 &HT;    In such a duty-free economy, the main problem is not the failure
to collect taxes, but the absence of an economy from which taxes
could be drawn. The government has covered its deficits with
foreign and domestic loans at exceedingly high interest rates.
 &HT;    Now the government cannot pay its bills, its staggering debts or
even its interest payments. It is being forced back to devaluation,
inflation and the same financial instability as before. The only
option offered is more debt _ $22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Japan, to add to the $5.5 billion
already borrowed.
 &HT;    This time, there is likely to be more political instability. For
six years, people have been patient. They have lived without jobs
and without money, waiting for the results of the reforms because
they understood that they were necessary. They are broke, and if
prices begin to skyrocket, they could take to the streets.
 &HT;    It is already starting. People are calling for Yeltsin's
resignation _ not only coal miners and communists, but politicians,
businessmen and other elites, as well as students and people
throughout the regions. It is like a wave; left unchecked, it has
revolutionary potential.
 &HT;    This is Russia, and thus the question of what should be done is
almost a philosophical one. With no reliable mechanism available to
remove the president, it is likely and probably best (in
constitutional terms at least) that he serve out his term, through
the presidential elections in 2000. No one knows whether the newly
appointed administration can address the depth of the economic and
political crises, sustain the confidence of the people and of
investors, and carry support from the State Duma.
 &HT;    This would require a fundamental shift of politics in Moscow and
may seem utopian. But at least now even the robber barons
understand that serious mistakes have been made. Even they can see
that the ruble crisis is a symptom of the broader crisis of
confidence throughout the country.
 &HT;    Only Russia can save itself, but the West can help. To be
effective, however, it must be serious. Economic assistance must be
linked to deep structural as well as political reform.
 &HT;    Western policy must move beyond its reliance on the single
personality of the president to build relationships with a far
broader range of politicians, parties and institutions.
 &HT;    Russia has to transform almost everything, and the necessary
reforms cover the whole gamut: stopping corruption, developing
civil society at grass-roots levels, increasing decentralization,
reducing bureaucracy, building real political parties, securing a
truly independent press, reforming the judiciary and instigating a
raft of measures in the economic sphere.
 &HT;    Shock therapy cannot be applied. Reforms must occur at a speed
that supports, rather than damages, democratic development. Like
the pedals of a bicycle, institutional and political reform must
turn together.
 &HT;    But unless a definitive course is set to achieve these changes,
an open economy will never be effective, and stabilization will
never be achieved. Merely giving cash now while Russia burns is a
waste.

 By GRIGORY YAVLINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years ago, the so-called reformers running Russia concluded
that three things were essential for economic growth: a stable
exchange rate, low inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    The challenge was to achieve each as quickly as possible, after
which the economic transformation would be largely secured.
 &HT;    But it was a trap. Financial stabilization was achieved, but not
economic growth. And with the re-election of the president, in a
notoriously unfair process, a kind of political stabilization was
achieved,but not political reform. Aid was given by the West, but
not in a determined manner that would encourage change.
 &HT;    The result is more costly by the day. Economic stagnation is one
reason. Russia's gross domestic product is half the level it was 10
years ago under communism. Another is that the so-called ``shock
reforms'' _ particularly the ill-fated voucher privatization _ only
drove the economy to barter. Up to 75 percent of the entire
economic turnover runs on barter, promissory notes and other money
surrogates.
 &HT;    In such a duty-free economy, the main problem is not the failure
to collect taxes, but the absence of an economy from which taxes
could be drawn. The government has covered its deficits with
foreign and domestic loans at exceedingly high interest rates.
 &HT;    Now the government cannot pay its bills, its staggering debts or
even its interest payments. It is being forced back to devaluation,
inflation and the same financial instability as before. The only
option offered is more debt _ $22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Japan, to add to the $5.5 billion
already borrowed.
 &HT;    This time, there is likely to be more political instability. For
six years, people have been patient. They have lived without jobs
and without money, waiting for the results of the reforms because
they understood that they were necessary. They are broke, and if
prices begin to skyrocket, they could take to the streets.
 &HT;    It is already starting. People are calling for Yeltsin's
resignation _ not only coal miners and communists, but politicians,
businessmen and other elites, as well as students and people
throughout the regions. It is like a wave; left unchecked, it has
revolutionary potential.
 &HT;    This is Russia, and thus the question of what should be done is
almost a philosophical one. With no reliable mechanism available to
remove the president, it is likely and probably best (in
constitutional terms at least) that he serve out his term, through
the presidential elections in 2000. No one knows whether the newly
appointed administration can address the depth of the economic and
political crises, sustain the confidence of the people and of
investors, and carry support from the State Duma.
 &HT;    This would require a fundamental shift of politics in Moscow and
may seem utopian. But at least now even the robber barons
understand that serious mistakes have been made. Even they can see
that the ruble crisis is a symptom of the broader crisis of
confidence throughout the country.
 &HT;    Only Russia can save itself, but the West can help. To be
effective, however, it must be serious. Economic assistance must be
linked to deep structural as well as political reform.
 &HT;    Western policy must move beyond its reliance on the single
personality of the president to build relationships with a far
broader range of politicians, parties and institutions.
 &HT;    Russia has to transform almost everything, and the necessary
reforms cover the whole gamut: stopping corruption, developing
civil society at grass-roots levels, increasing decentralization,
reducing bureaucracy, building real political parties, securing a
truly independent press, reforming the judiciary and instigating a
raft of measures in the economic sphere.
 &HT;    Shock therapy cannot be applied. Reforms must occur at a speed
that supports, rather than damages, democratic development. Like
the pedals of a bicycle, institutional and political reform must
turn together.
 &HT;    But unless a definitive course is set to achieve these changes,
an open economy will never be effective, and stabilization will
never be achieved. Merely giving cash now while Russia burns is a
waste.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When President Clinton meets with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, each may take comfort from the other's domestic political
difficulties. It is important, however, that any focus on their
respective troubles also includes a careful examination of pressing
international security challenges.
 &HT;    At the top of this agenda should be a discussion of how to
reinvigorate U.S.-Russian cooperation to combat the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
 &HT;    Although the United States and the Soviet Union often cooperated
closely on nonproliferation policy during the Cold War, by now
their partnership has begun to deteriorate. Here are some of the
symptoms of this unraveling:
 &HT;    _ The current stalemate in strategic-arms control negotiations;
 &HT;    _ Major disputes over Russian nuclear and missile exports to
Iran and India;
 &HT;    _ Disagreement about the activities of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq;
 &HT;    _ Lack of meaningful intelligence-sharing concerning illicit
trafficking in nuclear arms and material;
 &HT;    _ The absence of cooperation on important regional security
issues in South Asia, the Middle East and North Korea;
 &HT;    _ Increasing domestic pressures in both Russia and the United
States to give priority to short-term economic and political
considerations rather than long-term international security and
weapons-control objectives.
 &HT;    These strains are increasing at a time when the global
nonproliferation regime is facing urgent challenges that demand
coordinated leadership from the world's two leading nuclear powers.
 &HT;    Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan could lead to the
dismantling of the global nonproliferation regime based on the 1968
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The
leadership _ or lack thereof _ displayed by the United States and
Russia over the India-Pakistan crisis may well determine whether
the non-proliferation regime endures.
 &HT;    A second challenge is coping effectively with the nuclear legacy
of the Cold War, including the safeguarding of Russia's enormous
stocks of fissile material and the downsizing of Russia's bloated
military-industrial complex. Russia and the United States must both
deepen and broaden their cooperation if these objectives are to be
achieved.
 &HT;    In addition, both parties will increasingly need to cooperate to
combat the problem of terrorism involving weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    Even concerted pressure by the United States and Russia would
probably not roll back the nuclear programs in India and Pakistan.
Instead, Moscow and Washington should take steps to bolster the
nonproliferation concept by ``de-glamorizing'' nuclear weapons and
fostering nuclear disarmament.
 &HT;    With the START II treaty deadlocked in the Russian parliament,
an alternative means of accomplishing this objective would be to
jump-start the disarmament process by taking steps to reduce U.S.
and Russian arsenals of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States
could take a major step in this direction by unilaterally
withdrawing its few remaining tactical nuclear weapons based in
Europe, which have little military value, but enormous symbolic
significance to Russia.
 &HT;    This step would help defuse a potential contest in the region,
where many Russian officials have argued that Russia will have to
increase its reliance on tactical nuclear weapons in response to
NATO enlargement. It could also help revive the stalled START
process, and serve as a first step toward formally codifying the
1991 Bush-Gorbachev declarations on the withdrawal of non-strategic
nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    The United States and Russia should also work together to
support initiatives by non-nuclear weapons states for legally
binding security assurances and the creation of nuclear-free zones.
The five countries of post-Soviet Central Asia _ Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan _ are currently drafting a
treaty to create a such a zone in Central Asia.
 &HT;    Russian and U.S. efforts to publicly encourage and facilitate
this effort would send a positive signal to non-nuclear nations
about the benefits of nonproliferation, and would also have
symbolic importance, given the region's proximity to India and
Pakistan.
 &HT;    One bright area of U.S.-Russian cooperation in recent years has
been joint efforts to increase the security and accountability of
nuclear materials in Russia.
 &HT;    As part of a continuing effort to consolidate former Soviet
nuclear materials and increase their security, Presidents Clinton
and Yeltsin should consider launching a joint initiative to buy up
the relatively small but significant quantities of highly enriched
uranium stored at sites in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Ukraine,
and Uzbekistan. Depending on the political relations among the
parties, some of the material could be returned to Russia, while
the remainder would be exported to the United States.
 &HT;    As part of such a program, Russia and the United States should
also collaborate on refitting the research reactors in these
countries to run on low-enriched uranium, which presents a much
lesser proliferation threat than uranium.
 &HT;    In addition, the United States and Russia should begin to do
more than simply talk about cooperating on issues of terrorism.
Concrete steps should be taken to implement prior
intelligence-sharing agreements, to expand physical protection from
the threat of radiological sabotage and to improve enforcement of
existing export-control laws and regulations.
 &HT;    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in forging a more effective and
coordinated strategy for future U.S.-Russian cooperation is that
proliferation issues occupy a different place in the hierarchy of
national policy in Russia than in the United States. This
different, lower ranking is not because Russian policymakers
disagree with their U.S. counterparts about the dangers of weapons
of mass destruction. Instead, it is a perception of the issue's
minor relevance to the immediate economic and political situation.
 &HT;    President Clinton needs to take advantage of the Moscow summit
to refocus attention on the pressing nature of the proliferation
threat _ a paramount security challenge to both nations and one
that requires concerted cooperation.

 By CAROLEE B. MORRISON  
 c.1998 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.
(In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport in Entebbe, Uganda
and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists
returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>

to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

 By CAROLEE B. MORRISON  
 c.1998 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.
(In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport in Entebbe, Uganda
and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists
returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Apparently his followers view bin Laden as a spiritual
leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, and therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    MIAMI _ In what has become the manner of the times, the newly
proclaimed ``war on terrorism'' is taking on a shrill,
hyper-menacing tone that cannot help the U.S. deal with the
problem. Some commentators seem almost gleeful at finding a
dangerous new enemy to take the place of the Cold War threat.
 &HT;    There is an astonishing intensity in the way news is being
presented to maximize the drama. The TV reports _ and most people
get their news from TV now _ go on hour after hour, with
interruptions only for commercials, the weather and sports, whether
or not they have any information to offer.
 &HT;    It is as though nothing else is going on in the world except
Monica Lewinsky and terrorism. Journalists and ``consultants''
interview each other endlessly on what they think about the facts
they admittedly don't know. They spend so much time on camera that
they can't do much reporting beyond offering themselves as the
audience for ``spin control'' briefings, so they aren't prepared to
ask probing questions.
 &HT;    Even the sober, serious ones, such as Ted Koppel, discuss at
length the Armageddon that the terrorists may be preparing for the
United States. There is some official deliberation behind this. The
government feels a need to arouse people so as to have full support
for future action not yet thought through. Gone is the moderating,
skeptical tone of a Walter Cronkite searching for some perspective
and a basis for independent judgment. The more they talk, the less
they say.
 &HT;    It reminded me of the time when President Kennedy, seeking to
mobilize people for the nuclear-arms race, announced a program to
have everybody build a family atomic-bomb shelter in the back yard.
Fortunately, the idea was soon abandoned. A combination of dismay
and ridicule, and a gradual understanding that terrorizing the
country wasn't a good or sound way to strengthen it, shot the
program down.
 &HT;    The Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who has been around
promoting his nefarious plots for a long time but was unknown
except to Middle East experts, has suddenly provided a face to pin
on the murky image of terrorism. It's as though he could be held to
account for all of it.
 &HT;    Nobody asks for some clarification of just whom the new war is
to be fought against. Only Arabs, or are the Irish, the militant
Israelis, the Japanese cultists, the Colombian and Peruvian and
Algerian guerrillas to be included? Is terrorist some kind of
special breed to be identified by the color of skin, the length of
nose, facial hair, a headdress? Or is it only somebody who hates
Americans?
 &HT;    There is little explanation of the background of bin Laden and
the ``Afghanis,'' the people from many countries recruited to fight
the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan with Pakistani sponsorship and
American supplies and finance. The European press has made the
point.
 &HT;    The Financial Times called bin Laden ``America's Frankenstein,
``a reminder that dirty tricks and covert action spawn more dirty
tricks.''
 &HT;    Even the dangerous implications of the cruise-missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan are brushed aside in the effort to appear
faultlessly resolute. It has only just come out that the deputy
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, was
sent to be in Pakistan when the missiles hit the neighborhood, so
he could convince the Pakistani military that the sudden strike was
not an attack from India.
 &HT;    A misinterpretation of who was targeting whom could have led to
a nuclear exchange between the two subcontinental enemies. That is
an extreme but factual example of why it's bad to stir up
exaggerated fears with worst-case terrorist scenarios.
 &HT;    For myself, I feel obliged to reserve judgment on the missile
strikes. I favor doing whatever is possible to deter terrorism and
punish its practitioners, but we don't know enough yet to tell if
this was a good way and what chances it had of being effective. A
sheer display of destructive power can serve the terrorists'
purposes by heightening tension and hostility.
 &HT;    It was shocking to hear some congressmen and commentators jump
to the assumption that President Clinton decided on the spectacular
retaliation for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to change the
subject from the round-the-clock Monica Lewinsky coverage. In
itself, it showed how much the scandal has damaged America.
 &HT;    There is a problem of credibility, having nothing to do with the
president's sex life but with the way important news is handled and
opinion manipulated. Maybe the American public, having been exposed
to this kind of infodrama since the O.J. Simpson show boosted
ratings, is inured to its insidious effect.
 &HT;    But it isn't reassuring. ``War on terrorism'' can become a war
on sanity.

<P>
   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded
and successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has
fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air power is an unusually seductive form of military
strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to
offer gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.

   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.

<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded

fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.

strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to

for the remediation effort, including the U.S. Army's Technical

Maryland-based TEU has expertise and equipment found nowhere else.

   ``Basically, we're organized and equipped to deal with either a

commander.

take samples to determine if chemical or biological agents have
been released and, if we locate a device, we have the capability to
remove and transport it to the appropriate lab for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Norton said, a basic chemical and
biological-response team is ready to respond within four hours to
any incident anywhere in the United States. In all, the TEU has 83
military members and 99 civilians.

<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

   Ranan Lurie, who is now known internationally as a political
cartoonist and analyst, was a celebrated Israeli army combat major
in the Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   To him it takes hand-to-hand, gutsy commando action to bring
down terrorists, and the idea of firing Tomahawk missiles at a
training camp buried in the mountains is an expensive way of
``saying something you don't really mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, Lurie addresses the strategy chosen by the
United States to enter into what President Clinton is now calling
``a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between
the rule of law and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them. President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now
a very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing
for the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian
Gulf War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the
last war. What I am trying to say is that every terrorist
organization today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S.
retaliation will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States
has established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as
much as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. We
don't want to take a chance of losing lives. Let us remember when
President Carter was trying to save the hostages in Iran in 1980.
He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment failures and a
crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the mission was aborted.
It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who came out looking like a
very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... and as for the men, once you volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, you make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend, or to be higher paid. They would like to
serve, because that is what made them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such a mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid by the Israelis.
(In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport in Entebbe, Uganda
and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of French tourists
returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Apparently his followers view bin Laden as a spiritual
leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, and therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have
to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew very little
about the whole situation in Entebbe because the hijacking and
hostage-taking happened out of thin air. So there was a tremendous
disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in comparison to the U.S.
advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama bin Laden. We have
known for years that bin Laden is organizing something massive for
terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on many occasions. So I
should assume this would make him one of the prime intelligence
targets the United States has in the world today. A person like
this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence operation: the
CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani interest to know what
is happening with him, so their agencies are probably working on
it. And all this intelligence would certainly serve our special
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu, so
that all the world can hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained as well.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the goal had to be destroying the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, I believe about
600,000, on a thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in
the end achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is
correct, but it was like taking candy from a baby, and we did it
with such drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we
had to bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why,
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Apparently his followers view bin Laden as a spiritual
leader, a very principled man, with a belief system that is
unwavering, unflinching ...
</P>
<P>
   A: It's as if you would say that also Hitler was a principled
man. What does it mean? That his principles are that other races
are inferior. Therefore they are execution-prone, and should be
burned in the gas chambers. This is more or less what bin Laden
also thinks: that America is Satan, and therefore we are condemned.
He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and jeers at our
soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor terrorism on
American soil, without any moral hesitation, and establish himself
as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the extremist world. We have
to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20 or 30 very
good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the loss of
millions in a city of the United States.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    MIAMI _ In what has become the manner of the times, the newly
proclaimed ``war on terrorism'' is taking on a shrill,
hyper-menacing tone that cannot help the U.S. deal with the
problem. Some commentators seem almost gleeful at finding a
dangerous new enemy to take the place of the Cold War threat.
 &HT;    There is an astonishing intensity in the way news is being
presented to maximize the drama. The TV reports _ and most people
get their news from TV now _ go on hour after hour, with
interruptions only for commercials, the weather and sports, whether
or not they have any information to offer.
 &HT;    It is as though nothing else is going on in the world except
Monica Lewinsky and terrorism. Journalists and ``consultants''
interview each other endlessly on what they think about the facts
they admittedly don't know. They spend so much time on camera that
they can't do much reporting beyond offering themselves as the
audience for ``spin control'' briefings, so they aren't prepared to
ask probing questions.
 &HT;    Even the sober, serious ones, such as Ted Koppel, discuss at
length the Armageddon that the terrorists may be preparing for the
United States. There is some official deliberation behind this. The
government feels a need to arouse people so as to have full support
for future action not yet thought through. Gone is the moderating,
skeptical tone of a Walter Cronkite searching for some perspective
and a basis for independent judgment. The more they talk, the less
they say.
 &HT;    It reminded me of the time when President Kennedy, seeking to
mobilize people for the nuclear-arms race, announced a program to
have everybody build a family atomic-bomb shelter in the back yard.
Fortunately, the idea was soon abandoned. A combination of dismay
and ridicule, and a gradual understanding that terrorizing the
country wasn't a good or sound way to strengthen it, shot the
program down.
 &HT;    The Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who has been around
promoting his nefarious plots for a long time but was unknown
except to Middle East experts, has suddenly provided a face to pin
on the murky image of terrorism. It's as though he could be held to
account for all of it.
 &HT;    Nobody asks for some clarification of just whom the new war is
to be fought against. Only Arabs, or are the Irish, the militant
Israelis, the Japanese cultists, the Colombian and Peruvian and
Algerian guerrillas to be included? Is terrorist some kind of
special breed to be identified by the color of skin, the length of
nose, facial hair, a headdress? Or is it only somebody who hates
Americans?
 &HT;    There is little explanation of the background of bin Laden and
the ``Afghanis,'' the people from many countries recruited to fight
the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan with Pakistani sponsorship and
American supplies and finance. The European press has made the
point.
 &HT;    The Financial Times called bin Laden ``America's Frankenstein,
``a reminder that dirty tricks and covert action spawn more dirty
tricks.''
 &HT;    Even the dangerous implications of the cruise-missile attacks on
Afghanistan and Sudan are brushed aside in the effort to appear
faultlessly resolute. It has only just come out that the deputy
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, was
sent to be in Pakistan when the missiles hit the neighborhood, so
he could convince the Pakistani military that the sudden strike was
not an attack from India.
 &HT;    A misinterpretation of who was targeting whom could have led to
a nuclear exchange between the two subcontinental enemies. That is
an extreme but factual example of why it's bad to stir up
exaggerated fears with worst-case terrorist scenarios.
 &HT;    For myself, I feel obliged to reserve judgment on the missile
strikes. I favor doing whatever is possible to deter terrorism and
punish its practitioners, but we don't know enough yet to tell if
this was a good way and what chances it had of being effective. A
sheer display of destructive power can serve the terrorists'
purposes by heightening tension and hostility.
 &HT;    It was shocking to hear some congressmen and commentators jump
to the assumption that President Clinton decided on the spectacular
retaliation for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania to change the
subject from the round-the-clock Monica Lewinsky coverage. In
itself, it showed how much the scandal has damaged America.
 &HT;    There is a problem of credibility, having nothing to do with the
president's sex life but with the way important news is handled and
opinion manipulated. Maybe the American public, having been exposed
to this kind of infodrama since the O.J. Simpson show boosted
ratings, is inured to its insidious effect.
 &HT;    But it isn't reassuring. ``War on terrorism'' can become a war
on sanity.

CALL-UPS ONLY MEAN TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fantasy league leaders, the final stage of dread is upon you
_ the September call-ups; the minor league prospects the parent
clubs bring up to take a good look at.
</P>
<P>
   But what it really means is that the Geronimo Beroas of the game
go to the bench and are glued there until the end of the season.
And as much as you have learned to despise him, you really need
Beroa's dwindling number of at-bats each week.
</P>
<P>
   What also happens this time of year is that when your player
(Brady Anderson, for instance) gets hurt, the team doesn't bother
to place him on the disabled list, robbing you of a chance to
replace him with some phenom du jour the Expos, Pirates, Reds or
Tigers are trying out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are contract issues, such as for Wil Cordero and the
White Sox, the sweetest hearts in baseball. The White Sox have
indicated that Cordero, who has an option for next season if he
gets 400 plate appearances, won't get there _ not that he deserves
it. Before you know it, you are down to about eight full-time
players. Your only hope is that the same thing is happening to the
competition. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The killers &QL; 
 &QL; 
For the rest of you owners, especially those destined for fifth,
let's take a warm look at the season's busts by position. For bust
of the year, let's go with Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   American League &QC;
</P>
<P>
   DH _ Geronimo Beroa.

LaTroy Hawkins.

</P>

   Hal Morris and Paul Sorrento win dishonorable mention.

   RP _ Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty impressive list of players having bad years,
especially Thomas and Jaha. In the year of the three-inch strike
zone, juiced baseball and juiced baseball players, when nearly
every big bopper is having a great year, these guys decide to play
possum. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A miracle &QL; 
 &QL; 
Imagine stumbling into Paul Byrd in time to get his two
complete-game victories last week. What a find, especially at this
time of the season, when such miracles are so hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Similar miracles are being delivered by the Diamondbacks with
the emergence of Omar Daal and Amaury Telemaco. Who'd a thunk? &QL; 
 &QL; 
The call-ups &QL; 
 &QL; 
Prospects who could play a lot in September include Marlon Anderson
(Phillies); Emil Brown (Pirates); Edgard Clemente and Derrick

CLINTON'S PROBLEMS LOOM IN CALIFORNIA SENATE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ The first campaign debate between Sen.
Barbara Boxer and Republican challenger Matt Fong saw the first
three questions from panelists centered on President Clinton's
troubles with Monica Lewinsky and Boxer's connections to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a post-debate news conference, Boxer faced a half-dozen more
questions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was a vocal critic of now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas and then-Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon when they
faced accusations of sexual harassment. In addition, Boxer's
daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has said several times she thinks Clinton's behavior was
wrong, that he should have come forward much sooner. She also has
said Californians should be discussing more substantive issues,
such as her record in the Senate and Fong's positions on issues,
and should let the process decide Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, the California state treasurer, wasted little time
Wednesday accusing her of using a double standard with her
Democratic president. He called Clinton's behavior embarrassing and
disgusting and claimed he didn't like his children watching TV news
because of the saturation coverage of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fittingly, the debate was televised live in Los Angeles
on KCAL _ between the ``Jerry Springer Show'' and ``The People's
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boxer went out of her way to say she has a
``zero-tolerance'' policy for sexual harassment in her office, she
said it was up to Lewinsky to decide whether Clinton had engaged in
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been painful, but I think it's been painful for the
American people,'' Boxer said afterward, when asked how the scandal
had affected her personally. ``When a president is under this
cloud, has made a horrible mistake like this, we all feel sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent polls show Boxer and Fong in a dead heat, but Boxer
had at least one great advantage during the debate: Fong's miscues
and occasional vague answers. Fong skipped over phrases, slurred
words and jettisoned his concentration several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara, you're not soft on crime,'' Fong said at one point,
then caught himself and laughed with the audience. He referred to
notes throughout the debate and tried to ridicule Boxer for saying
she had voted against the death penalty 100 times. In fact, she
said exactly the opposite just moments before.
</P>
<P>
   He had trouble explaining some things:
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has nominated judges, uh, has nominated lawyers,
who for a career sue cops and not only sue cops but make their
life, uh uh, earnings giving seminars on how to sue the police. ...
One judge, for example, took a look at a case where a tourist was
shot in the back of the head in Florida and for $4.05 the Florida
Supreme Court gave a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fong's poor performance, the Clinton-Lewinsky problem
dominated the debate, which was held just one day after more bad
news for Boxer: A Field Poll showed her and Fong each with 45
percent support among those surveyed, and only 10 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   For an incumbent with six years in the U.S. Senate, those
numbers aren't encouraging. Even her support from women voters
appeared low in the Field Poll, with the 13 percent advantage among
women she had enjoyed in 1992 now cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's challenged, let's put it that way,'' said
Barbara O'Connor with the Center for the Study of Politics and the
Media at Cal State University at Sacramento. ``So for someone like
Matt, who is kind of steady and not radical and is positioning
himself in the middle of the road, I think he has a very good shot
at the race.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as Boxer pointed out Wednesday, she has yet to place
any ads on TV, the primary source of information for most
Californians. She hasn't sent any mail, and most newspapers and TV
news stations have given the race scant coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was first elected in 1992 after a brutal campaign against
Republican Bruce Herschensohn, who self-destructed in the final
days after Democrats said he frequented a strip joint and bought
pornography. Boxer has long predicted her 1998 re-election campaign
would be close. She said again Wednesday, ``This will be the
toughest race of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Boxer campaign strategist Roy Behr said that
he didn't know when the Clinton-Lewinsky questions would stop but
that he thought voters didn't care anyway and wouldn't make a link
to Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   The senator did her best to sell that message to the assembled
political reporters and TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stand under a cloud and get nothing done,'' Boxer said,
``or we can do what we have to do for the American people. ... I'm
not going to stand under a cloud.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore offered an unqualified
defense of President Clinton at a campaign stop Wednesday night,
saying he was ``honored to serve him'' despite discomfort in the
Democratic Party over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop in San Francisco, Gore did not
specifically mention the Lewinsky matter or comment on the
president's difficulties. Instead, he took the opportunity in the
middle of a stump speech for the Democratic candidate for
California secretary of state, Michela Alioto, to praise the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of the leadership that President Bill Clinton has
brought to the United States of America,'' Gore said, coming off a
two-week family vacation in Hawaii. ``I am honored to serve him and
call him a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's comments nearly mirrored a written
statement he issued from Hawaii after Clinton's Aug. 17 address to
the nation in which he admitted having an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky while she was a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Clinton's would-be successor in 2000, is facing problems
of his own. On Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new
review into whether Gore lied to Justice Department investigators
about his fund-raising activities leading up to the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   At the Alioto fund-raiser, Gore said he had no comment about
Reno's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no formal decision made as I understand it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The highly partisan crowd at the Alioto event, which raised an
estimated $250,000 for her quest to unseat Republican Bill Jones,
stood by the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything there,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., said of the fund-raising allegations. She said the
Justice Department's investigation should clear up questions once
and for all and ``satisfy everyone's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Gore remains an important fund-raiser for
Democratic candidates. His appearance in San Francisco, with his
wife, Tipper by his side, was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore will continue to be a big draw. That's not going to be a
problem,'' said Marion Goodman, California president of the
National Women's Political Caucus. ``Gore is a man of high ethics
and I think all this will blow over.''
</P>
<P>
   She had mixed feelings, however, about the president. She said
he was done a great job in promoting the interests of women. But
when it comes to his personal conduct, she said, ``There's
obviously great disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, a longtime Democratic
representative from California, also lauded Clinton and Gore's
fund-raising abilities. Both, he said, have star power that is hard
to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of candidates who want to be seen with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Democrats are concerned about whether a tainted
Clinton will help or hurt them. Several Democratic congressional
leaders have sharply criticized his conduct in the Lewinsky matter.

IT'S THE LOVE, STUPID

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why is it so hard to believe she actually bought
his lies?
</P>
<P>
   Because she's a lawyer? Because she's got a high IQ? Because
she's ambitious? Because her husband is a politician? Because she's
a feminist? Because she knew he'd cheated before?
</P>
<P>
   What match are those realities against a denial that is fueled
by love and the commitment to a bigger-than-life, multifaceted
marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us out here in the cheap seats may never know
absolutely, positively when Hillary Rodham Clinton learned that her
husband of nearly 22 years had indeed conducted a long-running
sexual affair with a much younger woman. In the White House. Right
under her nose.
</P>
<P>
   According to Newsweek, the president confessed the awful truth
to his wife only a few days before the United States of America got
to hear about it _ on Aug. 13, after an Andrews Air Force Base
ceremony to honor Americans who had been killed in the Nairobi
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting ``knowledgeable sources,'' Newsweek said the first lady
felt ``wounded and betrayed'' and was ``furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, many Americans don't believe this. In public-opinion
polls and on the nation's talk shows, they fairly hoot at the idea
that a woman as savvy, sophisticated and political as Hillary
Clinton didn't know all along.
</P>
<P>
   How could she not have known, they say, when two-thirds of the
country hasn't believed Bill Clinton since the whole sordid story
broke in January?
</P>
<P>
   In a USA Today-Gallup poll, some 34 percent of respondents even
theorized that Hillary Clinton has hung in there with her
philandering husband because she ``likes being first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it woman's intuition (or 48 years of living), but
everything I see in HRC's post-confession body language and infer
from her near-silence leads me to believe that she was _ as the
cliche goes _ the last to know. Each time I watch a rerun of her
now-famous ``Today'' show appearance, I'm more convinced.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who looked Matt Lauer straight in the eye and
confidently defended her husband against the vast right-wing
conspiracy's latest dirty trick likely drew her conviction from but
one source: Her beloved spouse had looked her straight in the eye
and sworn he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   And because she has been crazy in love with him since they met
at Yale Law School, because she has invested more than 25 years of
her life in the ``us'' that they became _ because to allow herself
to doubt would have been to start down a path fraught with danger
and the possible destruction of ``us'' _ she chose to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Women in love with their husbands often do that. Sometimes women
who aren't in love with their husbands do that, too, because the
``us'' they co-created dwarfs individuals and supersedes all else
in importance.
</P>
<P>
   As therapists and couples counselors will attest, lots of women
with high IQs set doubt aside and choose to believe. Ambitious,
successful women who make more money than their husbands choose to
believe. Women with law degrees believe. Even women who fight for
equal pay and opportunity and keep their own names after they marry
choose to believe.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be logical or conform to our one-dimensional ideas
about how ``smart'' women should behave. But the phenomenon is too
common to ignore as an explanation for the first lady's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1992 presidential campaign, I have kept a semi-candid
picture of Bill and Hillary Clinton tacked up in my office. It was
taken by the celebrity photographer Harry Benson for a People
magazine article that appeared a while after Gennifer Flowers'
notorious revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is lying in a hammock with his eyes nearly closed
and his lips slightly parted. His wife's face is perhaps two inches
from his. Her own eyes are cast down and her open mouth _ with the
hint of a smile _ is about to deliver a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   I kept the photo because it was one of the sexiest, most
powerfully intimate portraits of two people in love that I'd ever
seen. I look at it today and think: Oh, sure. She stays just
because she likes being first lady.

MISSILE STRIKE STRAINS FRAGILE US-PAKISTAN TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When US cruise missiles traveled through Pakistani
air space last Thursday to hit suspected Afghan terrorist camps
with links to Pakistani Islamic militants, yet another stress point
emerged in the long, strange relationship between the Washington
and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, Pakistan has been America's most loyal
friend in one of the world's scariest neighborhoods. At
Washington's request and with American aid, Pakistan served as a
bulwark against communism during the Cold War and a counterweight
to India's dominance of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the last three decades have also been punctuated by
conflict. Pakistan felt abandoned by Washington during two wars
with India. Starting in the 1970s, Washington imposed sanctions on
Islamabad for its development of a nuclear program and added new
sanctions three months ago after Islamabad conducted nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the two nations have maintained over the years a
delicate partnership that often has been beneficial to both sides.
Particularly important to the US have been joint anti-terrorism
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But today, relations with Islamabad seem once again in peril.
The Pakistani public exploded in rage last week at the US strike.
One missile reportedly landed in southern Pakistan, although it did
not explode. The Pakistani government filed a complaint this week
to the UN Security Council over US violation of its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistanis claiming to be students at religious schools in
Afghanistan were among those injured in the US strike on the
neighboring country. Some of them were reportedly accompanied to
hospitals by Pakistani intelligence agents. Observers believe that
the presence of those agents exposes Islamabad's covert support for
Islamic militants training in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sanctions imposed after Pakistan conducted
nuclear tests last May have further damaged an already crippled
economy, and they have emboldened radicals bent on discrediting the
current government and fueling anti-United States sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   As the US adopts an uncompromising stand against terrorism,
often without consulting its allies, it risks alienating Pakistan.
If the current strains imperil its government, Islamabad may think
twice about cooperating with Washington in turning over suspected
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is trying damage control, but it is under
tremendous pressure to outright denounce American actions,'' said
Rifaat Hussain, an international relations professor at
Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan feels we have been there every time the US needed
us,'' he continued, ``in 1979, with the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, during the Cold War.'' Also, he said, Pakistan has
captured and handed over to American authorities major terrorism
suspects _ including the mastermind of the World Trade Center
bombing and the killer of two CIA agents in a rampage at CIA
headquarters in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's US missile attack into Afghanistan _ launched
apparently without notifying Islamabad _ occurred just days after
Pakistani authorities detained and transferred to Kenya Mohammed
Sadik Howaida, a suspect in the Aug. 7 attacks on two US embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying sentiment is, `why should we cooperate?''' said
Hussain. ``We cooperate and we get kicked back in the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a roller-coaster relationship, it's true,'' concedes an
Islamabad-based Western diplomat, ``but even during rough patches,
the two countries have always been able to conduct business. At the
same time, there is reason to be concerned about Taliban-style
schools in Pakistan, training Pakistanis.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two days ago (Aug. 25), top US and Pakistani officials met
in London for the fourth round of talks since May focusing on
another delicate subject: Islamabad's recent nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement released Wednesday in Islamabad, both sides
called for resumption of talks between India and Pakistan, and for
the International Monetary Fund to provide a $3 billion financing
package to avert a $30 billion loan default.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pakistani official who spoke on condition of anonymity
downplayed the current tensions, saying there are ``ups and downs
like any other relationship.'' He added, ``We have not seen the
results that we've expected at times, and they have not seen the
results that they have always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But that diplomatic language masks an underlying distrust of
Washington by Islamabad that is three decades old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bombing and the repeated taking of Pakistan for granted
has sent people into absolute outrage,'' said Agha Murtaza Pooya,
editor of a national newspaper, The Muslim. Much of the anger is
directed at Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government, which is
perceived to have ``capitulated to US demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty of popular rage, he said, could be Sharif's
moderate administration. But the long-term victim would be the
bilateral relationship, especially if a radical regime were to
assume power.
</P>
<P>
   Pooya called the 51 year-old US-Pakistani relationship ``an
engaged standoff'' in which the two countries have ``never broken
off, but never really had a consensus.'' He said, ``We have been in
the same bed, but having different dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesim Zehra, a foreign affairs columnist for two Pakistan
dailies, The News and The Nation, explained: ``All along they were
essentially pursuing different objectives.'' The US was worried
first about communism, and later about Muslim fundamentalism.
Pakistan, meanwhile, has worried mainly about arch-rival India.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pakistan has tried to achieve a delicate balance
in its relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, China
and Islamic nations, but it has not satisfied any of them.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, the United States considered Pakistan a buffer
against Soviet domination in Asia. India, a more powerful player in
the region, refused to take sides in the superpower conflict.
Pakistan agreed to host US military bases, and in 1954 and 1959,
signed two military agreements with the US committing Washington to
to aid Pakistan in time of war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, a US spy plane launched from a base in Pakistan was
shot down in Soviet airspace. The USSR vowed to launch a nuclear
strike against Pakistan if a superpower war erupted. This threat
put Pakistan at great risk because of its alliance with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1965, when Pakistan and India fought a war over Kashmir,
the United States cut off supplies to Pakistan. In 1971, when the
two countries fought again over the secession of East Pakistan,
which became the country of Bangladesh, the United States did
little to help Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United States needed Pakistan and its military
support when the USSR invaded Afghanistan. Throughout the 1980s,
the US funnelled billions of dollars through Pakistan to Afghan
rebels and temporarily lifted sanctions against Islamabad. Some of
those fighters later joined the Taliban militia and various
terrorist organizations. After the war ended, the United States
reimposed sactions and refused even to deliver the $1.2 billion in
military equipment for which Pakistan had already paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the womb of that war, parented by the US and Pakistan,
you have the likes of Osama bin Laden,'' Zehra said. In the
long-standing US-Pakistan ``marriage of convenience, were the seeds
of the Afghan `jihad' (holy war).''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she added, for practical reasons, neither Pakistan
nor the United States can walk away from the union. ``The US
controls the IMF, the World Bank, all the lending agencies from
which Pakistan desperately needs support.''
</P>
<P>
   The only solution, she said, is for there to be ``a maturing in
each country pursuing its own national interest _ interests that
have rarely coincided.''

BACHRACH'S LIBERAL LABEL QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As a candidate for the 8th Congressional District,
former state senator George Bachrach promotes himself as the
``unabashed, unapologetic, unreconstructed liberal'' in the race _
a smart message in an overwhelmingly liberal district.
</P>
<P>
   But in his years in the private sector as an attorney and
lobbyist, Bachrach has worked to gain access to government
decision-makers on behalf of corporate clients and
special-interests groups on both sides of the ideological fence.
And he represented businesses in causes that were not entirely
progressive: helping dry cleaners water down a state toxic
materials law; aiding a trash-burning operator with a history of
environmental problems; and advising a developer who went afoul of
public bidding laws and eventually built the ``sick building'' for
the Registry of Motor Vehicles in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach defends his private-sector work and says efforts to
portray him as something other than liberal is a sign that his
opponents are getting desperate and have begun waging a smear
campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep well at night. Just because you call yourself an
unabashed liberal doesn't mean you don't work for a living,''
Bachrach said this week. ``I represented hundreds of clients, and
it's easy to single a few out and distort what happened with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the 10-way 8th District race in the Democratic primary
say there's nothing wrong with Bachrach's work in the private
sector, but that he has opened himself up to criticism because he
has been touting his liberalism as so pure. It might be more
accurate, some suggest, for Bachrach to say he's an unabashed
liberal on schools or health care for seniors, but has also fought
for business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out on the trail with George, sometimes you feel
like you just have to bite your tongue. It goes to candor and
honesty,'' said former state representative Marjorie Clapprood. ``I
don't mind when he speaks to his background, but it's very
frustrating and disingenuous to say you're the champion when you're
not. I guess some of his hyberbole has caught up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach did indeed have hundreds of clients as a partner in the
law firm of Brown, Rudnick, Freed and Gresmer from 1987 to 1995. A
look at some of them suggests that at least during that period of
his career he sometimes set aside his liberal leanings on behalf of
his client.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1989, Bachrach was paid $5,000 to lobby on behalf of
Northeast Fabricare, a dry-cleaners group, and was successful in
excluding a chemical from the draft of the state's toxic use
reduction law. Bachrach said the chemical was not proven to be
harmful and was critical for ``mostly mom-and-pop businesses'' to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   _Bachrach represented the New Jersey-based firm Odgen Martin in
locating a trash-burning facility in Haverhill, arguing against
efforts by the Haverhill Board of Public Health for tighter
emissions standards. The company has had a troubled history,
receiving violation notices from the Environmental Protection
Agency concerning emissions, for example. Questions have also been
raised about the kinds of trash allowed to be burned at the
Haverhill facility and whether dioxin emissions there exceeded
federal standards. Bachrach said the company jumped through all the
required environmental hoops and that he had no knowledge of any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Starting in 1989, Bachrach helped Metropolitan
Structures/Columbia Plaza Ventures in its quest to locate
Massachusetts Water and Sewer Commission headquarters on Parcel 18
in Roxbury. The effort was derailed in part after state officials
said the company failed to adhere to public bidding requirements.
The same company later built the Registry of Motor Vehicles
building on the site, which had to be vacated _ at a cost of over
$14 million _ because of ventilation-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach said that he was fighting for economic development for
Roxbury, had nothing to do with the public-bidding aspect of the
project, and stopped working for the company before the Registry
debacle.

 New approach seen for clogged arteries
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have suspected that atherosclerosis, the
buildup of fatty plaque inside blood vessel walls that can
eventually cause a heart attack or stroke, involves not just
cholesterol but also a condition called inflammation _ an influx of
white blood cells that eat the cholesterol, then hang around,
creating clumps of debris that block arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has not been clear what chemical signals cause
white blood cells to rush in, or how to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   This week, two teams of scientists, one writing in the journal
Nature and the other in Molecular Cell, report on ways to block the
white cells, opening the way for a new class of drugs that would
act differently from the current ``statin'' medications that simply
lower cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams studied a chemokine, or signal molecule, called
MCP-1, whose job is to call white cells to the scene of tissue
injury or damage, like that caused by cholesterol on artery walls.
</P>
<P>
   At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Dr. Barrett Rollins,
a medical oncologist, studied a strain of mice bred to have high
cholesterol and also to lack the gene that makes MCP-1.
</P>
<P>
   His team fed a high cholesterol diet to these mice and to a
control group that had the MCP-1 gene. After 25 weeks, the arteries
in the control mice ``looked terrible, like those of people who'd
been smoking and eating cheeseburgers for years,'' said Rollins. By
contrast, the mice missing the MCP-1 gene were healthy and had 80
percent less atherosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The other team, led by Dr. Israel F. Charo, associate director
of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease at the
University of San Francisco, and colleagues Landin Boring and
Jennifa Gosling, also studied atherosclerotic mice.
</P>
<P>
   They studied mice that had the gene for the signaling molecule
but lacked the gene for the receptor on white blood cells that
reacts to MCP-1. On a high cholesterol diet, the mice without the
MCP-1 receptor got only half as much atherosclerosis as mice in the
control group that had the receptor, Charo said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the studies suggest that drugs to block MCP-1 or
its receptor could be a promising way to treat patients with high
cholesterol. Several companies are working on such drugs.
</P>

 &UR; For in vitro method, 2 embryos could do
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For women hoping to bear a child by in vitro fertilization,
implantation of two embryos may work as well as implanting more,
and it carries a lower risk of multiple births, a new study of more
than 25,000 women shows.
</P>
<P>
   British researchers, writing in the current New England Journal
of Medicine, found that implantation of two embryos yielded the
same birth rate as implantation of three or more, provided the
fertilization process _ done outside the body in test tubes _
yielded at least four fertilized eggs. Having many such eggs boosts
the odds because doctors have more to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David R. Meldrum, scientific director of Reproductive
Partners Medical Group in Redondo Beach, Calif., criticized the
study's design, but said that if doctors let embryos grow for five
days, not merely three, then implanting only two embryos does make
sense. The key is that it is easier to select good embryos when
they are five days old, said Meldrum, who co-authored an editorial
accompanying the research.

 &UR; Calcium said to curb the symptoms of PMS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A study led by researchers at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
New York suggests that calcium may reduce symptoms of premenstrual
syndrome, including mood swings, water retention, food cravings and
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, an endocrinologist, reported this week in
the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology that she studied
466 women aged 18 to 45 who had documented symptoms of PMS. Half
the women were randomly assigned to take 1,200 milligrams a day of
calcium carbonate, in the form of Tums, for three months, and half,
a placebo. Neither researchers nor patients knew who was getting
the calcium. SmithKline Beecham, Inc., the maker of Tums, helped
fund the study.
</P>
<P>
   By the third cycle, calcium appeared to reduce symptoms by 48
percent, although symptoms were also reduced by 30 percent in the
control group. It's unclear why calcium would help with PMS, but it
may restore an underlying physiological imbalance.

NO NEED TO REPLACE CRAZED CERAMIC TILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 30, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The 12-inch-square ceramic tile has been on my kitchen for
five years. Now, five tiles have hairline cracks; it looks like
crazing in the glaze. The tile were put over 1/2-inch plywood over
a subfloor with thin-set mortar. Can they be reglazed, or do they
need replacing?
</P>
<P>
   MARY GUERRIERO, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They cannot be reglazed, but they don't need replacing
either, except for cosmetic reasons. If you can tolerate how they
look, forget about them. The crazing (spider-web type cracks in the
glaze) is superficial, does not go through the tile, and was caused
by a blow to the tile or a defect.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to replace them, you have to chip out the
mortar and break up the tile in order to chip it out altogether. Be
sure you find matching tile before chipping. With the tile removed,
chip out any mortar remaining on the floor. Install a new tile with
thin-set mortar or an adhesive caulk, and regrout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a house with a strong odor of stale smoke. I cleaned
the carpet and that seems OK, but the smell is coming from the
paneling. Someone suggested washing the paneling with ammonia and
water. I also bought water-based polyurehane varnish, hoping to
seal in the odor. Anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE, from Medfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The ammonia and water sounds OK to do because washing the
paneling will do the most good. But instead, I suggest a standard
solution of Spic and Span and water; I think it is still one of the
better cleaners on the market. Wash the paneling thoroughly; the
finish should not be affected, although it might become dull.
Rinse. If that does it, you will not have to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to seal the paneling, do not use water-based
polyurethane; it is incompatible with the oil-based finish on the
paneling. One coat of a satin finish should do it; before coating
the paneling, sand it lightly to roughen the finish. The paneling
will look terrible after that sanding, but after you wipe it with a
damp cloth and let it dry, the new finish should look very good. I
think brushing is best.
</P>
<P>
   Another good cleaner is paint thinner. Use lots of ventilation
when working with it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a new roof installed. I know I have to have two
layers of shingles on there now removed, but one man said I didn't
need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because I don't have gutters. One man
said he would put in a ridge vent, another said I didn't need one.
Now I'm all confused.
</P>
<P>
   GINA VILLA, Milford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because you don't have
gutters? Wrong. You don't need a ridge vent? Wrong, maybe. OK,
let's explain. An Ice &AMP; Water Shield is a strip of rubberized
material 3 feet wide that is put on the eave edge of a roof, under
the shingles. It is designed to prevent water dammed by an ice dam
from backing up under the shingles and into the house. An Ice &AMP;
Water shield does not prevent ice dams. It is routinely installed
when a new roof is put on, because it is the state of the art in
roofing, and is easy and inexpensive to do.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that you don't need an Ice &AMP; Water Shield because you
don't have gutters is wrong, because ice dams can form with or
without gutters.
</P>
<P>
   After all that agony, have the Ice &AMP; Water Shield installed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ridge vent. You may not need one if your attic is
properly ventilated, but you do if it is not. And even if it is
well ventilated, a ridge vent is a good idea, to help air escape
from the attic. A ridge vent is usually done in conjunction with
soffit vents (vents in the underside of the roof overhang), and the
resulting ventilation will help keep the attic cool in summer and
help keep it dry in the winter, two important factors in the health
of a house.
</P>
<P>
   After all that agony, put in the ridge vent; it is best and
easiest to install when the roof is being reshingled. A ridge vent
costs about $10 per foot installed, but is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I cleaned up a white marble mantel with soap and water,
it continued to smell like heating oil. How can I get rid of that
odor?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE PERESMAN, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Marble is absorbant, so you must use an absorbant material to
pull out the oil, and you must use a solvent to activate the oil in
the marble. So, dampen the marble with paint thinner, and sprinkle
baking soda over it, at least half an inch thick. Let it sit for an
hour (you may see the baking soda turn yellow, which means it is
absorbing the oil). Sweep it up and throw it away. Repeat as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Repetition is the secret to success. And rest assured it will
work. The handyman spilled some diesel oil in the trunk of his car
years ago during the energy crisis. But he wiped up as much as he
could, then gave everything the baking soda treatment. Eventually,
every trace of oil _ and odor _ was gone. Other absorbants you can
use are Speedy Dry and cat litter. Both are absorbant clays.

FOR TIMBERLAND, BEIGE MAY HELP ERASE THE RED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timberland Co. calls them ``beige shoes,'' a hybrid between
sneakers and hiking boots. Others refer to them as ``cross trainers
for the new millenium'' or ``SUVs for the feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to compete in a triathalon or drive your Jeep Cherokee deep
into the wilderness? Then beige shoes may be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after it took an apparent fashion hit from Nike Inc.
and recorded the only annual loss of its 45-year history,
Timberland hopes that its turnaround story will continue to be
driven by new products such as this year's beige shoe.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the entire footwear industry could use a lift.
Sales for most companies are ``flat,'' notes new chief executive
Jeffrey B. Swartz, the third generation of his family to run the
Stratham, N.H.-based company now known as Timberland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the reason we have the beige initiative,'' says
Swartz, adding that new products are crucial to success.
</P>
<P>
   In the curious world of leisure footwear, shoes are sometimes
broadly grouped into two categories that have more to do with
styles and market segmentation than they do with color.
</P>
<P>
   There are white shoes, known by the laity as sneakers. Then
there are brown shoes, a cobbler's euphemism for just about
everything from hiking boots to Doc Martens.
</P>
<P>
   Given their popularity with young folks, these categories are
subject to the whims of fashion and wild sales swings.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, white shoes were king, and Nike ruled.
But over the last year or so, sneaker sales have cooled off.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, purveyors of brown shoes ``see a window of
opportunity,'' notes editor Bob McGee in a recent edition of
Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland isn't the only one to see a window of opportunity for
beige shoes, which combine the best elements of white shoes and
brown shoes. (Blend white and brown and get beige.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Nike has been toying with versions of a
beige shoe. The goal is to create a shoe as comfortable and
lightweight as a sneaker but sturdy enough for rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Timberland, its fascination with beige shoes was an
outgrowth of two trends: America's love affair with the
sport-utility vehicle and a growing boredom among exercise
enthusiasts with working out at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, most SUV owners were content to cruise
suburban byways, but as the decade wore on many began to use these
vehicles for the purpose for which they were intended. And when
these off-road explorers finally arrived in the wilderness, they
found they wanted something on their feet other than jogging shoes
designed for treadmills and running tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, something similar was going on at the health club.
Unable to cope with the tedium of the Stairmaster, fitness buffs
were fleeing the gym to jog and bike on mountain trails.
</P>
<P>
   It was for these hearty breeds that Timberland designed the
Gorge MPO, the formal name it has given to its beige shoe line.
(MPO stands for multi-purpose outdoor.)
</P>
<P>
   Combining the leather of a hiking boot with the synthetic
materials used to make sneakers, Gorge MPO shoes are expected to
reach retailers this fall. Depending on the model, the shoes will
have a suggested retail price of $75 to $90.
</P>
<P>
   Price could be a problem, notes McGee of Sporting Goods
Intelligence. Stores are so glutted with sneakers that some
retailers are offering discounts. Will consumers pay 90 bucks for
beige shoes when bargain Nikes abound?
</P>
<P>
   When Swartz's grandfather Nathan bought the Abington (Mass.)
Shoe Co. in the early 1950s, the world of white and brown shoes
wasn't so complex. In a small Boston factory, a Russian immigrant
was content to make shoes for retailers such as Thom McAn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Nathan Swartz left Boston after buying a shoe factory
in Newmarket, N.H. Along with the plant, Swartz and his two sons,
Sidney and Herman, inherited some of the factory's old customers,
including a contract to make boots for L.L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's custodian, a guy named Joe Butler, wasn't overly
impressed with the Swartzes' first effort at making boots. Why
couldn't these big city hotshots make boots that could keep feet
warm and dry through a New Hampshire winter?, Butler demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real Newmarket guy,'' Jeffrey Swartz says of Butler.
``First wave Guadalcanal, a steel plate in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung, the Swartzes rose to Butler's challenge. Nathan Swartz
invented a stitch pattern that stopped leaks. The result was the
Timberland Yellow Boot. Walk five miles in a river, and your feet
would stay dry in Timberlands, the Swartzes boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1973, the boot became so popular that Abington
changed its name to Timberland a few years later, and a boot that
found favor with both college students and construction workers
propelled sales for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As it branched out into boat shoes and casual-shoe lines,
Timberland had another hit in the late 1980s with a boot called the
Euro Hiker.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1990s, though, no one model could carry a company. In
some ways, shoe companies had become like record companies _ every
few months they need a new hit, and in 1995, Timberland didn't have
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new product failed us,'' Jeffrey Swartz says of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And so the company was overhauled to churn out new shoe models.
At first glance, those efforts appear to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, new products accounted for about 50 percent of
Timberland's revenues of $797 million, Swartz says. In the early
1990s, new products generated only about 15 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 1997 profits more than doubled to $47.3 million. For
Timberland's most recent quarter, profits were $1.9 million, up
from $600,000 a year ago. Revenues rose nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wall Street has blown hot and cold on Timberland.
After trading above 85 in May, the stock hit a 52-week low
Wednesday of 47 5/8. On the New York Stock Exchange, Timberland
shares fell 3 1/16 to close at 49 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buckingham Research Group analyst Lee F. Backus,
the entire shoe industry is in disfavor with investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing fine,'' he says of Timberland. ``They're a very
strong brand.''
</P>
<P>
   That strong brand has just been entrusted to Jeffrey Swartz, 38,
who recently inherited the titles of president and chief executive
from his father, Sidney Swartz, Timberland's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Swartz's challenge is to preserve Timberland's heritage
as it develops new products for a changing market.
</P>
<P>
   A company that once made boots for men now sells boots, shoes,
and clothing for men, women, and children.
</P>
<P>
   A company once known for expensive leather footwear is now
offering cheaper lines made with some synthetic materials.
</P>
<P>
   A company that once sponsored the Iditarod dogsled race now
appeals to consumers' social conscience. ``Pull up your boots and
make a difference'' is one theme of a new ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the current environment, it's hard to rely on just one style.
This fall, Timberland is offering about 200 shoe models.
</P>
<P>
   But while Timberland won't rise and fall on the fate of the
beige shoe, it still has high hopes for its Gorge MPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the world demands a beige shoe,'' Jeffrey Swartz says,
``we'll show you what the boot guy can do.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For four months while she was a college student, Nadine
Duplessy bewildered everyone who passed her in the streets of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was the color of copper. Braids hung like soft rope
from her head. Yet when she opened her mouth, she spoke their
language with an uncanny traditional inflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really freaked people out,'' said Duplessy, who was born in
Haiti, came of age in Boston, and at age 20 found herself a walking
anomaly in the city of Chiba, Japan. ``Some people thought I
vaguely had something to do with reggae. Then I took the braids
out, and they thought I was Iranian. There's a large population of
Nigerians in Japan, and even they would come up to me like, `Where
are you from? Because you're not one of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   But where others saw only a question mark, Duplessy saw a
connection. She saw two islands _ one an Asian superpower, the
other an impoverished Caribbean nation _ that shared similar
cultural values, and could share the kind of economic ties that
might spur desperately needed economic recovery in her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that potential link has earned Duplessy, now 24, one of
the first prizes in a new scholarship founded this year by two New
York philanthropists. Established with a $50 million charitable
trust by Paul and Daisy Soros, the Soros Fellowships for New
Americans support graduate study for immigrants and children of
immigrants. Twenty fellows, all in their 20s, were chosen this
year; next year the pool of winners will expand to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to create a fellowship akin to the Rhodes and Fulbright
scholarships, an independent panel for the Soros program selected
fellows with an eye to finding future leaders who have overcome
obstacles to achieve excellence. Only two of the 20 winners spoke
English as a first language; six came to the United States as
political refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants have made great contributions to this country and
throughout the entire history of the United States,'' said Paul
Soros, himself a Hungarian-born immigrant who defected to the US
from the Hungarian Olympic ski team in 1948. Daisy Soros, who
serves on the fellowship's board, was born in Czechoslovakia. ``Our
purpose is to find people among today's immigrants who have the
potential to make such contributions, and to enable them to succeed
in their chosen fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 women and nine men chosen include a former New York
Chinatown gang member now in law school, a child of Indian
immigrants who invented a new prosthetic arm, and one of the last
Russian defectors from the Soviet Union, who escaped from the KGB
at age 17 during a US piano concert tour in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Duplessy, who graduated from Harvard College in 1996 with a
degree in East Asian Studies, is one of three Haitians who received
grants this year.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing her goal of promoting Japanese investment in the
Caribbean, &UR;  &LR; she has temporarily hung up her status as a walking
contradiction inside Japan's uniform society. Instead, she will
stay close to home, starting graduate school next week at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   There, she said, she will explore how to build economic
relationships from the many unseen cultural links that already
exist between the Caribbean and Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the connection defies intuition. Only 10
Haitians are known to live in Japan, according to Haitian
Ambassador to Japan Marcel Duret. But some ties do bind the
far-flung islands. Japan has its own embassy in Haiti, and in 1995,
the Japanese government sent two officials to Haiti as part of an
international corps of election observers. That same year, Japan
spent more than $6 million in humanitarian aid to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For her part, Duplessy instinctively felt the cultural
overlaps when she visited Japan _ from the common diet of rice and
fish to the rigid gender roles separating men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds strange, but being in Japan, there really wasn't
that much of a culture gap for me, and I could easily adapt,'' said
Duplessy, as she sat in a coffee shop near her alma mater in
Harvard Square. ``There is a certain way of talking to people who
are older than you, where you don't talk back to them. And the
kids, they study all the time and their parents really emphasize
that, which is how I grew up in Haiti. We were told that our
studies were our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started making those links, I thought, maybe there's a
way I can connect these two experiences and give something back to
my country,'' Duplessy said. ``I wasn't sure how, but I could see
the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Duplessy learned to create possibility out of
hardship. She left Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for the US in 1985 with
her parents and two sisters. She was 11 years old, and spoke no
English. The brutal, 29-year regime of the Duvalier family was
coming to a convulsive end, and her family hoped to escape a life
where her mother could not find work, and where sometimes Duplessy
found little more in her lunch bag than a peanut-butter sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   But while the world she left behind was one of struggle, it was
also one where she ruled the corridors of her school as a popular,
accomplished student. One where she found strong, silent heroes in
a house filled with aunts, grandmothers, and other female
relatives, many of whom worked.
</P>
<P>
   She was a middle child in an idyllic world _ too young to be
bothered with boys, old enough to build a universe of friends.
Suddenly, she was making secret preparations to flee, unable to
tell even her closest friends because of her family's fear that
others might grow jealous of their break for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point it seemed like all of us weren't going to be able
to leave together, and I volunteered to be the one to stay back,''
Duplessy said. ``The year before at our school we had had this big
carnival, and I was chosen as like a queen for this float, then got
sick and couldn't go. And I kept saying, `I have to be queen next
year! I have to!' But then we all ended up leaving at the same time
anyway. I was so bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of arriving in the United States, however,
bitterness soon gave way to new friends and new stability in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, where her aunt and uncle were
well-known in the city's Haitian community. After one year of
bilingual education and one year at the Woodrow Wilson School, she
was admitted at the Boston Latin School.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trajectory that fulfilled the dreams of her immigrant
parents, who had groomed her for medical school and a prestigious
career as a doctor _ still the most respected profession in their
native Haiti. But then, Duplessy got to Harvard, and something
happened: She took Japanese on a lark, and she loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did my roomates think? Crazy,'' she said of her new
obsession. ``I was the Haitian girl from Dorchester, and out of
nowhere I'm taking Japanese. I was walking around everywhere with
index cards with the English words on one side and the Japanese
characters on the other. It was out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   She quelled her parent's anxieties by promising she would go to
business school. But after leaving Harvard, she cut her own path,
studying Japanese business culture in Tokyo, and then teaching
others about what she had learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what kind of relationship can develop,'' Duplessy
said, aware that the path she has chosen to return home _ via Asia
_ may not be the most direct. ``It's something to work toward. But
if you can get people to listen to your ideas, they may start to
see something they never thought was there. So I'm just going to
keep doing it.''

IBM SWIMS AGAINST THE TIDE WITH HIGH-END APTIVA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that we're all comfortable with the idea of buying really
cheap home computers, IBM Corp. is stepping out with a bold new
strategy _ selling really expensive home computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Aptiva SE7, nicknamed Cobra, is the hottest box IBM has ever
built for home users. It features a 450-megahertz Intel Pentium II
processor, a DVD-ROM drive that can show razor-sharp digital
movies, and a hulking 16.8 gigabyte hard drive, all in a sleek
black case that IBM executives compare to the look of an Air Force
Stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Either you want the fastest thing or you want the best
style,'' said Ellen Reid Smith, vice president of worldwide
marketing for IBM's consumer products division. ``The stealth
series we're bringing out has both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra will come to market after Labor Day and carry a list
price of $2,399, enough to pay for a couple of lesser machines.
Computer buffs with money to burn can also invest in a matching
15-inch flat-panel monitor for $999, available in October.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can buy an entire computer for $999 these days.
But Smith says there's a hunger for high-end hardware. She says
that despite all the hoopla over cheap computers, only about 20
percent of PCs purchased this year will cost less than $1,000, not
including monitor. Meanwhile, machines priced above $2,000 will get
nearly as big a slice &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; about 18 percent of the market. Right
now, said Smith, most of that high-end business is going to the big
direct marketers like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc. Now
IBM is determined to get its share.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad move, according to Aaron Goldberg, executive vice
president of industry research firm Ziff-Davis Market Intelligence.
``What IBM is saying is, there's a person out there who wants to
buy the Cadillac,'' said Goldberg. Indeed, a better example might
be the Dodge Viper, the radical high-end sports car produced in
small numbers by Chrysler Corp. Just adding the Viper to its
product line helped Chrysler sell its lesser models as well.
Goldberg said the Cobra could do the same for IBM's line of PCs.
``There's a certain halo effect that having something really cool
gives them.''

THE PROBLEM WITH CELLUCCI'S `ELECTABILITY'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Joe Malone win?
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, anyone but the state treasurer's diehard loyalists
would have answered that question with a snort of amusement.
Surveys of likely Republican primary voters showed him getting
creamed nearly 3-to-1 by acting Governor Paul Cellucci. Party
leaders were urging Malone to drop his challenge. Their urgings
were punctuated at the party convention in Worcester, where a
crushing majority of the delegates endorsed Cellucci. It seemed
clear that Malone would be looking for work before the year was
out.
</P>
<P>
   That, as they say, was then. Now, less than three weeks out, the
outcome of this battle isn't clear at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's political momentum is gone. It began leaking soon
after the convention, when polls showed him edging Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger, the leading Democratic candidate, with only 40
percent support. By early August, Harshbarger was edging him. If
Cellucci's stock is falling among voters overall, it is probably
falling among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget that Cellucci has never run for statewide
office in his own right. Unlike Malone, who won commanding
victories in 1990 and 1994, and William Weld, who stormed to
reelection four years ago with the widest margin of any
Massachusetts governor in a century, Cellucci's status is unearned.
When Weld up and quit, Cellucci inherited his constitutional powers
and Corner Office keys. But Weld's popularity was never part of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion to acting governor gave Cellucci a year's head
start on his long-anticipated contest with Malone, a natural born
campaigner. Yet instead of using those 12 months to earn the trust
and affection of his party's rank-and-file, he immediately went to
work ingratiating himself with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor showed up at a Teamsters picket line to endorse
the union's strike against UPS. He showed up at a Democratic
gathering in Lowell to endorse Hillary Clinton's $21 billion
day-care scheme. Yet he didn't show up when The Boston Globe
invited him to a forum for Republican candidates. For a while he
even balked at promising to show up for the traditional Republican
Unity Breakfast on the day after the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Like Elliot Richardson in 1984, Cellucci is running as a
don't-hold-my-party-against-me Republican. When Paul Tsongas
retired from the Senate, Richardson _ the former US secretary of
everything, the hero of the Saturday Night Massacre _ was the
choice of the Republican establishment to run for the open seat.
Early polls and conventional wisdom had him soundly defeating the
more conservative Ray Shamie, who had been in the race even before
Tsongas's announcement. Foolishly, Richardson believed the hype.
Presuming that he had the primary locked up, he campaigned openly
for Democratic votes. GOP voters didn't appreciate being taken for
granted. Shamie won in a 25-point landslide.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Cellucci and Malone is not as stark as
Richardson-Shamie. Malone is not nearly as conservative as Shamie,
and Cellucci is no Richardsonian liberal. Moreover, while the
candidates in 1984 were campaigning for an open seat, the fight
this time is between an incumbent and a challenger. Massachusetts
voters are loath to turn out incumbents; Massachusetts Republicans,
who have so few incumbents to begin with, especially so.
</P>
<P>
   But as in '84, one candidate is going out of his way to make
ideology the issue, while the other stresses electability. Cellucci
says, in effect: I'm the better candidate. Malone says: I'm the
better Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci camp is betting that what Republican voters want
most is to hang on to the governor's office. Their strategy has
been to attack Malone as a spoiler, a hopeless candidate whose
selfishness is jeopardizing his party's chances in November. Stick
with Cellucci, the acting governor's ads imply, or big-spending
Dukakoids will once again be running the show.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good pitch, especially to moderates whose Republicanism
turns on party loyalty, not philosophy. But it only works if
Cellucci radiates strength. When polls showed him ahead of every
other candidate, the electability argument was hard to rebut. When
they show him losing traction and slipping behind Democrats, it
becomes hard to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson Malone learned in 1984 _ he ran Shamie's campaign _
is that Republicans thrive when they sharply distinguish themselves
from Democrats and fight hard over principles. For 7 1/2 years, the
Weld-Cellucci record has been one of muting ideological
differences, cutting deals with Democrats, refusing to draw lines
in the sand. The result is that big-spending Dukakoids are already
running the show _ and that Republicans, despite holding the
governor's office, are all but irrelevant in crafting state policy.
</P>
<P>
   Malone calls himself ``the conservative for governor''; his ads
say of Cellucci, ``He really is a liberal.'' But his strategy is
less about labels than about meaning. I'm a Republican who stands
for something, he is telling primary voters. Don't base your vote
on sterile calculations about winnability, base it on your gut
beliefs _ on the reason you're a Republican in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Malone is right: Great parties are built on
philosophy, not pragmatism. But elections are waged in the short
run. Malone has three weeks left to set GOP hearts aflame. It's not
impossible.

SCIENCE PROGRAMS STRIVE TO BE LABORATORIES OF DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WALTHAM, Mass. _ This summer, Julius Wilder spent most of his
waking hours, often seven days a week, conducting painstaking DNA
immunology research that would cause most college students to flee
for the beach. The 20-year-old junior wasn't intimidated or bored
by his experience, however; he was juiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made me excited to enter this world,'' Wilder said
recently between experiments at a Brandeis University lab. ``But I
have to admit it's kind of daunting, at times, to look and see that
there's almost nobody in this world who looks like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades after other disciplines diversified their ranks, or at
least began drawing upward trend lines for women and minorities,
the sciences remain starkly white and male.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, along with Hispanics and Native Americans, accounted for
just 6.5 percent of the job market in science and engineering in
1995, according to statistics compiled by the National Science
Foundation. The comparable figure for women, whose participation in
most careers approaches or equals that of men, was 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these continuing disparities _ perhaps the
largest gender and racial gaps in any profession today _ American
colleges and universities are aggressively pursuing an array of
initiatives directed at ``underrepresented minorities'' and women.
They are doing so despite the assault on affirmative-action and
set-aside programs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the public generally understands the problem,
and it goes beyond just wanting to make the sciences representative
for reasons of principle,'' said Freeman Hrabowski III, president
of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. That institution's
Meyerhoff Scholarship program is considered one of the most
ambitious, successful efforts in the country to move blacks into
the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a national priority to eliminate the gap in the health
status between minorities and the white population,'' Hrabowski
added. ``To reach that goal, the country needs ... scientists who
understand the social and environmental backgrounds of the
populations involved. The sciences need everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity efforts aimed at women and other minorities, some
involving small amounts of money and others entailing millions of
dollars, all have the same goals: to lure their targets into
science education, to maintain their interest in subjects that can
be dry and rigorous, and to lead them into related careers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University, for instance, has a half-million-dollar piece
of a $65 million US government endeavor to develop prototypes for
21st century high-tech computing. About $500,000 of the national
total is aimed specifically at promoting participation by women,
blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Roscoe Giles, deputy
director of BU's Center for Computational Sciences, said there is
an ``overall emphasis'' throughout the project to include members
of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Asians are not considered ``underrepresented minorities''
because their percentages among students and workers in
science-related fields consistently exceed their proportion (3
percent) of the general American population.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis administers a fellowship project in which 25 of its own
students are joined each summer by six high-achieving minorities _
three black undergraduates from the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County and three Hispanics from the University
of Puerto Rico. The idea, funded with a total of $775,000 in
renewable grants since 1993, is to show off the best of the
sciences by paying the expenses of students who otherwise might not
get exposed to a prestigious institution, and letting them work
with some of the country's top academics and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of hands-on, one-student-at-a-time approach is typical
of programs throughout the United States. And, although statistics
show only small progress, participants insist their projects are
steadily chipping away at a historic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent but the success rate, ... based on
hearing from past students who now work in the sciences, is really
good,'' said Joan Press, a biology professor who runs the Brandeis
program. ``We're making headway, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, National Research Council reports show that, from 1977
to 1995, the proportion of all master's degrees in the natural
sciences and engineering earned by blacks rose from 3.9 percent to
5.3 percent; from 3.1 to 5.8 percent for Hispanics; and from 0.4 to
0.5 percent for Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While only nibbling at the edges of the problem in the short
run, the long-range intent of these targeted programs is to change
the image of and atmosphere within the sciences. Most try to do
that at institutions of higher education, thereby creating more
role models, but many initiatives also are designed to reshape the
perceptions of younger females and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Eighty urban teenagers in eighth to 10th grade nationwide,
including three from the Boston area, attended a weeklong camp at
the University of Minnesota earlier this month sponsored by the
Association of Science and Technology Centers and the National
Association of Biology Teachers. The students studied bugs and
plants, but they were also part of a bigger effort to get
youngsters interested in science careers.
</P>
<P>
   _The National Science Foundation, which directs tens of millions
of dollars into initiatives nationwide to attract women and
minorities, began the Black Churches Initiative six years ago. In
that project, adults who run day-care centers and other children's
programs in 5,000 US churches are trained to teach young people
about various sciences.
</P>
<P>
   _The public school system in Hartford, which is 94 percent
minority and is the second-largest in New England, is in the middle
of a five-year, multimillion-dollar project _ funded by the
National Science Foundation _ aimed at tripling the number of its
black and Hispanic students who enter science, math, and
engineering tracks when they go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way we can change the current situation, which badly
needs changing ... is to expose people to the sciences earlier, and
in a positive, appealing way,'' said Steven Zottoli, a biology
professor at Williams College who administers a $900,000 grant
directed toward women and minorities at his school, as well as two
other projects with the same targets.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the public National Science Foundation, which was
established by Congress, the most vigorous advocate for women and
minorities is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. ``We very much
have taken on as one of our goals to get a full cross-section of
American society into the sciences,'' said David Jarmul, a
spokesman for the Maryland-based institute, which is primarily a
research facility with a $500 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes Institute spends about $90 million a year on
educational efforts outside its walls, much of it intended directly
or indirectly to diversify the sciences. The Brandeis and Williams
College programs are both funded by Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others are a $300,000 project called CityLab, run out
of Boston University's School of Medicine and designed to expose
high school students to scientific research; a $2.25 million
program at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, which seeks
to better train that city's teachers in science-teaching skills;
and $2.6 million in subsidies to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for summer programs for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may disagree about the remedy, but there's no question
that it's an insane situation,'' said Giles of Boston University,
referring to the racial and gender gulf in the sciences. ``It's so
big that you have to do something.''

OK, SO I WASN'T EXACTLY RIGHT

   (itals)``Now comes the iMac _ clean, elegant, floppy-free _ and
doomed.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   HIAWATHA BRAY, MAY 14, 1998 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines wanted to
carve these words on my tombstone after reading my skeptical view
of the new iMac. But they let me live, and so I shall treat them to
a minute's gloating at my expense.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac doomed? Faugh! They're selling faster than Powerball
tickets. And some early surveys suggest that many buyers are people
who have never owned a computer before, or people who have had it
with Microsoft Windows and crave the simplicity of the Mac OS
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And check this out _ despite the iMac craze, Apple is producing
enough machines to meet demand. This may be the best news of all.
Apple's huge losses of recent years were  &UR;  &LR; in large part due to the
firm's inability to ship enough merchandise to stores during the
holidays. The iMac story suggests that Apple's new management team
is on its way to licking that problem.
</P>
<P>
   So the iMac is selling well, and Apple is off the critical list.
Cigars all around.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I've been playing with a loaner iMac for the past week,
and I find the experience as underwhelming as I &UR;  &LR; had expected. I
plan on giving the machine a more thorough test _ in fact, I've
persuaded my bosses at the Globe to buy me one for use in the
newsroom. But If I was spending my own $1,300, I'd still opt for a
PC and leave the cute little Mac on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, there's still the matter of that missing floppy disk
drive, and the absence of serial and parallel ports. Apple
partisans are ready with a litany of excuses _ nobody uses floppy
disks anymore, and the iMac has universal serial bus ports in place
of the old serial and parallel ports.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the iMac lacks useful features
available on the cheapest PC. Apple forces its customers to spend
hundreds more on external floppy drives and USB printer adapters,
then expects them to be thankful for the extra expense. Everybody
would howl if Microsoft pulled such a stunt. But Apple can spit on
its faithful customers and convince them it's raining.
</P>
<P>
   I've got a few other hardware gripes. The iMac mouse, for
instance, is the worst ever. It's a small cylindrical gadget that
looks like half a yo-yo. Most mice have an oblong shape, and a few
minutes with the iMac mouse reminds you why _ more support for the
hand and wrist. The iMac mouse offers almost no support at all.
Thank heaven that you can easily replace it. To its credit, the
iMac worked perfectly with a USB mouse from Logitech that was
designed for use with PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac's built-in speakers are nearly as bad as the mouse,
though in fairness, most PCs also come with lousy speakers, and you
can always upgrade. The iMac also uses the same kind of flimsy
CD-ROM drive found on laptops, not the big, heavy kind found on
desktop PCs and the more costly Macs. Will the drive survive years
of heavy use? I have my doubts.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the keyboard, though thin and light, has an
excellent feel. And the built-in 15-inch monitor is as sharp as any
I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is talking up the brute speed of the iMac's Power PC
processor, claiming it's faster than any Pentium II. I haven't
benchmarked the iMac, but CMP Media Inc. has run tests on a variety
of Apple systems using Power PC chips. The results won't thrill
Apple execs. CMP Media found that Power PCs are indeed faster than
comparable Pentium II chips. As a result, Macs tend to be faster on
programs like Photoshop, which require massive amounts of raw
processing power. But the &UR;  &LR; Macs were actually slower on mundane
tasks like word processing and spreadsheets _ the kinds of things
most people do with computers.
</P>
<P>
   So am I warning readers away from the iMac? Not at all.
Certainly not after setting it up, and going from box to Internet
in a matter of minutes. Ease of use counts for a lot in my book,
and the iMac has it in spades. If you want a simple, high-quality
machine, and you don't mind spending a few hundred bucks on extras,
you'll do fine with an iMac. It's clean, elegant, floppy-free _ and
definitely not doomed.

THE NUMEROLOGIST'S PREDICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 18 months ago my husband was in a mellow frame of mind. In
his early 60s, he was ready to take the long view. Though he might
not have reached his full potential, he felt he had much to be
proud of. He was satisfied to have reached the stage of life when
his career and personal ambition were winding down. He'd begun to
feel he could use a lot more golf in his life.
</P>
<P>
   For his birthday in April, however, his friend Rick gave him
what I thought was a rather odd gift, a visit with a numerologist
named Louisa Poole. That name conjured up in my mind images of a
little old lady from a child's story, someone bent and wrinkled who
pretends to read tea leaves or crystal balls, a figment of
someone's imagination. I thought Jack felt the same until he
reached for the phone to make an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack, you don't believe in that stuff,'' I said. ``Don't call
her. No one can read the future.'' He ignored me. ``Hon, you know
it's only a combination of guesswork and flattery. You're too grown
up for this kind of foolishness.'' He began rifling through his
date book. ``OK, go,'' I said, ``but don't expect me to take one
word of what she says seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack returned from his reading in a pensive mood. Poole had
informed him, among other things, that it was too soon to think of
resting on his laurels. She'd said that he had important work still
to accomplish on this earth, that his greatest challenge was before
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she say what it was?'' I asked. No, she hadn't. ``Do you
have any idea what it might be?'' No, he didn't. So for months Jack
tried asking friends and family what they thought his great
undertaking might be. No one had a clue. I was convinced that Jack
would eventually forget all about his mysterious unfulfilled
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how this story ends.
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand that for years Jack has worked as a
psychiatrist one afternoon a week at the Lynn Community Health
Center, treating folks with few resources, many of whom are recent
immigrants. Clinic patients, with little in the way of emergency
backup, have a poor record of keeping appointments, but after
Poole's reading, Jack came up with the idea of setting up a weekly
walk-in clinic where parents and children could receive immediate
care. As the walk-in clinic gained in popularity, the focus of
Jack's life shifted.
</P>
<P>
   He set up more mental health walk-in clinics. This fall, he'll
cut back his private practice to spend a second afternoon in Lynn,
supervising an in-house training program for psychiatric nurse
clinical specialists. It's now almost impossible to get his
attention in the evening. He's thinking of ways to integrate newly
hired personnel, planning training sessions, and working on clinic
problems in all his waking hours. Whenever Jack falls silent, I
know he's revisiting the clinic in his head, brooding, worrying,
and obsessing over every snafu.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I've been wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Did Poole truly foresee that Jack would catch fire about meeting
the needs of the people he serves, or did her words actually create
the readiness in him to seize an available opportunity? That's a
question you have to answer according to your own beliefs, but if
Nelson Mandela is right and our deepest fear is not that we are
inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure, if he is
correct that it is our light not our darkness that most frightens
us, many of us need someone else's encouragement to let that light
shine.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela says, ``We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant,
gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world.
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people
won't feel insecure around you. We are born to make manifest the
glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's
in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In my own life, others have looked into my future and seen me in
roles I could not envision myself. ``You are a wonderful writer,''
my grandfather said to me when I was still small enough to sit on
his knee. A swimming coach, a teacher, my mother, all predicted
without a shred of evidence that I would compete in the Nationals,
go to Wellesley, and find a man who would appreciate me. They were
only guessing, I think. And they were all right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is all it takes to see into the future:
</P>
<P>
   Faith in one another's greatness.

DEAR STUDENTS: KEEP YOUR GOODS IN YOUR PANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLA LA FAVE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Green hair doesn't bother me.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do dog collars, multiple earrings, or three-inch
fingernails painted black. When schools starts in my district, 150
students will come through my classroom and I will see all that and
a few new accessories. Most of them are expressions of rebellion _
ways of saying, ``Hey, I'm different. Look at me.'' They're largely
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't want to see anyone's underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The only trend that really bothers me is the one that dictates
guys wearing jeans four sizes too big and low around the hips in
order to expose a couple inches of boxer shorts, or girls wearing
low-cut tops that show a fair amount of bra.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I'm shocked, or that the underwear in question is
shabby. On the contrary, it's usually brand new and purchased for
an audience. What bothers me is that this is not an expression of
rebellion, but a mere fad.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose in some ways it's no worse than a lot of past fads _
chest hair-exposing leisure suits or mood rings or false eyelashes
_ but since it's not intended to shock, it places me in an awkward
position. I don't mind disciplining a student for unruly behavior,
but I'm uncomfortable taking a kid out in the hall in order to tell
him to pull up his pants up or to ask her to put a jacket on so I
can't see her bra.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing conversations are ridiculous:
</P>
<P>
   Me: John, please pull your pants up. I don't want to see your
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   John: Why? They're new.
</P>
<P>
   Me: That doesn't matter. It's not appropriate for them to show
in class.
</P>
<P>
   John: My mom bought these for me. She doesn't care. Why should
you?
</P>
<P>
   Because I'm not his mother, that's why. I teach math, not
fashion sense, and while he may not have any trouble concentrating
on plane geometry while his Fruit of the Looms are showing, I do.
</P>
<P>
   The line between public and private behavior has been blurring
for a long time now. The media get most of the attention in this
area, as the evening news looks increasingly like a tabloid show,
but the more subtle problem is that a lot of our kids don't have a
sense of audience. They think that if it's OK to do something at
home, it's OK to do the same thing at school. They think that just
because their mother is willing to look at their underwear, I ought
to be willing to look at it too. And that's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So students, when you're back in school, your green hair is just
fine. Wear dog collars if you like; paint your nails in yellow and
orange stripes. Dress all in black or mix flowered shirts with
plaid pants. None of that will faze me a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure I don't see your underwear.

LESSONS OF A HILLSIDE MEADOW LEARNED _ BUT NOW, THE MOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we bought our home nine years ago, I saw opportunity in the
small hill out back.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of tall grass rose to a stand of young white pines. To one
side was a copse of saplings and shrubs, including high-bush
blueberries, maples and birches. I envisioned paths winding up and
into the forest beyond. I wouldn't even try mowing the grass. A
hillside meadow. Just the thing.
</P>
<P>
   And for several years, that's what we had. Oh, I never blazed
paths, and the birds ate most of the berries. But I did whack out
oak and white pine saplings and sumac in the copse, where we now
have a lovely and growing stand of birches.
</P>
<P>
   The hilly meadow filled with grasses blowing in the wind and
wild flowers, with an especially nice late show of goldenrod.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few briars cropped up, and a few more. A couple of small
junipers emerged. Some white pines arose. Wild white roses were
welcome at first, then turned into a rampaging thug that, with some
other viney things, have taken over the hillside. Alders and
cherries joined the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! What is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're looking at there are the initial stages of
succession,'' Richard Doherty, a horticulturist and educator, told
me recently.
</P>
<P>
   Succession happens when cleared land is let go. First grasses
take over, then herbaceous perennials, then shrubs, and then trees.
And not just any trees, Doherty said, but conifers. In our area,
that means primarily white pines. Conifers germinate best in
sunlight, while hardwoods will come up in some shade. So later,
hardwoods such as maples and beeches and oaks take over, producing
a so-called climax forest that is a mix of species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your climax stage really depends upon your area and the
species you have in that area,'' said Doherty, who heads the JCC
Horticultural Therapy Program, which provides horticultural therapy
for people with HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   South of Boston, it is likely to be the oak-pine complex. On
Cape Cod, Doherty suggested, the climax stage seems to be housing
complexes, but perhaps he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Change has always characterized the New England landscape,
according to Richard Stomberg, who is manager of the Organismic and
Evolutionary Biology Glasshouses at Harvard University. Be it
glaciers or Pilgrims, things have not stayed put, certainly not the
vast white pine forests that greeted the colonists. Inexorably, the
forests were felled for shipbuilding, other lumber uses, firewood,
and to make way for farms.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 19th century, Stomberg said, people began leaving
for the Midwest. Farmers in particular left the stony, bony fields
of New England for greener pastures. ``And at that point, the
farmland began reverting to forest,'' Stomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that white pine is a particularly good colonizer
of open ground,'' he said. By the turn of the century, ``there was
almost a monoculture, just a huge carpet of white pines.'' That
triggered a new wave of logging, from 1900 to 1920. When the white
pines were cut, they didn't replace themselves, while hardwoods
were quick to take advantage of the clearings. This produced mixed
forests, ``and that's sort of where we are now,'' Stomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stomberg said, ``when you fly over New England, what you
see is trees.'' It is not static, though. Development continues,
especially housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our landscape in New England is constantly being disturbed,''
Stomberg said, ``and that's why our landscape is such an
interesting patchwork.''
</P>
<P>
   It tells stories, too. Sight down a stone wall in the woods, he
said, and you may well see two distinctly different forests on
either side. That is because the stone wall was probably part of a
farm, separating different uses. A woodlot and a pasture would have
different succession stages a century on. So-called pasture
junipers generally spring up in fields, so if you find some hanging
on in the woods, it means that forest may be a succession to a
pasture, Stomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   And my hillside? Yes, it is going through succession stages, and
unless I want trees, I'll be mowing it soon. Well, I sort of knew
that. Thinking that something would come easy was just a stage I
have now outgrown.

   Q: Why does Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile Soap have strange sayings
and political statements all over its packaging?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.S., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: According to interviews, the labels are used to present Dr.
Emanuel H. Bronner's philosophical and spiritual beliefs because no
one else would publish them.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: ``Absolute cleanliness is Godliness, teach the Moral
ABC that unites all mankind free, lightning like, 5 billion strong
and we're One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of philosophy you get is proportional to the size
of the container,'' William Poundstone writes in ``Bigger
Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronner, who began selling Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap in
1949, died in March 1997 at age 89. His soaps and other products
can be found in many health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get my name off of mail and telephone marketing
lists?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.L., Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: To reduce the amount of nonprofit and commercial mail you
receive, send your name and address to: Mail Preference Service,
Direct Marketing Association, Box 9008, Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008.
</P>
<P>
   The DMA offers a similar do-not-call phone service. Send your
name, address and telephone number to: Telephone Preference
Service, Direct Marketing Association, Box 9014, Farmingdale, NY
11735-9014.
</P>
<P>
   These services reduce the amount of mail and phone calls but
don't eliminate them completely. Numerous national direct-marketing
companies participate in the programs, but their use is voluntary.

A GRAPE PERGOLA HOLDS UP HISTORY _ AND A PROFUSION OF VINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vines are climbing in popularity these days, and so are garden
structures, with clematis, wisteria, and roses spreading up and
over trellises, arbors, and pergolas. When my husband and I bought
our farmhouse, we inherited a vine hardly in vogue but whose roots
go deep in New England soil. Parallel to the garage were a row of
hoary Concord grapevines planted 8 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   When we think of grape arbors today, the images that come to
mind range from boutique wineries with French varietals to
neighborhood back yards that yield grapes for grandfather's wine
and leaves for dolmas. But grapevines are also part of the
indigenous old New England landscape. When Leif Ericson arrived, he
found so many wild grapes growing in the New World that he
christened it Vinland. And the name Martha's Vineyard is another
testament to the vigor of wild American grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The climate here was too harsh for the grapes of Europe, so they
became status symbols. The wealthy erected greenhouses, the first
being at the Lyman Estate in Waltham, Mass., where vines planted in
1804 are still maintained by the Society for the Preservation of
New England Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a tasty, cold-hardy grape became an amateur
pastime in the mid-1800s. In 1843 Ephraim Wales Bull, a neighbor of
the Concord, Mass. transcendentalists, planted seeds from a wild
grape that had probably naturally cross-pollinated with a nearby
Catawba grapevine hybridized by a Maryland woman.
</P>
<P>
   When the seedlings bore fruit after six years, Bull named the
tastiest one after his hometown. He unveiled it at a Massachusetts
Horticultural Society exhibition in 1852 as ``a grape for the
millions,'' meaning people who couldn't afford a glass house. The
Concord grape became an instant sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hovey &AMP; Co., a famous Boston nursery, offered it commercially
two years later and soon the Concord grape was heading west into
Missouri as a tough, hardy, almost foolproof grape for homesteaders
who wanted an all-purpose table and jelly grape, said Christie
White, program coordinator for horticulture at Old Sturbridge
Village, which maintains a Concord grape arbor.
</P>
<P>
   While most antique New England-bred fruits are now mere
curiosities, the Concord grape is almost unique in holding space on
modern supermarket shelves. That's thanks to a New Jersey dentist
named Thomas Welch, who used Concord grapes and Louis Pasteur's
pasteurization process to invent grape juice that wouldn't ferment
(Welch didn't think much of the use of wine at communion
ceremonies). Today we have Welch's Concord Grape Juice and Concord
Grape Jelly. Though the grapes are mostly produced in upstate New
York, Michigan, and Washington state, the Welch Foods Inc.
headquarters are in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when my grapevines were planted. Obviously they
went in after 1854, but maybe not long after. Grapevines can live
hundreds of years, and if there's any variety that can withstand
neglect, it's the Concord grape.
</P>
<P>
   When I first met them, my vines were brazenly sprawling on the
ground amid the ruins of the latest in perhaps a long line of
trellises. Their stubby trunks were 3 inches thick, their canes
reaching out in all directions like the tentacles of inquisitive
octopi. The supports had probably just collapsed under the vines'
combined weight, but the sinewy brown canes looked almost capable
of pulling them down.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with pride of new ownership, my husband immediately built
a new trellis of boards nailed to cedar poles. We also did some
restorative pruning, but not consistently enough.
</P>
<P>
   The vines yielded some gallons of grape juice and lots of food
for birds. The perfectly round, deep-purple grapes would develop a
glaucous sheen and turn from sour to sweet if left on the vine
until after first frost. But each bunch of grapes consisted of only
about a few perfect orbs, each full of seeds and mostly hidden by
beautiful leaves. Our grapevines were mainly a vertical bird
sanctuary, favored particularly by nesting catbirds.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade, the resurgent vines were twisting and
dismantling the 2-by-4 crossbeams. I came up with what I thought of
as the $1,500 Solution.
</P>
<P>
   This was the initial estimate from Glenn H. Johnson of South
Shore Improvements in Hingham, Mass. on what it would cost to build
a modest new arbor that would give our exuberant grapevines
something substantial to tackle and would create a sheltered spot
under which to sit.
</P>
<P>
   I was inspired by my next-door neighbor's Concord grape arbor, a
low but sturdy cedar structure that framed the view of their front
porch and the lightning-splitter dormers of their gothic 1814
farmhouse. It was the most beautiful scene on the street in winter
when the vines became a leafless sculpture piled high with snow.
</P>
<P>
   Before we began building, we hired horticulturist Michael Talbot
of Boston to prune our vines. He whacked them back with a
decisiveness we had never mustered. They looked like dead tree
trunks, except they were bleeding sap.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to use concrete footings for the new arbor, so
Johnson dug 3-foot-deep post holes and filled the bottom with large
rocks. After the sturdy 6-by-6 posts of Southern yellow pine were
erected, he filled in around them with gravel and small stones so
they had drainage and didn't come in contact with soil that could
rot them. The crossbeams are 2-by-6s.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand dollars (actually $4,835) and many decorative
modifications later, Johnson had created an impressive structure 8
feet high, 10 feet wide, and 43 feet long spanning the northeast
length of our perennial garden. It was the Titanic of grape arbors,
or in Johnson's words, ``a monster.''

WE HAVE TO TALK 
Healing Dialogues Between Women and Men 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey &QL; 
Basic Books, 225 pp. $23 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You are washing the dinner dishes, and your wife is drying. She
asks you why you are silent. It is debatable (to you) that you are
being silent, but you concede the point and say that you don't
know. She says, ``Let's talk about it.'' At that point you: a) ask
her about her mother; b) talk with her about what you are feeling
and listen to what she may be feeling; c) excuse yourself to put
out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered b), you may not need to read this book. If you
tried a), reading this book could save your marriage. If you
answered c), you have to sit down, read it, and summarize the main
points to your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``We Have to Talk'' is simply a how-to book. The
authors, Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey, thoughtfully examine the
different relational styles of men and women and how they got that
way. They look at the inevitable disconnections that occur between
the sexes and argue that, with effort and creativity, those
differences can be used to move into deeper intimacy. Indeed,
working through the impasses to achieve and nurture connection,
they find, is both healing and the core of healthy relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Have to Talk'' builds on work done at the Stone Center at
Wellesley College, where Shem, a psychiatrist, and Surrey, a
clinical psychologist, are faculty members. The writers, who are
married, lecture together and for 12 years have led workshops, or
gender dialogues, around the country. Shem is also the author of
three novels, ``The House of God,'' ``Fine,'' and ``Mount Misery.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a crowded marketplace of books on this subject, and the
authors thus strive to claim new ground. The result is some
repackaging of the basic realities of a committed relationship _
e.g., that there is a ``we'' in addition to an ``I'' and a ``you''
_ in the latest discourse of feminist psychology. That discourse is
so much in the assumed foreground, that, for example, there are
almost no references to the women's movement, while the reaction to
it, the men's movement, is cuttingly analyzed and repeatedly
fingered for the blame. Older theories of self, the authors write,
represent a status quo that is ``hierarchical, violent, fragmented,
disconnected, and isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   I also have trouble with the stereotype of men. The men whose
voices we hear are, by and large, clueless dummies who would rather
``be in their caves,'' e.g., fixing things, changing the oil in
their trucks, or sitting in sullen silence rather than relating,
men who are puzzled and stung by the anger of their spouses. The
description of women's ways is more alert to stereotyping, on the
other hand. A half-dozen times, for example, women object to being
perceived as the ``experts'' at maintaining relationships.
</P>
<P>
   That gender jeremiad expressed, ``We Have to Talk'' is a useful
book. Shem and Surrey's jumping-off point is research done by Jean
Baker Miller and others at the Stone Center, and by Deborah Tannen
and Carol Gilligan, which found that women's psychological growth
is oriented not toward individual autonomy but toward human
connection, toward the building of mutual and growth-fostering
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Gender differences are hardly unknown, as John Gray showed with
the popular success of his 1994 bestseller, ``Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus.'' But Shem and Surrey move in a new
direction. Rather than reifying these differences and inviting
people to exploit them to manipulate the other gender, the authors
propose ``holding'' them in a empathetic effort to understand the
other as a way to foster connection.
</P>
<P>
   The book identifies three obstacles that affect everything from
choosing a restaurant to having sex. They are: male relational
dread, which is contrasted with women's yearning for connection,
the male focus on product against the female focus on process, and
power over versus power with. Building on much current research,
they find that these inclinations are rooted in early development
of boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Shem and Surrey show their couples ways of stepping
back from these impasses, of hearing out the other not from the
defensive posture of self or gender identity but from the ``we.''
When they succeed in doing this, things begin to happen, and the
value of their approach, and this book, is clear. Shem and Surrey
describe it as a kind of yoga stretch: ``Every moment presents an
opportunity to stay in connection and grow, or disconnect and
retreat into old patterns of unresolved or avoided conflict. ...
(Doing so) is not easy, not always graceful, and not always
possible in any given moment. But staying with it eventually gives
birth to something new.''

SECOND RATE? CERTAINLY NOT THESE RIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They called him Second Place Jesse.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Jesse Stahl, a bronc-bustin' African-American
cowboy from California whose life span straddled the waning years
of the past century and the first third of the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, in the estimation of some old hands, was the best in his
day at the business of riding uncooperative horses _ even better
than the legendary ``Booger Red'' Privett. But that is a matter of
opinion. Suffice it to say that Second Place Jesse was in the same
league with Booger Red.
</P>
<P>
   Now the truth was that he bested the whole field most of time,
but he had to agree ahead of time to take second-place money or not
be allowed to compete at all. On one of those occasions, Stahl is
said to have ridden his next bronc turned backward in the saddle to
display his disgust.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of rodeos, very few black cowboys were
permitted to show their stuff in contests with white cowboys. Stahl
and the legendary bulldogger Bill Pickett were among the few
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett was the first African-American cowboy inducted into the
Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City. Stahl was (what else?) the
second.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, African-American cowboys confined themselves
to smaller, black-only rodeos, although there were many more who
would have ranked among the best at the sport. Black cowboys, after
all, figured prominently in the cattle culture of the 1870s and
1880s.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, about a fourth of the men who drove the
millions of longhorns up the Western Trail, the Chisholm Trail, the
Goodnight-Loving Trail and other routes to the railhead markets in
the central Plains states were African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That is a part of American history that was obscured until
recently by western movies and novels that for the most part left
African-Americans and Hispanics out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two decades, major strides have been made in
correcting those sins of historical omission, both in terms of
academic representations and in the realm of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Professional rodeo has opened its chutes to African-Americans,
and many have done well in Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association
events. The list includes all-around cowboy Marvel Rogers; bull
riders Myrtis Dightman, Charles Sampson and Ervin Williams;
bullfighters (also known as rodeo clowns) Dwayne Hargo and Leon
Coffee; and calf roper Fred Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Sampson became the first black cowboy to win a national
championship. In 1990, Whitfield became the first of his race to
achieve the distinction of national calf-roping champion.
</P>
<P>
   Although black cowboys constitute a relatively small percentage
of the card-carrying PRCA membership, their numbers are growing.
Many are earning their spurs in local and regional rodeos as well
as touring competitions such as the Bill Pickett Rodeo and Cleo
Hearns' Cowboys of Color Invitational Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pickett Rodeo, which has visited Fort Worth several times,
is an exclusively African-American rodeo that features the
traditional rodeo events of roping, bronc-bustin', bull riding,
steer wrestling and barrel racing, as well as other exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it even has a steer wrestler attempt to demonstrate
Pickett's famous feat of biting a steer in the upper lip and
throwing it to the ground using only his teeth and his body weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys of Color Rodeo, which will play the Will Rogers
Coliseum at 7 p.m. Sept. 5, is a tri-ethnic show. It will present
more than 300 African-American, Hispanic and Native American
cowboys and cowgirls in competition and exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen previous editions of that rodeo here, at the
State Fair in Dallas or other venues can tell you that it offers
thrill-a-minute, exhilarating entertainment that ranks with the
best of its kind. There is nothing second place about it.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, Cowboys of Color is a living history lesson,
a spectacular exhibition of pageantry and action that celebrates
the diversity of the American West of yesterday and today.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how to participate in this entertaining historical
tribute, call the Renaissance Cultural Center at (817) 922-9999.
They'll be more than happy there to tell you where to get tickets
in advance, because the center will be one of the main
beneficiaries of the event.

CLINTON'S OTHER BIG LIE, AND HOW IT HURT HIS YOUNG WARRIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Stephanopoulos says he's still burning from
the first time Bill Clinton got him to lie. It was in 1992 when the
then-Arkansas governor was being grilled about his Vietnam draft
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months, we had been defending against the charge of draft
dodging,'' the former Clinton spokesman writes in the latest
edition of Newsweek magazine. ``I was right there on the ramparts
... insisting that Clinton had never been drafted and never pulled
strings ... that this obsessive focus on Clinton's past was part of
a right-wing plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit. A reporter for the Associated Press confronted
Stephanopoulos with a copy of Clinton's draft notice, the document
the presidential candidate had been denying for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this be?'' he remembers grilling himself on what he
calls the ``worst morning'' of the '92 campaign. ``How come the
governor didn't tell us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot about it,'' Clinton told him, urging his young,
ambitious warrior back to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Though far too young for the Vietnam generation, Stephanopoulos
has enough moxie to know that no guy forgets getting drafted. His
candidate ``forgot'' getting drafted in April 1969 because he
didn't want to explain how he had manipulated a local ROTC
commander to get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Stephanopoulos was that Clinton could so calmly
lie, so coldbloodedly get his loyal people to lie for him.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the same pattern in the president's seven-month
stonewall on the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that Clinton defiled his presidency by having
sex with an intern (in a room) off the Oval Office; bad enough that
he humiliated his wife and daughter. But President Clinton turned
his personal flaws into a public matter when he made the whole
country complicit in his cover story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no impulsive act of passion; it was a coldly
calculated political decision. He spoke publicly from the Roosevelt
Room. He assembled his Cabinet and staff, and assured them that he
was telling the truth. Then he sat back, silently, and watched his
official spokespeople, employees of the U.S. government, mislead
the country again and again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   What strikes me is the irony buried here: that Vietnam and the
home-front, youthful resistance to that war once again should
explode into American politics like a land mine left behind. A
national horror that terminated the presidency of Lyndon Johnson
and terminally embittered that of Richard Nixon is being recalled
to undermine Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephanopoulos has a point.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my own experience of 30 Augusts ago. Lyndon Johnson
had ended all deferments for graduate students. That included me. I
found myself looking at a 1-A draft classification and the cold
fact that nothing stood between me and the jungles of Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, I remember the relief of getting that letter
accepting me into the Peace Corps, promising ready assistance with
any problems I might be having with the draft.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the equal relief two years later on winning a lottery
number in the low 300s.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of men my age mentally can download the same list of
dates and reclassifications, deferments won and lost, draft numbers
high and low.
</P>
<P>
   Young George is right. None of us has forgotten any of it _
least of all a day your number came up.

four years ago, when Silicon Valley start-up Netscape
Communications Corp. launched its efforts to make the Internet
appealing to mainstream computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Netscape, its role in pioneering the development of
browser software used to surf the World Wide Web and the threat it
presented to Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer market is
chronicled in ``Speeding the Net: The Inside Story of Netscape and
How It Challenged Microsoft'' (Atlantic Monthly Press. $25, 323
pages.) Authors Joshua Quittner and Michelle Slatalla have written
four other technology business books, including ``Masters of
Deception: The Gang that Ruled Cyberspace.'' This time, they have
produced a compelling account of Netscape's early days and how it
ushered in a new era in personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is best known for developing the first commercial
software that simplified accessing Internet data. The company
initially comprised Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark and a team
of programmers who had helped develop an academic version of the
so-called browser software at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape had the commercial success in developing Internet
software. Previously, the Internet had been little more than a
network connecting academics and computer experts who knew the
arcane computer commands needed to send, receive and access remote
information.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape served up software that made it easy for mainstream
computer users to tap the wealth of information available on the
World Wide Web. Accessing information became as easy as pointing to
an on-screen text link and clicking on it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was simple, but it shook the computing world that
Microsoft ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the browser software could ultimately become the
single window that personal computer users needed to the outside
world, potentially ending the need for Microsoft's pre-eminent and
highly lucrative Windows operating system, used on more than 80
percent of all personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of any new technology represented a threat to
hegemony,'' Quittner and Slatalla write. ``The new battle for the
control over the software industry would be fought on the Net, not
on the desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the stakes for computer industry dominance rise through
the time line of this book, the story stumbles. The rich, thorough
storytelling that characterized the first two-thirds of the book
describing Netscape's formation and launch quickly devolves into
elongated explanations of the meaning behind news releases that
Netscape and its chief rival issued.
</P>
<P>
   What starts as a spellbinding, nearly first-person account of a
perilous start-up shifts in later chapters to a dry recounting of
the corporate warfare between Netscape and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Quittner and Slatalla still deliver a package that
offers significant perspectives to those trying to understand the
government's antitrust case against Microsoft.

   Using the Bible as a guide for business is a small trend
highlighted by companies such as Ohio-based manufacturer R.W.
Beckett. The president of that company, John Beckett, has been
vocal on the subject and has written a book on combining faith and
principles with business. He focuses strictly on applying Christian
principles to business practices, so don't expect other religions

LITTLE WAYS THAT ANGER CAN KILL YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware the hostile heart.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, I admit that I sometimes get impatient in the express
checkout line at my favorite grocery and count the items in the
cart of the customer ahead of me _ especially if two or three more
customers are in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And, I may get annoyed and huff and puff a little when I get
stuck in traffic; but I'm not cynical, much less hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not, says a researcher affiliated with Duke
University's Behavioral Medicine Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Redford Williams has been warning for years that cynicism is
part and parcel of a hostile personality and that a hostile
personality can kill us _ most often by heart disease but also by
injuries and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Williams has come up with a short self-test, published in
the August issue of Consumer Reports on Health, to help us
determine whether we are too hostile for our own good. He says if
we find five or more of these statements to be true, it's
definitely time to mellow out:
</P>
<P>
   _ I often get annoyed at checkout cashiers or the people in
front of me when I'm waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   _ I usually keep an eye on the people I work or live with to
make sure they do what they should.
</P>
<P>
   _ I often wonder how homeless people can have so little respect
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ I believe that most people will take advantage of you, if you
let them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The habits of friends or family members often annoy me.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I'm stuck in traffic, I often start breathing faster and
my heart pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ When I'm annoyed with people, I really want to let them know
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If someone does me wrong, I really want to get even.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'd like to have the last word in any argument.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least once a week, I have the urge to yell or even hit
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Most researchers believe that the more often we get angry, the
greater our risk of heart attack _ no matter how we handle that
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Anger can kill by speeding up the heart rate and making blood
pressure soar in such a way that deposits on coronary arteries are
disrupted or clots are formed. Anger can narrow the coronary
arteries just when the heart muscle needs extra blood, and even
inhibit certain nerve signals that help maintain normal heart
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   COX-2 LOOKING GOOD: Remember COX-2 inhibitors, the new class of
anti-inflammatory drugs under development for long-term treatment
of arthritis without the gastrointestinal side effects of the
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs we have now?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the drugs may also prove important to the
treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease, colon cancer,
kidney disease, osteoporosis and other major health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Top medical researchers reported promising studies on a broad
range of medical conditions at a recent international workshop on
COX-2, organized by Dr. Peter Lipsky, director of the Harold C.
Simmons Arthritis Research Center at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

SEEKING THE UNUSUAL IN THE MONOTONOUS WORLD OF TUXEDOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No two ways about it. Men look great in tuxedos.
The graphic white of a freshly laundered formal shirt frames the
face and sets off the slimming silhouette of the shapely,
satin-lapeled jacket.
</P>
<P>
   However: Have you ever seen a roomful of guys in tuxedos? Do
they remind you of one of those National Geographic photo spreads
of Antarctica?
</P>
<P>
   Sharam Sharei, proprietor of the six Barcelino stores in the San
Francisco area, calls it ``The Penguin Syndrome,'' all these guys
dressed identically with such subtle variations they look like
cookie-cutter figures. Very few men actually vary the look. Either
they like it, or ... they are afraid to be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men who wear tuxedos wear a white shirt, black bow tie
and a black tux. That is the standard,'' notes Sharei, explaining
that ``the tuxedo was first introduced to the United States in
Tuxedo Park in upstate New York. The first time it was worn was in
the fall of 1886 when one of the residents of ritzy Tuxedo Park
went to England and was the guest of Edward, the Prince of Wales.
He preferred to wear this new concept instead of tails, which was
the dominant formal wear of the time. He decided it was too formal
for his country estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The tuxedo was a modification of the formal white tie and tails.
``They went back probably to the 17th century,'' says clothier
Wilkes Bashford. ``They were always worn with a stiff white shirt.
And they were always black. Tuxedos, in essence, were the
relaxation of tails. The gentry in Tuxedo Park felt they weren't in
the city but these were very affluent, proper types who still
wanted to be formal even though they were in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus it has been with men.
</P>
<P>
   Man, it seems, is the only member of the animal kingdom who does
not outshine his mate.
</P>
<P>
   With other species, the male is the plumagerian. He struts or
growls, preens or howls, fluffing his ruff or mane or tail feathers
while the dowdy female sits on her nest and hides. Not so the
upright mammal called man. It's the woman who gets the finery these
days. And for black-tie, formal events, it can be fairly expensive
couture frills and flounces. The guy in the tux: He provides the
stark backdrop on which she gets to show off.
</P>
<P>
   Hey guys, it doesn't have to be that way. It's just getting a
guy into something different, while still appropriate and formal,
that is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many options in formal wear if you want to set
yourself apart from the rest of the penguins,'' suggests Sharei.
``The word is: Accessorize. You can do it with a beautiful
cummerbund set or with a woven-silk vest or with woven-silk formal
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, however, are usually not daring,'' he continues. ``In the
fashion business, we have a huge hurdle to get over this situation.
How do we get men to become more comfortable in things that are not
of their standard? Are they daring to try color? The bridge, then,
is accessories.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes, however, that the white dinner jacket isn't too big of
a first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be worn in the winter _ that is nothing new,'' Sharei
says. ``It prevailed in the '30s, '40s and '50s over the black
dinner jacket. Humphrey Bogart wore a white dinner jacket in
`Casablanca.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, men, Sharei concludes, ``are basically conservative. They
always look a little dull. When you go to the trouble to dress up
for the opera, you also want a bit of pizazz and show you're a
breed apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is: Men are very resistant to change. And they think
that if they break tradition and stand away from the Penguin Pack,
people will point a finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing a guy thinks about when you suggest something
a little different is: `It's only for real young guys,''' Bashford
says. And it is definitely the younger man who will play with the
tuxedo concept and vary the standard, perhaps not wanting to fogey
up so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get something new on a guy,'' Bashford says, ``and
he can see how good he looks in it, then maybe you can make a man
change his mind.''

`FOOLS' CAN BE COMMENDED FOR TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory Nava's ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' is an appropriate
film to end the Hollywood summer of '98. It's the final salvo of a
barrage of movies during the last three months _ from ``Bulworth''
to ``Snake Eyes'' _ that have genuinely tried to be something
different.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a biography of Frankie Lymon, an obscure,
one-hit-wonder of the early rock era who died a tragic, forgotten
figure at age 25, and is remembered today mostly for being a martyr
to the greed of white record producers of his era.
</P>
<P>
   But the film omits virtually all of cliche scenes of the rock
biopic, it can find nothing especially redeeming to relate about
Lymon (Larenz Tate) and it tells his story from three angles,
through the eyes of the three wronged women he managed to marry in
his short life.
</P>
<P>
   It opens in the late '80s, long after Lymon's overdose death, as
his big hit _ ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' _ has becomes a cover
hit for Diana Ross. A court has ruled that Lymon's estate is due a
small fortune in back royalties, and the three wives turn up to
claim it.
</P>
<P>
   The wives are Zola (Halle Berry), a singer with the Platters and
a one-time star herself; Elizabeth (Vivica A. Fox), an ex-con and
incorrigible shoplifter; and Emira (Lela Rochon), a highly educated
Southern school-teacher Lymon met while serving in the Army in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows the trial that is held to determine which is
the real Mrs. Frankie Lymon (none, for various reasons, seem to
have a clear claim) and the film flashes back and forth in time
through several rock eras, giving us a ``Rashomon''-like view of
its subject.
</P>
<P>
   As a biography, the movie isn't much. It's littered with
anachronisms, it vastly exaggerates Lymon's standing in the rock
pile of the late '50s, and is so cavalier about the truth of his
life that it manages to omit the fact that he was only 13 years old
(and looked even younger) when he hit it big with the title song!
</P>
<P>
   And the film's single moral point _ that Lymon, like many black
performers of the early rock era, was robbed by his white producer
_ becomes emotionally moot, since we are left with no doubt that he
would have shot those lost royalties right up his arm.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, director Nava _ whose last film was the
ultra-respectful and candy-coated musical biopic ``Selena'' _ is
almost too disrespectful and too ruthless in painting Lymon as a
baby-faced monster, and too intent on turning his wives into the
cast of ``Waiting to Exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film is an original piece of storytelling and it has
its own cheeky style and sensibility. The performance scenes _
mostly with actors lip- syncing the original recordings _ are
particularly dynamic, and capture some of the energy and excitement
of rock at its beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its morbid subject matter, ``Why Do Fools'' actually
works best as a bold farce: a wry comment on the fickle finger of
fame, the emptiness of celebrity, and the absurdity of all human
endeavor _ a point perfectly delivered in a closing shot of the
harlequin face of rock star, Little Richard, telling us that life
is a cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love. Directed by Gregory Nava. Written by
Tina Andrews. Cast: Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon, Larenz

DIRECTOR'S CUT OF `CABIRIA' WORTH SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phenomenon of re-releasing old movies with added footage _
the so-called ``director's cut'' _ is mostly a marketing gimmick,
and an overused one at that. Most films worthy enough to be
remembered simply do not benefit by reattaching scenes that were
cut as part of the normal editing process.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven minutes added to Federico Fellini's 1957
Oscar-winning masterpiece, ``The Nights of Cabiria,'' actually make
it a slightly better film. It's nothing monumental, but the
sequence helps fill out the heroine's character and it serves as
the natural link to the next sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The restored, slightly expanded and re-subtitled ``Cabiria'' had
its American debut at the last Seattle International Film Festival,
where a post-festival poll voted it the audience-favorite film.
</P>
<P>
   Fellini's story deals with a short period in the life of Cabiria
(Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife), a
streetwalker-with-a-heart-of-gold, who, as the film opens, is being
rescued from the Tiber after being robbed and nearly drowned by her
unappreciative pimp.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film follows her through a series of episodes _
a night with a movie star (Amedeo Nazzari), a pilgrimage to a
famous religious shrine, an evening as the subject of a hypnotist _
ending with a promising romance that seems to be her one big chance
for a decent life.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound like much on paper, but ``Cabiria'' is an
utterly magical movie that pulls us into its spell and sweeps us
along to a tragic but miraculously satisfying and optimistic
ending. Most critics now regard it as Fellini's best film, and cite
Masina's exquisitely vulnerable performance as one of the most
perfect in the 100-year history of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The added, seven-minute, ``the man with the sack'' sequence,
comes after the episode with the world-weary movie star, as
Cabiria, wandering alone at night near the via Appia Antica, meets
a man handing out food from a sack to the legions of poor that live
in the pits and caves around the old Roman quarries.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last scene written for the film (after Fellini had
met a real-life counterpart to the character), and it was excised
after the film's Cannes debut and the director's preview of the
film for a Roman Catholic cardinal, whose approval was necessary to
get an Italian censorship certificate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a mystery exactly why the cut was made. The
long-accepted story has been that the church was offended at the
insinuation it was not properly feeding the poor itself. Fellini
biographer John Baxter believes this story may have been the
invention of the film's producer, Dino de Laurentiis, who ``with or
without Fellini's collusion, shortened the film for purely
commercial reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the film definitely plays better with the
sequence than it does without it. It's the natural emotional
transition from the comic night of hiding in a movie star's
bathroom (because his girlfriend has unexpectedly returned) to the
sequence at the religious pilgrimage, in which Cabiria _ inspired
by the man with a sack _ asks the virgin to help her change her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this may be a minor point in the context of the
whole movie, and Cabiria's religious awakening is short-lived, to
say the least. But it's surprising to see just how those seven
minutes broaden our understanding of Cabiria and sweeten her
perspective. Fellini's original instinct was the right one. This is
one ``director's cut'' addition that makes a great film a little
bit greater.
</P>
<P>
   Nights of Cabiria (1957). Directed by Federico Fellini. Written
by Fellini, Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli. Cast: Giulietta
Masina, Francois Perier, Amedeo Nazzari, Franca Marzi. Rialto

 `54' CONTINUES THE '70s MYTH  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest Hollywood disco-nostalgia movie, ``54,'' makes a
trilogy of sorts with those other two recent film portrayals of the
late '70s as the century's high-point in happy decadence: ``Boogie
Nights'' and ``The Last Days of Disco.''
</P>
<P>
   All three films see the era more in terms of myth than reality,
all wildly exaggerate the hedonism of the time, all were made by
directors too young to have any real memory or personal knowledge
of the subject, and all communicate a distinct envy that the party
was missed.
</P>
<P>
   This one is the weakest of the three, partly because its basic
story has already been told by ``Last Days,'' partly because the
casting is lackluster, and partly because first-time
director-writer Mark Christopher just can't quite get a handle on
his milieu.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of Studio 54, the infamous Manhattan
night club, celebrity hangout and den-of-iniquity from the point of
view of a handsome, 19-year-old New Jersey lad named Shane (Ryan
Phillippe), who's desperate to escape his boring,
lower-middle-class existence and sees the disco as glamor
incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the crowd of celebrity gawkers one night, he catches
the eye of the disco's owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), who gives
him a job as bus boy, and, thus, entree into paradise. In no time,
he works his way up to bartender and resident stud: a position he
holds until the IRS makes its first raid on the place.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, the film sees the late '70s in terms of
visual spectacle, and outdoes them in portraying the era as a Roman
orgy of sexual excess and pharmaceutical indulgence, inexorably
working its way to that early '80s climax which would spoil the
party forever (but is curiously unmentioned in any of the films):
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   When the music is playing, ``54'' thumps along nicely. But when
the music stops, it bogs down in cliche and soap opera situations.
All the choices here seem wrong:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cast of Gen X exploitation stars _ Philippe, Salma Hyack
and Neve Campbell _ is uniformly dull.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher's script seems a pale rip-off of both ``Last
Days'' (without its humor) and 1979's ``Saturday Night Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   _ His direction is unimaginative throughout, and his ``big''
climactic scene _ the overdose of an 80-something granny on the
dance floor (so help me) _ rings embarrassingly false.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have a more than credible performance from
comedian Mike Myers as the ill-fated Rubell. Unrecognizable in
heavy facial makeup, he's just right as the Brooklyn geek turned
power-mad celebrity hustler. But his part is not much more than an
extended cameo: the script doesn't even try to get under the man's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   54. Directed and written by Mark Christopher. Cast: Ryan
Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Mike Myers, Neve Campbell, Sela Ward.
Miramax. 93 minutes. Rated R for sex and drug-taking scenes.

BLAZING PADDLES: INSIDE PASSAGE EXPEDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first day, they wore perfume and aftershave, eyeliner and
creased pants. The last day, they reeked of sweat and salt. Nails
had ridges of black. Hair was matted to heads.
</P>
<P>
   The first day, many questioned their physical abilities. The
last day, they felt strong and powerful, sea warriors capable of
propelling themselves long distances across water through sheer,
brute muscle power.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation took only six days, three guides, nine kayaks
and a stretch of uninhabited wilderness on British Columbia's
Inside Passage so breathtaking it seemed a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like a time warp _ you're taken back to Indian
times. It's all nature, left undisturbed,'' said Frank McKeown, a
recent retiree from Houston, Texas, and one of the novice kayakers
who signed up for a six-day camp-out with Northern Lights
Expeditions, a Bellingham, Wash.-based outfitter that advertises
``No experience necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll go from being a novice to feeling comfortable in a very
short amount of time,'' said the trip's lead guide, Jacki Kofoed.
</P>
<P>
   But that first day, some looked like they might be up a creek
without a paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties played beneath polite chitchat at a pretrip session in
Vancouver Island's Port McNeil, the departure point. The group was
13 strong _ or weak. Who knew? And how lucky a number was 13?
</P>
<P>
   Ages hovered around 45, with one 23-year-old and one high-energy
66-year-old marking the extremes. Home ports were Michigan,
Illinois, Texas, California, Washington. Only a few had previous
kayaking experience. ``We saw kayaks out back of the hotel and we
were, like, `These are really a lot smaller than the ones we saw in
the pictures,' '' said a California woman.
</P>
<P>
   Kofoed assured us those were the boats, that they were fast and
stable, and that only five boats had capsized in 15 years of
operation. But she warned that the hypothermia-inducing water is 48
degrees Fahrenheit _ ``It makes me see stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Kofoed had some suggestions. One was to leave watches on dry
land. ``This is one week of your life when you don't need to know
what time it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Time not only flew by, it flew away as the group began mastering
basic strokes over the next few days, camping in dome tents and
venturing out from tiny Compton Island on Whitefish Passage.
</P>
<P>
   The brightly colored kayaks, seven 21-foot doubles and two
17-foot singles made by Northwest Kayaks in Redmond, felt tippy the
first day. Novices working the rudders with foot pedals cut some
creative Z's across the silky water and paddles flailed above the
surface in tentative, unsynchronized strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Old muscles that yelled during the day screamed at night,
calling for ibuprofen. One camper wasn't sure she could make it.
But the learning curve, as Kofoed had predicted, was high. Soon
even the most cautious found their balance and their stroke. The
trick was not to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles toughened. Smiles broadened. Bonds formed. During an
evening gathering, the sky turned from peach to apricot, washing
faces in gold as paddlers told why they had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``To challenge myself,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see if I could do it,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of awe took over the increasingly raggedy group. Day
after day, they watched bald eagles swooping out of trees to
scatter gulls on a herring ball, or schools of porpoises and
Pacific white-sided dolphins splish-splashing across the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   An expedition to Village Island, inhabited for thousands of
years by the Kwagyulth tribe, revealed both anthropological and
biological wonders. Elegant totem poles lay decomposing where they
had fallen, and the dense beach midden yielded shards of old
crockery, weathered glass and an occasional trade bead. A talk
about ancient tribal ways was interrupted by a black bear crashing
up an apple tree, unperturbed by the two-legged invaders below.
</P>
<P>
   After two days, most of the kayakers had stopped glancing at the
browning spot where their watches had once been. Baths were
strictly saltwater, and hair began to take on Lyle Lovett
dimensions. Instead of an alarm clock, campers awoke to the sound
of eagles whistling, ravens squawking _ or guide Scott Wilson
singing, ``Can you imagine how much I love you-moo-moo-moo.''
</P>
<P>
   At sea, the guides had an unblinking eye to safety, constantly
clumping stray kayakers and monitoring two-way marine radios for
weather updates. On land, they had an eye to fun, devising goofy
beach games and whipping up sumptuous vegetarian meals _ sushi,
pasta, pumpkin pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, the novices were beginning to feel like able-bodied
kayakers. But the biggest challenge still awaited: crossing
Johnstone Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Gale-force winds can kick up quickly in this 270-fathom-deep
channel off Vancouver Island, turning a placid paddle into a
high-seas struggle. Wakes from the four-tiered cruise ships,
gillnetters and purse seiners add to the watery confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The crew headed out singing rowing chants _ ``Or-eee-o,'' after
a favorite snack _ and dug into foot-high chop with newfound
muscles. White caps slapping the boats' bows elicited yelps of
delight.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the same group of novices that set out just three
days ago?
</P>
<P>
   When the paddlers reached the other side, they knew they had
arrived _ in every sense of the word. But there were more surprises
in store. Immense surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The first killer whales appeared in the late afternoon, hugging
the rocks near the shore by camp, bull kelp rolling off their backs
as they cavorted. Susan Matthews burst into tears. ``I've seen
orcas in captivity, but they are so beautiful, so happy playing
here in the wild,'' she said. ``It will stay in my mind forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The second sighting was midchannel: a pod of 10 to 15 orcas.
Kayakers hopped in their boats, snapped on spray skirts and
super-paddled to the orca playground for a seal's-eye view of the
pod. The expedition group _ which over the week had turned into a
noisy, intimate rabble _ was suddenly silenced as a 6-foot dorsal
fin rose out of the sea directly in front of the flotilla. ``I had
goose bumps,'' said Gail Botwin, from Chicago. ``They're so much
bigger than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The last night was a little sad. Everyone had become friends,
playing baseball with driftwood bats, telling secrets under
red-streaked skies, watching one another grow dirtier and stronger.
But the sky was filling with stars, and greenish bands of light
began to reach up from the horizon: The Northern Lights were doing
a ghostly jig in a long finale on a starlit stage.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, a few night owls in camp paddled out into the thick
of night to see bioluminescence, explosions of light emitted by
tiny organisms in the water. Each dip of the paddle caused an
explosion of glitter, and fingers trailed in the water left a
string of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The last day, as on the first day, the kayakers took measure of
themselves. What a difference six days had made.
</P>
<P>
   The stench of success was all over them. ``This is the dirtiest
I've ever been in my life,'' said Marian Sta-Ana, a nurse from Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sta-Ana, who had given herself the trip as a 45th birthday
present, had never even camped before. ``A week ago, I was, like,
`What can I do? Can I really paddle a kayak?' '' she said, staring
across the whitecapped water she'd navigated the day before. ``But
after crossing Johnstone Strait, I knew I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sta-Ana smiled a slow, satisfied smile. ``I've learned about my
strengths on this trip,'' she said quietly.
</P>
<P>

ACTRESS' PERFORMANCE MAKES `WONDERLAND' WORTH SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reason to see ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' is for its lovely,
grave central performance by Hope Davis.
</P>
<P>
   This New York actress has done terrific work in the past in
films like ``The Daytrippers'' and ``The Myth Of Fingerprints,''
but as Erin Castleton, a Boston nurse looking for ``quietness
without loneliness'' after her activist boyfriend leaves her, she's
reflective and very nearly still, yet makes a big impression in her
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Erin is devastated. All her ex has left behind is his cat. He's
cited his ``eight reasons for going'' on a video tape, but she
can't even watch it because he's taken the VCR. Erin's mother,
played with rollicking ``joie de vivre'' by Holland Taylor, places
a personals ad in the paper for Erin because she's tired of seeing
her daughter mope around her apartment all the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a serio-comic montage, Erin suffers the humiliation of
sifting through the candidates who have replied to the ad. The
experience exasperates and horrifies her and she figures she'd
rather be alone than deal with such misery.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town, plumber-turned-diver Alan Monteiro
(Alan Gelfant) is whittling away at his marine biology thesis and
is supporting himself by working at the aquarium. He's
over-extended with the local bookie because he's trying to pay off
his dad's gambling debts so he's working overtime while living with
his brother. Erin and Alan just miss meeting each other in scene
after scene full of coincidence and fleeting possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Erin finds her real soulmate when she least expects
it, but the road is full of pitfalls and emotional craters. The
premise that two people pass by each other in fateful ways and
finally meet when they're ready for love isn't new to the movies.
Just recently, ``Til There Was You'' covered the same turf, but
``Next Stop, Wonderland'' is a lot more intriguing and
well-designed.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brad Anderson, who signed a 7-figure, multi-picture
deal with Miramax based upon the response at this year's Sundance
Film Festival, the movie is terrifically edited (by Anderson) and
is full of the incidental life signs that are significant and true.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis and Alan Gelfant _ are likeable, no-nonsense,
unfettered actors who keep the journey toward their fateful meeting
low-key and appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is all the supporting ``noise'' going on around
them. Anderson clutters his movie with too much peripheral
``stuff'' and against an actor like Davis, who we can't take out
eyes off anyway, it becomes a nuisance instead of an amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland. Directed by Brad Anderson. Written by
Anderson, Lyn Vaus. Cast: Hope Davis, Alan Gelfant, Holland Taylor.
Miramax Films. 97 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual themes.

   RUSSIA-ECONOMY_ MOSCOW _ Russia indefinitely suspended
exchange-trading of the free-falling ruble after its value slid
Thursday nearly 50 percent from where it stood two weeks ago. The
central bank essentially has left the currency's value to be
determined on the streets in a further sign that it has lost its
grip on the tattered banking and currency system. The ever-deeper
financial crisis comes amid a political vacuum as Prime
Minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin struggles to form a
government and rumors continue to swirl that President Boris
Yeltsin may resign. Meanwhile, some opposition parliament members
called for a return to Soviet-style price controls and state
ownership of banks and companies. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

region's currencies. Latin American stocks have plunged this week
as Russian losses pushed interest rates higher on concern that
currency devaluations would spread. Economists are hopeful though
that economic reforms in Latin America, such as privatization of
state-owned industries, will stave off long-term economic disaster.

   ISRAEL-BOMBING _ TEL AVIV _ A rush-hour bombing killed no one,
but injured 18, left impressions of nails imbedded in window panes
and brought back the spectre of terrorism to Israel, so often its
target. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``There's no
apparent connection between this bombing and other recent bombings
in South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania, except in showing that
terrorism must be fought worlwide.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

to the Republican bastion of South Carolina, the South is serving
up some of the most competitive Senate contests in the country in
the 1998 mid-term elections. The parties are vying for open seats
in Arkansas and Kentucky and struggling to defend incumbents in
North Carolina (Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth) and South Carolina

the Georgia primary could also make things interesting for Sen.

FOOLS-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Nearly 20 years ago, writer Tina
Andrews heard Diana Ross' remake of the Frankie Lymon hit ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love,'' remembered Lymon's tragic life and thought,
``Hmm ... Frankie's story could be a decent movie.'' Now, Andrews'
idea of a Lymon biopic is finally coming to a theater near you. By
Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SHORT-FILM (Los Angeles) _ This weekend's ``Summer Shorts at One
Colorado'' is an off-the-wall exhibition of shorts by up-and-coming
filmmakers. And it's literally off the wall because the outdoor
screenings are taking place on the side of a two-story building. By
Bob McCarthy.

54-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The people who made ``54'' surely didn't
intend for the movie to prove the old adage that disco sucks. But
they prove it nevertheless. 2 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
FOOLS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' features
some fine performances, but the movie never quite decides what it
wants to be. A biography? Courtroom drama? Manifesto on the ills of
addiction? So, it manages to be only interesting _ and never
particularly moving. 2{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
STRANGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``I Married a Strange Person,'' from
the drawing table and somewhat twisted psyche of illustrator Bill
Plympton, is wildly imaginative and enjoyably sick. 3 Stars). By
Bob Strauss. 
. 
GAINES-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Davis Gaines is the Mark McGwire of
musical theater, having played the ``Phanton'' more times (1,956)
than any other phantom, even Michael Crawford. The show returns to
L.A. Sunday through Nov. 1 at the Pantages Theatre, giving us a
chance to talk with this once-alienated youth wo identifies with
the man behind the mask. By Reed Johnson. 
. 
JAZZ-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Groove merchants Medeski Martin &AMP; Wood
have long been lumbered with the acid-jazz tag, an often dismissive
label for various forms of rhythm-based music. By Fred Shuster. 
 
 
 
 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ When you talk to him, Travis Meeks sounds
young. Which figures, since the leader of popular alt-rock group
Days of the New is just 19. The quartet's self-titled debut on
Outpost/Geffen has spent more than a year on the nation's pop
albums chart. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The doe-eyed Lauryn Hill was featured
performer on the Fugees' Grammy-winning smash, ``The Score,'' on
which she crooned the ubiquitous cover of Roberta Flack's ``Killing
Me Softly.'' Now comes her engaging and self-assured ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' one of the best releases of the year

head swivel by a foul-mouthed child, the tinkling sounds of Mike
Oldfield's ``Tubular Bells'' and a devil of a time. It must be
``The Exorcist.'' This week, Warner Bros. released a 25th

30-minute documentary on the making of the film, offering some
fascinating tidbits and a chance to reassess the blockbuster. By

WHO WAS FRANKIE LYMON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly 20 years ago, writer Tina Andrews heard
Diana Ross' remake of the Frankie Lymon hit ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love,'' remembered Lymon's tragic life and thought, ``Hmm ...
Frankie's story could be a decent movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, still thinking about writing a Lymon movie,
Andrews came across Michael Jackson moonwalking to the sounds of
``Billie Jean'' on TV. Immediately, she knew she had her Frankie.
``Michael is Frankie,'' she thought. ``Michael could make his story
into a great movie!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Andrews' idea of a Lymon biopic is finally coming to a
theater near you. It's called, obviously enough, ``Why Do Fools
Fall in Love,'' named after the singer's only Top 10 hit. Jackson,
of course, isn't the star; he never managed to squeeze the project
into his busy schedule of albums, touring and plastic surgery. And
the movie is no longer a strict biography, either. It's part
courtroom drama, part nostalgic romp, with a dash history thrown in
for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A biographical dramedy,'' Andrews says, laughing at her
attempts to characterize her own film.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a first for Rhino Films. Anyone who loves music knows
Rhino Records, who have been wildly successful with their hip,
campy and just plain delightful repackaging of classic rock, soul
and r&AMP;b music over the past 20 years. Now Rhino is moving into
movies, looking to make _ what else? _ films about musical legends
that baby boomers hold near and dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every actor wants to be a musician, and every musician wants
to be an actor,'' says Rhino Films president Stephen Nemeth.
``We're just trying to do a little bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has several projects in the works that would do just
that, including biographies of shadowy blues legend Robert Johnson,
punk revolutionary Johnny Rotten and western swing man Bob Wills
and his Texas Playboys. There are plans, too, for a Monkees movie
that would be shot with a tongue-in-cheek, modern sensibility and
a, gulp, sequel to ``The Valley of the Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter project reflects Rhino's desire to tap into pop
culture as well as music. Two such attempts this year _ Terry
Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo bible ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas'' and the unfortunately titled Tarantino
spoof ``Plump Fiction'' _ sank without a trace, illustrating the
riskiness of mining cult classics for feature-film profit.
</P>
<P>
   Music movies are no clambake, either, as demonstrated by the
failure of highly publicized films like ``The Doors,'' ``Great
Balls of Fire'' and ``Selena'' to deliver audiences beyond their
respective niche appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't going to keep Rhino or the major studios from
trying. Just don't hold your breath waiting for a slew of new
releases. Last year, there were two Janis Joplin biographies in the
works, one with rock singer Melissa Etheridge and another with
indie-film darling Lili Taylor. Both are currently mired in
development hell.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there are three companies _ including Rhino _ looking
to make a movie about soul singer Otis Redding. Nemeth thinks Rhino
has the best angle, taking a look at a week in Redding's life right
before he died in a plane crash. Never mind the angle, though.
Rhino has something more important _ the music rights to Redding's
entire catalog.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly a help to screenwriter Andrews and producer
Paul Hall when it came time to finally make ``Why Do Fools Fall in
Love.'' Andrews tinkered with her script for 15 years, but it was
only when Rhino gained control of the Roulette Records (Lymon's old
recording company) that things began to fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song, with Frankie's voice, is so much a part of his story
that it would be hard to do a movie without it,'' Hall says. ``You
just listen to that song _ and it's never really gone away _ and
you can see why Lymon made the splash that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lymon was only 13 years old when ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love''
hit the Billboard Top Ten in February 1956. The song's infectious
enthusiasm was matched by Lymon's energetic stage presence, which
included an ear-to-ear smile, winning charisma and a matchless
ability (for a male, at least) to execute splits.
</P>
<P>
   Lymon would have made a great cheerleading captain, and he
probably would have been better served by spending more time doing
such normal, adolescent things. A little more than a year after
``Fools'' hit, Lymon broke with his doo-wop group, the Teenagers,
over business differences, and it was all downhill from there. A
succession of wives and drug problems followed, and he died in
1968, at the age of 25, of a drug overdose, still looking for that
elusive magic he had with his first hit song.
</P>
<P>
   The film centers on the legal battles among Lymon's three wives
over royalties from his estate. Each wife was different _ one was a
glamorous singer with the Platters, another was a felon, the third
was a demure Southern school teacher _ and each saw a different
side of the singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make up a better story than that of Frankie Lymon,''
says producer Hall. ``It's like he lived three different lives in
the span of just 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And three different lives that nobody really knows about, since
Lymon isn't exactly a household name. Larenz Tate, who plays him in
the movie, had not heard of Lymon until reading the script. (Same
story for the actresses playing his three wives _ Halle Berry,
Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon.) For director Gregory Nava,
unfamiliarity isn't a plus or a minus. To paraphrase an old
campaign catch-phrase: It's the story, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because somebody's famous doesn't mean you can make a
movie about them,'' says Nava, who says he has been bombarded with
music movie offers since he made ``Selena'' last year. ``If that
was the case, we would have seen a dozen Elvis movies by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, since it would be somewhat difficult for
filmmakers to acquire the rights to Presley's music and aspects of
his image, not to mention securing the courage it would take to
essay the life of a pop-culture titan. But that doesn't mean the
King won't continue to be a presence on film. (Remember the Flying
from ``Honeymoon in Vegas''?)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a dozen scripts on my desk right now that have
`Elvis' in the title,'' says Rhino's Nemeth. ``At the moment, I'm
reading one about a guy who wins the ultimate Elvis impersonator
contest. That's the stuff that gets me _ the obsession with Elvis.
I'm more fascinated with that than with Elvis himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Nemeth continues, ``we've been working for the past
three years on a documentary about Bob Dylan impersonators. And
when one of them is asked why he chose to impersonate Dylan, he
says, `Well, I wanted to do Elvis. But the field was too crowded,
so I went to my next choice instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the man says, you've gotta serve somebody.

   The doe-eyed Hill was featured performer on the Fugees'
Grammy-winning smash, ``The Score,'' on which she crooned the
ubiquitous cover of Roberta Flack's ``Killing Me Softly.'' Now
comes her engaging and self-assured solo opus, one of the best
releases of the year and a must-hear for anyone curious about the
state of r&AMP;b in 1998. The album makes forays into hip-hop with cuts
like ``Doo Wop (That Thing),'' reggaefied grooves on album-opener
``Lost Ones'' and the gorgeous ``To Zion'' featuring Carlos
Santana. Warm and sensitive as a singer, Hill is a groundbreaker as
producer, too. 3{ Stars. &QL;

MAYOR'S AIDE IS A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY

 c.1998 San Francsico Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Esther Hwang may be most ogled scheduling
secretary in municipal history.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang _ a recent graduate of the University of California at
Berkeley and a former Miss Asian America _ runs Mayor Willie
Brown's bustling scheduling department, booking roughly two dozen
meetings and events a day, fending off stacks of invitations,
calibrating Brown's days and evenings down to driving and
``cushion'' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, my job is to take care of the mayor,'' Hwang, 23,
said. ``He's Super Mayor, but he's only human. I have to make sure
his schedule is realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco mayor is a notorious workaholic, but his
special assistant _ who earns $42,760 per year _ keeps her own
swift pace, guiding a sideline modeling career that's taking
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, who grew up in Los Angeles, recently became the
spokesmodel for a car dealership and a cable company. There are
other deals looming for car accessory work in Las Vegas, Nev., a
good thing because Hwang really likes cars.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid television show ``Inside Edition'' plans a profile
soon. And on Sept. 2, she'll participate in the Miss California USA
pageant. Last year, she placed fourth out of 77 in the competition,
particularly impressing the judges in the swimsuit portion.
</P>
<P>
   But Hwang's primary calling card is a Web site (www.esther.com)
featuring her in microscopic lingerie, swimwear and casual wear,
none of the photos retouched or airbrushed.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying text is a trifle tortuous: ``With her long
shiny black hair framing an unforgettable face with her mesmerizing
cat eyes, she is as always armed with a dangerously contagious
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Web crawlers aren't turning to Hwang's electronic page for the
merits of its prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go straight to lingerie, then swimsuits,'' Hwang said,
eyes rolling. ``This site was created not to make money, but to
promote myself as a model. I want people to take me seriously as a
professional model. If people are interested in booking me, the
information is on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet watchers, she's huge in Singapore, Korea and
Australia. The most ``hits'' come from California and New York, but
Hwang _ to her bewilderment _ also has a large fan base in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my staff people called to my attention that she had an
Internet (site) ... I said, what do you mean, what do you mean?''
said Brown, a bemused supporter of his assistant's extracurricular
job. ``I said print it out, let me take a look. It was a very
impressive portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, a professional model since she was 16, actually launched
her Web page two years ago, but the site received little attention
until it was described in a newspaper article in June.
</P>
<P>
   The floodgates opened. So many people scanned the site that it
overheated and crashed. Back in operation, it generated about
100,000 ``hits'' a day for nearly two weeks until leveling at about
50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang was deluged with e-mail and phone calls from police
officers, firemen, divorced men and radio talk-show hosts wanting
to put her on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned them down _ they just wanted to make me look like a
bimbo,'' she said. ``It was like the `Love Connection' in here.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy mailed her Beanie Babies. Another offered her $100 for a
nude photo. Some made crude passes, others offered lucrative sums
to publish porn ads on her site, all firmly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Catapulted into computerized fame, a stricken Hwang was caught
unprepared. The world instantaneously acquired, she says, a
mistaken impression of her. To outsiders, she says, she seemed not
like a purposeful young woman marketing herself for potential jobs,
but rather a blowsy Internet babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could put up a sign on the page saying `Don't ask for
nude photos, there aren't any,''' she said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Women contacted Hwang as well, accusing her of setting back the
feminist cause a full century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminists don't like me,'' she said. ``They said if I'm a Cal
grad, why am I out in my underwear? I think being a woman is just
as powerful as being a man. But women forget that the power is not
rooted in losing our femininity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people will laugh in my face, but I am a feminist to an
extent. ... I'm a realist, also. I understand how difficult it is
for a woman to get ahead in corporate America. If you are born with
a brain, it's a given that you use it to advantage. That's how I
feel about other assets you may have.''

`STRANGE PERSON' WALLOWS IN PERVERSE HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating:3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Before Beavis, pre-``South Park,'' there was Bill
Plympton. The erstwhile magazine illustrator, newspaper cartoonist
and MTV ad-maker has been a staple of the ``Sick and Twisted''
animation festival circuit for years.
</P>
<P>
   His disgusting shorts like ``25 Ways to Quit Smoking,'' and
surreal first feature ``The Tune,'' are hilarious, hand-drawn
horrors that he makes with a minimum of assistance from other
artists _ perhaps because the number of people who can get on
Plympton's demented wave length is pretty limited.
</P>
<P>
   His second animated feature (following two modest live-action
films) is ``I Married a Strange Person.'' Like all his work, it's
wildly imaginative and enjoyably sick, even while it mockingly
follows the musical adventure format that Disney and every other
commercial cartoonmaker sticks to like goo. But the last thing
Plympton's interested in is comforting commerciality _ ``Strange''
gleefully wallows in perverse, erotic humor and graphic,
butcher-block gore.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, though, this 74-minute film's edge dulls; its
kinks lose their cleverness and the physiologically detailed
violence becomes less outrageous with repetition.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's still a lot of creative energy in Plympton's
sophomoric, smart-aleck obsessiveness. He's a satirist, of course,
and the target here is the obvious but always deserving one of bad
mass media.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where TV is being taken over by the fascistic Smile
Corp., a young newlywed, Grant, is zapped mysteriously in the back
of the neck by a wayward satellite dish signal. This creates a
superpowered lobe that makes all of his fantasies become reality,
something his perplexed bride, Kerry, soon discovers adds alarming
and intriguing dimensions to their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   When the head of Smile Corp. gets wind of Grant's powers, he
sends his private army out to seize the magic lobe. Though
initially unable to cope with her husband's, um, unavoidable
peculiarities (she particularly dislikes being morphed into other
female forms during intimacy), Kerry must decide if she loves him
enough to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Then lots of people get dismembered. But along the way, Plympton
drops some wonderfully funny set pieces into the mayhem, like a
rebellion of anthropomorphic grasses against their human mower, or
a saying of grace that degenerates into an anti-government
diatribe.
</P>
<P>
   Plympton has a sketchy, chiseled drawing style and an
understandably jerky, limited animation technique _ how many cels
can one guy be expected to draw, after all? But this doesn't
prevent him from achieving eyeball-crossing perspective shifts and
an endless avalanche of surreal grotesquerie. Even the production
numbers, set to the deceptively old-timey songs of ``Tune''
composer Maureen McElheron, are inventively profane, music-vid
mini-masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the endless icky bug array and the fifth head
explodes and internal organs are juggled for the umpteenth time,
Plympton leaves you wearing an amused, if grossed-out grin.

DAVIS GAINES UNMASKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; As childhoods go, actor Davis Gaines had a
relatively happy one.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Orlando, Fla., ``right before Disney came along,''
there wasn't much culture or theater to speak of. But his parents
compensated by taking Gaines and his sisters to New York City to
see Broadway shows, where he ``caught the acting bug early.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gaines harbored an inescapable sense of being a loner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great family, great parents, great sisters,'' he says.
``I didn't suffer as a child. But I do remember feeling different,
that I didn't fit in, (and I) marched basically to a different
drummer in that I loved my theater stuff. I felt ugly, and I felt
different, and kids made fun of me. And I think that initial
feeling, that pain of not being accepted, was a core of my being
for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's gotten over his youthful alienation and says he's
now ``happier than I've ever been,'' Gaines will bring some of his
old emotional baggage with him to the Pantages Theatre this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fitting, because he'll be reprising one of the musical
theater's most angst-ridden roles, the title character in Sir
Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, (the Phantom) is a human being after all, he's not a
monster,'' Gaines emphasizes. ``He's really a human being with
human emotions. And I've tried to make him more human.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, he's succeeded. At last count, Gaines has played the
masked madman 1,956 times _ more than any other actor in the world.
Not even Michael Crawford can claim broader ownership of the role.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines logged most of those performances during ``Phantom's''
225-week initial run at L.A.'s Ahmanson Theatre, where it was seen
by 3.4 million people between May 1989 and August 1993. It returned
last fall for 17 weeks at the Pantages (with a different lead
actor), drawing another 300,000 people and grossing $16.3 million
in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   After Los Angeles, Gaines went on to open the San Francisco
production of ``Phantom'' before he transferred for 2{ years to
Broadway, where the high-tech operetta has been lodged at the
Majestic Theatre since January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Mark McGwire, chasing pro baseball's home-run record,
Gaines says he's concentrating more on putting his best effort
forward each night than on reaching the 2,000-performance mark _
which he should pass in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the number so much, but it's very rare that a show
runs long enough to build up that many performances,'' he says.
``As we speak, I'm looking at a wall here (in the offices of
Broadway L.A.) of posters of Carol Channing and Yul Brynner. That's
a perfect example of performers who were able to keep returning to
a role over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   What keeps him returning to ``Phantom,'' he says, is that it's
one of the rare musical theater roles with substance. There's ``a
constant push and pull,'' a ``yin and yang'' represented by the
character's sensitive, artistic side and his vengeful, malicious
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt for the phantom and I've felt that he was
basically a misunderstood character. He grew up with a deformity
from birth and lived in a cage and really thought of himself as a
freak of nature, and so he pretty much has this self-image problem
that he can't figure out, and it causes him to do some evil things
because he's backed into corners so many times. He doesn't have
very good social skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he last performed on stage here, Gaines has diversified
his own professional skills. He left ``Phantom'' to star in the
world premiere of Lloyd Webber's ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' and
although the show did poorly Gaines says he learned a lot from
working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't happen very often, where Hal Prince is on the
other end of the line offering you a job,'' he says, referring to
the legendary Broadway director.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Gaines has appeared on ``Chicago Hope'' and ``Veronica's
Closet,'' released his first CD, ``Against the Tide'' on the LAP
label _ short for ``Life After Phantom'' _ and recently starred as
Bobby in Boston's Huntington Theatre Company production of Stephen
Sondheim's ``Company.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has sung with a number of major symphony orchestras,
including the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra last season. This fall, he's
hoping to spend his time off from ``Phantom'' making a feature
film, about which he'll say little at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the bad guy of course. I always seem to be the bad guy.
Those are the most interesting parts, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the show after nearly two years has been ``an
almost totally fresh experience,'' says the actor, now happily
based in Los Angeles after years of living in a sunless New York
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed, he says, is his empathy for the world's
misfits, whether or not they wear opera cloaks and swing from
chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret any of my childhood growing up, because I think
it's made me more sensitive to other people's feelings. I think
it's made me more sensitive to the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to meet kids and their families after the show, and
there's always one kid who hangs back and isn't gregarious, and I
just go to that kid innately because I know what they're feeling,
because I was a shy kid, too.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For an off-the-wall exhibition, Old Pasadena is
definitely the place to head this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer Shorts at One Colorado,'' a new festival of short
films, starts tonight and runs through Sunday in the historic

<P>
   `SHANGAI' RETURNS: Fifty years after its original release, Orson
Welles' 1948 film noir classic ``The Lady of Shanghai'' is back in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Welles' own lady at the time, Rita Hayworth, co-stars with him
as an alluring woman of many secrets married to a rich, older man.
Welles plays a stranger who wanders into their lives. The climactic
shootout in a hall of mirrors is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   The making of this film is a story in itself. Welles needed cash
to finance a stage version of ``Around the World in 80 Days'' he
was directing, so he approached Columbia exec Harry Cohn with a
deal: Money now for a movie later. To bolster his offer, Welles
quickly threw out the name of a paperback an employee was reading.
Though the book turned out to be less than what he expected, Welles
finished the film on time and on budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lady From Shanghai'' opens tonight at Landmark's Cecchi
Gori Fine Arts Theatre, 8556 Wilshire Blvd. For program
information, call (310) 652-1330.

been lumbered with the acid-jazz tag, an often dismissive label for
various forms of rhythm-based music.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the postmodern organ trio went a step further into the
avant-garde by hooking up with turntable maestro DJ Logic for three
tracks on the group's new album, ``Combustication'' (Blue Note).
</P>
<P>
   Although the disc is dominated by cooking groove numbers that
grew out of studio jams, there are also eerie-sounding reflective
pieces, a Latin shuffle, instrumental forays and a Kerouacian
spoken-word performance by blind East Village jazz aficionado/arts
dealer Steve Cannon on the track ``Whatever Happened to Gus.''
</P>
<P>
   Medeski Martin &AMP; Wood (MMW) got its start in the early '90s as a
piano-led ensemble gigging regularly at New York's downtown
Knitting Factory. Eventually developing into an organ-based trio,
MMW released five albums on other labels before moving to the
prestigious Blue Note jazz imprint last year.
</P>
<P>
   The trio was chosen by guitarist John Scofield to back him on
his acclaimed recent effort, ``A Go Go'' (Verve).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach hasn't changed much,'' said MMW drummer Billy
Martin. ``We're not really a conceptual band. Basically, when we
start preparing for a record date, we'll rehearse a little bit, but
we don't really know how it's going to end up. We start with some
sketchy ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   DJ Logic (Jason Kibler) appears on the cuts ``Sugarcraft,''
``Start-Stop'' and ``Church of Logic,'' scratching biting rhythms
and ambient textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had an affinity for that sort of DJ hip-hop
thing,'' Martin explained. ``We always wanted to work with a DJ but
didn't think we could find someone who could improvise with us on
the spot. Not only does Logic have a great ear, he's just another
musician. He has his own distinctive voice on the turntables.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin says the key to the band's longevity is the chemistry
among the musicians. MMW also includes keyboardist John Medeski and
bassist Chris Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admire each other,'' Martin said. ``It's like a family.
We're here to play music, but we're also friends. All our
compositions are collaborations that we spontaneously develop on
the road or in the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin recalls the early years when audiences often were not
used to seeing vintage keyboards on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, people were amazed we were carrying this
Hammond B-3 up the stairs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many jazz-based outfits, MMW doesn't mind that its music
inspires movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get crowds moving, that's great,'' Martin said.
``People like to dance in this country, and that's what got us to
play grooves.''

IN `EXORCIST,' HORROR STILL STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Think vomited pea soup, a 360-degree head swivel
by a foul-mouthed child, the tinkling sounds of Mike Oldfield's
``Tubular Bells'' and a devil of a time.
</P>
<P>
   It must be ``The Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmark film, released Christmas Day 1973, upped the ante
in Hollywood when it came to shock value and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Warner Bros. released a 25th anniversary special
edition video ($19.98) that includes a 30-minute documentary on the
making of the film, offering some fascinating tidbits and a chance
to reassess the blockbuster. The $10 million film took in $82
million, a huge success at the time, and it received 10 Oscar
nominations (it won two _ screenplay and sound).
</P>
<P>
   In case you somehow missed it, ``The Exorcist'' is the story of
12-year-old Regan (Linda Blair), who begins to exhibit strange and
violent behavior. Unable to find a cause, doctors and psychiatrists
reluctantly suggest to her mother (Ellen Burstyn) that she seek
religious help. She enlists the aid of a skeptical young priest,
Father Karras (Jason Miller), who is having a crisis of faith.
After seeing Regan, who now must be tied down, he petitions the
church to perform an exorcism. The church agrees, and calls in an
older, more experienced priest, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), to
perform the ritual with Karras assisting. And even though it's a
25-year-old movie, we won't give the ending away.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does ``The Exorcist'' video stack up after all these
years?
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOCK VALUE: Despite numerous imitators (``The Omen,''
etc.), slasher films, alien gore and foul-mouthed kids since, ``The
Exorcist'' is still disconcerting. At one point in the movie,
Merrin warns Karras that the devil will use psychological and
emotional ploys to shake their faith. And that's exactly what still
works in the film. For instance, the language used by Regan (voiced
by Mercedes McCambridge as the Demon) is tame by today's standards,
but coming from the apple-cheeked Blair, it makes your skin crawl.
</P>
<P>
   THE EFFECTS AND STUNTS: What's most impressive about the effects
is how good they still look and the fact that they were done long
before computer-generated imaging. Oddly enough, one of the most
impressive effects in which Regan spider-walks on her back down a
flight of stairs was left out of the film because director William
Friedkin and screenwriter William Blatty, who wrote the novel,
couldn't figure out how to make it work dramatically. The scene is
shown in the documentary that precedes the film on the video. The
documentary also reveals how many of the effects and stunts were
done, so watch the film first.
</P>
<P>
   THE DOCUMENTARY: When it deals with the making of the film, it's
quite interesting, but there's a bit of silliness when they try to
imply that the set may have been cursed.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary also chronicles Friedkin's bizarre set behavior.
In one scene, Burstyn goes flying across the room after being hit
by the demonized Regan. To create the effect, they used a harnass
to yank her backward off her feet. After a number of takes, Burstyn
asked the director to take it a little easier, fearing that she
would be injured. Friedkin agreed, but when Burstyn walked away, he
told his assistant to really give it to her. The look you see on
her face in the film when she is slammed onto the floor is not
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin also had a penchant for shooting off guns unexpectedly
on the set to get the frightened reaction he wanted. Once, he fired
a shotgun next to Miller's head. Friedkin's escapades also are
chronicled in the book ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex,
Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood'' by former
Premiere senior editor Peter Biskind.
</P>
<P>
   THE FILM ITSELF: ``The Exorcist'' still maintains much of its
power, but a number of scenes are static or don't pay off. The
shock value of the film made it easy to overlook its problems.
Friedkin is much more comfortable with kinetic/action sequences
than exposition. In the documentary, Friedkin intones that this is
a ``film about the mystery of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Bill, it's a horror film that plays on people's faith for
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin and Blatty seem to have taken themselves far too
seriously. Blatty had a best seller, and Friedkin, in his early 30s
at the time, already had won an Academy Award as best director for
``The French Connection'' (1971), which featured a sublime
Oscar-winning performance from Gene Hackman and a stunning
car-chase sequence that still is unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Exorcist'' was his second smash hit. If anyone was cursed
by the film, it was Friedkin, who has had a spotty career since.
Nevertheless, his place in film history is assured. Both
``Connection'' and ``The Exorcist'' set new standards in Hollywood,
and both of them _ in their own way _ are classics.

DAYS OF THE NEW'S LEADER MEEKS SPEAKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When you talk to him, Travis Meeks sounds young.
</P>
<P>
   Which figures, since the leader of popular alt-rock group Days
of the New is just 19. The quartet's self-titled debut on
Outpost/Geffen has spent more than a year on the nation's pop
albums chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other musicians, they're not really into where I'm
going,'' Meeks said this week from Kansas. ``I'm just doing my own
thing, so I can relate to people on a spiritual level.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Days of the New hooked up in Louisville, Ky. The
album, featuring such radio-friendly tunes as ``Touch, Peel and
Stand'' and ``What's Left for Me?'' was cut in Nashville with
longtime R.E.M. producer Scott Litt.
</P>
<P>
   The group opens for Metallica tonight at Irvine Meadows
Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write songs so quick,'' Meeks said. ``I write on the road,
in hotels, at home. I can do it anywhere. I just get into a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks plays almost all the instruments on the nearly completed
Days of the New follow-up album, due in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little more work to do, some orchestrations,'' the
singer said. ``It's a very musical record. It might sell 2 million
or it might sell 200. It might sell nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years on the road, Meeks said he's learned a hard
lesson about the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fake, and it hurts me as a human being,'' he said.
``I can't stand it when people talk about me like they know me.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAME, THEY SAWED...: New Orleans rockers Better Than Ezra
got out the saws and hammers and simply built their own Fudge
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old garage off St. Charles Avenue,'' explains
singer-guitarist Kevin Griffin. ``A photographer was using it as
his studio. People say it reminds them of Studio B at Abbey Road in
London because it has 25-foot ceilings and the control room looks
down on the recording room. We put up a disco ball and all these
hand-embroidered gowns and stuff from Mardis Gras in the '70s to
muffle the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Than Ezra's just-issued ``How Does Your Garden Grow?''
(Elektra) was produced, engineered and mixed by Malcolm Burn, who
has twiddled the knobs for Patti Smith, U2 and Iggy Pop.
</P>
<P>
   The trio scored a top-40 hit in 1995 with ``Good,'' fueling
sales of their indie debut, ``Deluxe,'' which eventually reached
the 1-million mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternative radio is good, but when people see they can make
money, the playlists get tighter and it turns into another type of
hit radio,'' Griffin said. ``That's when you start having all these
one-hit wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN AT THE BAKERY: Jazz fans will want to note the return of
pianist Geri Allen to the Jazz Bakery in Culver City from Sept. 8
to 13. Allen's latest disc, ``The Gathering'' (Verve), has received
raves.

`FOOLS' STUMBLES IN THE TELLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During his brief life, one-hit-wonder Frankie
Lymon loved many women and even married three of them. But female
companionship could never take the place of the excitement Frankie
felt when he was on stage, performing bouncy ditties like ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love'' He never let his wives _ or anyone else _ know
him. Today, most people can sing along with ``Fools,'' but would be
hard-pressed to name its singer.
</P>
<P>
   When Lymon died _ and that's where this movie begins _ the three
Mrs. Lymons marched down to his record company's offices, demanding
the considerable proceeds from Diana Ross' hit remake of ``Fools.''
The women didn't want to split the money, and the case ended up
going to trial. And that's where we learn that not only were there
three Mrs. Lymons, but there were three, separate, distinct Frankie
Lymons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' features some fine performances,
particularly by Larenz Tate (``lovejones'') as Lymon and Vivica A.
Fox (``Independence Day'') playing Lymon's second wife, a
street-smart woman who suffered the most from the singer's failed
ambitions and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie never settles on a tone. Is it a biography?
Courtroom drama? ``Just Say No'' manifesto? Because it never locks
into a groove, the film manages to be only interesting _ and never
particularly moving _ in an A&AMP;E ``Biography'' sort of way. And even
then, the filmmakers are maddeningly haphazard with the information
they choose to include. We're never sure how old Frankie was when
he hit the charts (only 13), a fact we realize only when actual
footage of Lymon looking like little Michael Jackson is shown at
the movie's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Through the rather ridiculous courtroom sequences, we see the
three Lymons. First, there's the young, confident chart-topper who
toured with Little Richard (who makes an over-the-top appearance _
what other kind could he make? _ as a witness) and seduced
beautiful women like eventual Wife No. 1, Platters singer Zola
Taylor (a wonderfully glamorous Halle Berry).
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, Frankie was off the charts and spending most of
his time scoring drugs instead of hit singles. Zola goes on tour,
so Frankie hooks up with Wife No. 2, Elizabeth Waters (Fox), whom
he meets after she's caught shoplifting in a department store.
Fast-forward years later, and there's Wife No. 3, a demure
schoolteacher (Lela Rochon) who manages to domesticate Frankie for
a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The women spend a lot time degrading each other in the courtroom
(``Miss Thing'' is the epithet of choice), which gets old after
awhile. Another problem is the film's lack of insight into the
choices these people made. Director Gregory Nava (``Selena'') hits
all the high points and includes a couple of eye-popping period
concert sequences, but by the end of the film, you don't really
feel you know the characters any more than when it began two hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   You sure will be humming the song, though.

WHAT? `54' ISN'T SOMEONE'S IQ?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 2 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The people who made ``54'' surely didn't intend
for the movie to prove the old adage that disco sucks. But they
prove it nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Authentically vapid, this lightheaded gloss on life at the
notorious New York nightclub Studio 54 puts viewers into the
strobing, throbbing, mirror-balled action. You just don't get any
of the sex or drugs, and it soon becomes tediously obvious that the
most interesting things about the place were the sex and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardly poaching the plot line from ``Saturday Night Fever,''
writer-director Mark Christopher presents the whole decadent scene
through the eyes of 19-year-old Shane O'Shea (``I Know What You Did
Last Summer's'' Ryan Phillippe), a dumb, attractive Jersey City kid
who wants some glamorous fantasy in his working-class life.
</P>
<P>
   When Studio 54's lascivious manager Steve Rubell (Mike Myers)
spots sexy Shane among the throngs hoping to get past his velvet
rope, he lets him into the club. Once inside, Shane is dazzled:
People wear goofy costumes, people wear almost nothing at all, the
awful music is loud and insistent, Truman Capote _ whoever he is _
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Sure beats Jersey!
</P>
<P>
   Before Shane knows it, he's a bare-chested busboy on the fast
track to becoming the be-all and end-all: a shirtless bartender.
Women demand his services in the makeout balcony. Although Rubell
drools over him, too, the mush-mouthed boss is too busy filling
trash bags with skimmed cash and his nervous system with
pharmaceuticals to really act on his lechery (for some reason,
Studio 54 co-operator Ian Schrager is never so much as mentioned in
the film).
</P>
<P>
   Shane is befriended by a young married couple, fellow cleanup
crewman Greg (Breckin Meyer) and coat-check girl/aspiring diva
Anita (Salma Hayek). Besides providing the film with its only real
glamour in the form of Hayek, the duo play surrogates for Shane's
uncomprehending family across the Hudson who think he's gone, well,
54th Street on them (they're right).
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Shane also manages to get closer to his dream
girl Julie (Neve Campbell), a hometown girl and Studio regular
who's making it, sort of, as a soap actress. Why, even a
coke-snortin' granny (``The Wedding Singer's'' Ellen Dow) takes
Shane under her wing.
</P>
<P>
   Could life get any better? If you have no use for intelligent
conversation, perhaps not. But of course, no earthly paradise lasts
forever, and as the '80s loom, the price of excess, not to mention
the IRS, perform their standard duties and declare that the party's
over.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Stillman's ``The Last Days of Disco,'' which came out
earlier this year, wasn't a very good movie either. But at least it
understood that disco was a particularly empty pop culture movement
and constantly joshed its naive characters' certainty that they
were having the best possible time of their lives making the
superficial scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``54,'' on the other hand, only finds humor in some of Rubell's
arch behavior. Otherwise, it's an article of faith that everyone he
allows into his den of iniquity is there for a life-defining
experience _ like getting introduced to Andy Warhol (really, wasn't
everybody?) or dancing to the latest Village People single.
</P>
<P>
   For, um, depth, there's something resembling a class struggle
going on here. Rubell likes to make noise about construction
workers dancing the hustle with millionaires, celebrities and
royalty under his roof. But like everything else in this movie,
it's reduced to the most simple-minded expressions, such as snooty
Park Avenue twits making fun of Shane's cultural ignorance by
calling him a ``gorgeous troglodyte.'' No point, other than the
filmmakers' clueless condescension, is made by the follow-up
revelation that Shane doesn't know what a troglodyte is, either.
</P>
<P>
   But heck, what did any of that matter? The important thing about
Studio 54, at least to the makers of ``54,'' was that, for a
glorious couple of years between '60s idealism and '80s greed, a
select few of the beautiful and the damned had a great place where
they could ignore their cares and dance their brains out.
</P>
<P>
   Which, at least according to this film, should have been
illegal, since brains were apparently such a precious, limited
commodity at Studio 54.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For four months while she was a college student, Nadine
Duplessy bewildered everyone who passed her in the streets of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Her skin was the color of copper. Braids hung like soft rope
from her head. Yet when she opened her mouth, she spoke their
language with an uncanny traditional inflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really freaked people out,'' said Duplessy, who was born in
Haiti, came of age in Boston, and at age 20 found herself a walking
anomaly in the city of Chiba, Japan. ``Some people thought I
vaguely had something to do with reggae. Then I took the braids
out, and they thought I was Iranian. There's a large population of
Nigerians in Japan, and even they would come up to me like, `Where
are you from? Because you're not one of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   But where others saw only a question mark, Duplessy saw a
connection. She saw two islands _ one an Asian superpower, the
other an impoverished Caribbean nation _ that shared similar
cultural values, and could share the kind of economic ties that
might spur desperately needed economic recovery in her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that potential link has earned Duplessy, now 24, one of
the first prizes in a new scholarship founded this year by two New
York philanthropists. Established with a $50 million charitable
trust by Paul and Daisy Soros, the Soros Fellowships for New
Americans support graduate study for immigrants and children of
immigrants. Twenty fellows, all in their 20s, were chosen this
year; next year the pool of winners will expand to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to create a fellowship akin to the Rhodes and Fulbright
scholarships, an independent panel for the Soros program selected
fellows with an eye to finding future leaders who have overcome
obstacles to achieve excellence. Only two of the 20 winners spoke
English as a first language; six came to the United States as
political refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants have made great contributions to this country and
throughout the entire history of the United States,'' said Paul
Soros, himself a Hungarian-born immigrant who defected to the US
from the Hungarian Olympic ski team in 1948. Daisy Soros, who
serves on the fellowship's board, was born in Czechoslovakia. ``Our
purpose is to find people among today's immigrants who have the
potential to make such contributions, and to enable them to succeed
in their chosen fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 women and nine men chosen include a former New York
Chinatown gang member now in law school, a child of Indian
immigrants who invented a new prosthetic arm, and one of the last
Russian defectors from the Soviet Union, who escaped from the KGB
at age 17 during a US piano concert tour in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Duplessy, who graduated from Harvard College in 1996 with a
degree in East Asian Studies, is one of three Haitians who received
grants this year.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing her goal of promoting Japanese investment in the
Caribbean, &UR;  &LR; she has temporarily hung up her status as a walking
contradiction inside Japan's uniform society. Instead, she will
stay close to home, starting graduate school next week at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   There, she said, she will explore how to build economic
relationships from the many unseen cultural links that already
exist between the Caribbean and Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the connection defies intuition. Only 10
Haitians are known to live in Japan, according to Haitian
Ambassador to Japan Marcel Duret. But some ties do bind the
far-flung islands. Japan has its own embassy in Haiti, and in 1995,
the Japanese government sent two officials to Haiti as part of an
international corps of election observers. That same year, Japan
spent more than $6 million in humanitarian aid to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For her part, Duplessy instinctively felt the cultural
overlaps when she visited Japan _ from the common diet of rice and
fish to the rigid gender roles separating men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds strange, but being in Japan, there really wasn't
that much of a culture gap for me, and I could easily adapt,'' said
Duplessy, as she sat in a coffee shop near her alma mater in
Harvard Square. ``There is a certain way of talking to people who
are older than you, where you don't talk back to them. And the
kids, they study all the time and their parents really emphasize
that, which is how I grew up in Haiti. We were told that our
studies were our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started making those links, I thought, maybe there's a
way I can connect these two experiences and give something back to
my country,'' Duplessy said. ``I wasn't sure how, but I could see
the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Duplessy learned to create possibility out of
hardship. She left Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for the US in 1985 with
her parents and two sisters. She was 11 years old, and spoke no
English. The brutal, 29-year regime of the Duvalier family was
coming to a convulsive end, and her family hoped to escape a life
where her mother could not find work, and where sometimes Duplessy
found little more in her lunch bag than a peanut-butter sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   But while the world she left behind was one of struggle, it was
also one where she ruled the corridors of her school as a popular,
accomplished student. One where she found strong, silent heroes in
a house filled with aunts, grandmothers, and other female
relatives, many of whom worked.
</P>
<P>
   She was a middle child in an idyllic world _ too young to be
bothered with boys, old enough to build a universe of friends.
Suddenly, she was making secret preparations to flee, unable to
tell even her closest friends because of her family's fear that
others might grow jealous of their break for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point it seemed like all of us weren't going to be able
to leave together, and I volunteered to be the one to stay back,''
Duplessy said. ``The year before at our school we had had this big
carnival, and I was chosen as like a queen for this float, then got
sick and couldn't go. And I kept saying, `I have to be queen next
year! I have to!' But then we all ended up leaving at the same time
anyway. I was so bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of arriving in the United States, however,
bitterness soon gave way to new friends and new stability in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, where her aunt and uncle were
well-known in the city's Haitian community. After one year of
bilingual education and one year at the Woodrow Wilson School, she
was admitted at the Boston Latin School.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trajectory that fulfilled the dreams of her immigrant
parents, who had groomed her for medical school and a prestigious
career as a doctor _ still the most respected profession in their
native Haiti. But then, Duplessy got to Harvard, and something
happened: She took Japanese on a lark, and she loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did my roomates think? Crazy,'' she said of her new
obsession. ``I was the Haitian girl from Dorchester, and out of
nowhere I'm taking Japanese. I was walking around everywhere with
index cards with the English words on one side and the Japanese
characters on the other. It was out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   She quelled her parent's anxieties by promising she would go to
business school. But after leaving Harvard, she cut her own path,
studying Japanese business culture in Tokyo, and then teaching
others about what she had learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what kind of relationship can develop,'' Duplessy
said, aware that the path she has chosen to return home _ via Asia
_ may not be the most direct. ``It's something to work toward. But
if you can get people to listen to your ideas, they may start to
see something they never thought was there. So I'm just going to
keep doing it.''

SOME QUESTION LUSTER OF HEMINGWAY'S `LIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway wrote ``A Farewell to Arms'' and, with his
suicide in 1961, he wrote the farewell chapter to his own
larger-than-life life. What he failed to write, and may never have
wished to, was a definitive ending to his still-thriving publishing
career.
</P>
<P>
   With news that a Hemingway manuscript gathering dust at the John
F. Kennedy Library will be issued by Scribner's next summer as a
``new'' Hemingway novel, titled ``True at First Light'' and edited
by his 70-year-old middle son, Patrick Hemingway, some have
questioned the motives behind the project. Scribner's is said to
have paid $1 million for the rights.
</P>
<P>
   Is literary propriety being sacrificed to commercial interests?
some wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Or is any Hemingway _ bad or good, incandescent or
inconsequential _ better than no Hemingway at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another author who has enjoyed such a
posthumous publishing life,'' says Hemingway biographer Michael
Reynolds. ``And part of it was planned on his part. He knew some of
the things he'd written couldn't be published in his lifetime. This
was the 1940s and '50s, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press editor Robert Weil warns: Beware of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably people assume it must be a great work if it's by a
great author, and inevitably they're disappointed,'' says Weil.
``The fact is, most things that did not get published by a great
author when he was alive were not great works in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers get caught up in the hype, and then the critics
savage the book and readers express their disappointment. It
becomes a sorry affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Kaplan, a literary biographer who has written books on
Walt Whitman and Mark Twain, questions ``to what extent the author
is really the author'' when a heavily edited work appears 40 years
after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kaplan, ``You have to ask how much value you attach to an
author's motives. Assuming he has some sense of the shape and
wholeness of his reputation, do you risk diminishing it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light'' is a thinly fictionalized account of the
author's 1953 safari to Africa. It includes an account of an
interracial sexual episode that may or may not be true, but which
almost certainly would have caused rumblings in the more prudish
1950s. Scribner's will publish the book in July to coincide with
the centennial of Hemingway's birth. It is the fourth major
Hemingway book, all published by Scribner's, to appear in as many
decades, not counting various collections of the author's stories
and letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Movable Feast'' (1964), ``Islands in the Stream'' (1970),
and ``The Garden of Eden'' (1986) all sold six-figure totals in
hardcover and attained bestseller status, according to publisher
Charles Scribner. Of those three, only ``Eden'' was widely panned
by critics as being second-rate Hemingway. A British company is due
to film the novel next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most controversial posthumous Hemingway because it
was the most unfinished,'' Scribner concedes. With ``First Light,''
he asserts, pruning the 850-page manuscript Hemingway left to make
a 300-page novel did nothing to violate the spirit of the work as
Hemingway conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick mostly took out the redundancies,'' says Scribner.
``It was the kind of editing his father would have done if he were
still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy over posthumous publication by famous authors is
nothing new. Edith Wharton's ``The Buccaneers'' did not appear
until 1993, 56 years after she died. The manuscript was completed
by Boston researcher Marion Mainwaring, who wrote the last third of
the novel Wharton had left behind. The book was greeted with
splutters of protest by several prominent critics. John Updike
called it a ``bastardization'' in The New Yorker. New Republic
critic Andrew DelBanco dismissed the effort as an ``act of literary
necrophilia.''
</P>
<P>
   From Charles Dickens and Jane Austen to Ralph Ellison and Henry
Roth, plenty of high-profile authors have seen their work
unearthed, refitted with new material, and reissued from beyond the
grave. Even Margaret Mitchell was not immune to the publishing
industry's modern marketing forces. In 1991, Alexandra Ripley
published a dreadful ``sequel'' to ``Gone With the Wind''; and
three years ago Scribner's published a newly discovered Mitchell
short story whose literary merit was widely questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever faults lie in the Hemingway book, says Wendy Strothman,
editor in chief of Houghton Mifflin in Boston, ``It sure beats
having a sequel written by someone else. To me the question is,
where do you draw the line between serving the public and
exploiting a dead author's reputation? I don't know. The Hemingway
book sounds pretty interesting. I mean, you can turn your nose up
at it, but wouldn't you publish it if you had the chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa May Alcott is another long-gone literary icon who's
enjoyed a prosperous run in the hype-driven 1990s. Two previously
unpublished novels by Alcott have debuted recently: ``The
Inheritance,'' which was discovered by two professors doing
research in Harvard's Houghton Library and published in 1997, with
sales of more than 100,000 copies, and ``A Long Fatal Love Chase,''
edited by Alcott scholar Kent Bicknell and published in 1995.
Publication rights to the latter sold for a reported $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based literary agent Lane Zachary, who handled both
Alcott books, sees at least one parallel between ``Love Chase'' and
the forthcoming Hemingway book. It also dealt with mature subject
matter _ in Alcott's case, a stalking relationship _ deemed too
steamy for its era's sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Says Zachary, ``There was a lot of talk among scholars, Alcott's
heirs and myself, whether `Inheritance' should be published. It was
a first novel, after all, but a lovely one. There was nothing in
there that would embarrass Alcott, and we felt it would provide
insight into her development as a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, says Zachary, ``I don't think anything goes. I'm sure
there are pieces writers have written for nobody's eyes. We're
walking a fine line here, because publishing pressure is all about
the dollar. Ernest Hemingway's and Margaret Mitchell's names sell
books. Given that assumption, why waste the opportunity?''

CLINTON-LEWINSKY: SPARE US THE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a December 1997 New Yorker piece, Gore Vidal described a
story that he and investigative reporter Seymour Hersh had heard
about John Kennedy. It was a graphic tale of a bizarre sexual
practice that made the late president seem more satyr than
statesman.
</P>
<P>
   By now, we've been inundated by tales of JFK's bedtime exploits.
It's fruitless to even contemplate whether we had the right to know
about this _ and what would have happened if we did know _ while he
had his finger on the button. In terms of the private lives of
public people, that was light years ago. But even given the recent
torrent of JFK promiscuity stories (In the HBO movie, ``The Rat
Pack,'' he more than holds his own with Sinatra and his swinging
pals.), the disturbing Hersh/Vidal anecdote was beyond the pale.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the latest alleged ``news'' about Bill
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Only days after the president took to
the airwaves to grudgingly and obliquely acknowledge a sexual
relationship with the former intern, a story has begun inching its
way up the media food chain. It too, is a seamy tale of a sexual
act between Clinton and Lewinsky. And it is fraught with peril, not
only for journalism, but for our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike JFK's period of ``gatekeeper journalism'' when a few
powerful news outlets controlled the flow of information, we live
in an era of atomized news media and ``geyser journalism'' when
stories are propelled from beneath the surface up into the
mainstream media. (Thus, Gennifer Flowers's tryst with Clinton
migrated from the Star supermarket tabloid to ``Nightline'' and a
George Bush adultery rumor that began in The New York Post made it
onto the network nightly newscasts in one day.)
</P>
<P>
   Given the president's own admissions and Lewinsky's testimony,
it would be naive not to expect the many media references to the
nature of the sex acts between Lewinsky and Clinton. In one widely
quoted passage, this week's Newsweek magazine cited a source saying
that the details in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report will
make people ``want to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   But to date, the truly telltale details of the Clinton/Lewinsky
relationship have largely been the province of the media
netherworld and entertainment culture. Citing those ubiquitous
``multiple sources close to the case,'' cyber gossip Matt Drudge
gleefully announced the particulars on Aug. 22. Jay Leno, Howard
Stern, and various talk radio hosts picked it up. According to the
political Hotline newsletter, which is tracking such matters, the
matter has also made it into the London press, including the Daily
Telegraph, The Times, and The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   It briefly reared its ugly head when Republican pundit Mary
Matalin mentioned it on Sunday's ``Meet the Press'' program. (In
yesterday's Washington Post, Matalin said she inadvertently let the
remark slip, noting ``I don't think we need to know any of this.'')
Former Republican Congressman Robert Dornan alluded to it on the
Fox News Channel. And the story also surfaced in Tuesday's New York
Post, a newspaper that is often a conduit for unsavory information
that the mainstream media will not touch until it's first been
disinfected by the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   My fervent hope that this story spreads no further _ at least
until and unless it appears in Starr's report to Congress _ is not
based on a desire to give Clinton a pass. The fundamental nature of
his relationship with Lewinsky is irreversibly part of the public
record and his presidency probably hinges on the nation's reaction
to it. And for now, we'll ignore the unsubstantiated nature of
these prurient details and the mysterious sourcing.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is when in this voyeuristic media culture do
we finally say ``no mas?''
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point might be when we move from knowing that an
inappropriate sexual relationship took place to knowing exactly
what kind of relationship that was. We are long past the stage when
anyone in the news could expect to shield extracurricular
dalliances from the spotlight. But until now, the painstaking
details of how they got their jollies have never been anyone's
business.
</P>
<P>
   But as was the case with the JFK anecdote, the new Clinton story
threatens to demolish the last bastion of sanity and privacy in a
frighteningly invasive culture.
</P>
<P>
   There is never any turning back the clock when the media marches
over an old taboo. Should we deem it vital to know just how Clinton
and Lewinsky amused each other, it is fair to assume that future
public figures will have to submit to the same scrutiny of the most
intimate of human acts. Who knows? Someday even famous journalists
might be forced to reveal whether they'd ever slipped a dollar into
a G-string at a strip show or used whipped cream in the boudoir.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, this ugly story threatens to cross the thinly guarded
border between the tabloids and tattlers and our living rooms. Many
mainstream news outlets are said to be ``struggling'' with how to
report the details.
</P>
<P>
   For them, this would be a good time to heed the advice of one
former first lady and ``just say no.''

   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL;

   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL;

   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fans take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

IS CLINTON'S OOZE ZONE THINNING?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Here's a bulletin from a recent meeting of the American
Psychological Society in San Francisco, a story in a British
newspaper The Daily Telegraph headlined ``Men ooze happiness to
women.'' It seems researchers at the University of Chicago have
found that women are happier if they inhale ``an odorless substance
derived from the male hormone testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear from the story whether all men ooze happiness, or
only some of them, and whether they ooze it all the time, or only
intermittently. My own research, admittedly anecdotal, leads me to
think that male happiness oozing must be a sometime thing. I think,
obviously, of our president, who has oozed more than his share of
happiness in the past. Lately his oozone layer appears to have
thinned, on the home front especially, if we can believe all the
``informed'' analyses of the Clinton marriage that keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
   It's human nature to speculate, I suppose, but who really knows
what's going on there? Every marriage is different. Some have less
to do with sex, or sexual fidelity, than they do with sharing
experiences, goals, values, finances, and other elements and
personal quirks beyond our knowing or comprehending. It's difficult
enough to understand your own marriage, let alone anybody else's.
The Clintons' union is really none of our business, but everything
about the president's personal life is our business now, whether we
like it or not, or whether we feel torn. One part of me doesn't
like it a bit, another wants more details.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting interview with Maria Henson of the Charlotte
Observer, Ronald A. Heifetz, an authority on leadership who teaches
at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, suggests that
President Clinton could heal the country by admitting he's a sex
addict and getting some help. ``I think it would be extraordinarily
enlightening for the nation to see their president go to a 12-step
meeting each week,'' Heifetz said. ``I think it would be a great
move forward in giving permission to millions of Americans to face
up to their own problems that are still in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be extraordinarily enlightening, but it's difficult to
imagine. ``Hi, I'm Bill and I'm a sex addict.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the traditional 12 steps involves apologizing to everyone
you've ever hurt or offended in any way. Given the apparent scope
of his transgressions, this requirement could interfere with his
presidential duties, since he would have to make amends to everyone
who ever voted for him. As we've seen, apologizing isn't the
president's best trick. In that brief, angry speech, he couldn't
say he was sorry to the other woman, besides his wife and daughter,
who deserved an apology, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for Lewinsky, maybe because I remember all too
vividly what it was like to be young and stupid and nuts about a
married man. According to some reports, Lewinsky thought she and
the president had a future together. It's pathetic and all too
plausible. The poor foolish girl. She may be sexually sophisticated
but she is (or she was, at least) emotionally naive.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton marriage may defy analysis, but it's easy to imagine
the whole icky arrangement with Lewinsky. It's as old as time. ``My
wife and I have an understanding. ... We lead very separate lives.
... When you walked through that door I knew it was the real thing.
... You're the woman I should have married. ... No, I don't think
you're fat. ...'' He done her wrong. She has every right to throw a
hussy-fit, as a friend of mine put it. She meant to say
``hissy-fit,'' but her sub-conscious knew better. Usually it does.

<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard

wine are sold under her name.

PENSION FUND RECOUPS FROM MOVIE DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We just paid $3.24 to rent a couple of grade-B videos, ``My
Stepmother is an Alien'' and ``Troop Beverly Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we never feel cheated watching Kim Basinger as an
alien or anything else for that matter, and Shelley Long and her 47
outfits was funny enough as the ditzy Beverly Hills mom. Still,
four hours later we weren't so sure we got a bargain after all,
even at $3.24 for the double feature.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine then if you were the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The
state's pension fund paid $5 million a decade ago to buy into these
same two movies, and a handful of other bombs.
</P>
<P>
   You can thank state Treasurer Joe Malone, who oversees the
pension fund, and a group of securities lawyers, of all people, for
finally getting the dough back.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, seven years after the state's pension fund and other
investors filed suit, a jury in San Diego came back with a finding
that Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., the Wall Street investment banking house,
knowingly misrepresented critical facts in a junk bond financing it
put together in the late '80s for big-time Hollywood producer Jerry
Weintraub.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded the state pension fund about $6.5 million,
including interest, says Michelle Blauner, a partner in the Boston
firm of Shapiro Haber &AMP; Urmy, which represented the state. Two San
Diego investors were also awarded $500,000 each, and lawyers say
other investors who invested in the $83 million bond offering will
likely be included in the judgment, pushing the total award as high
as $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns' attorney, Peter H. Benzian, said Wednesday the
verdict is ``legally and factually in error,'' and said the
investment firm will pursue all available remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts's misadventure in movie making is a legacy of the
days when former Treasurer Bob Crane oversaw the state's pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1987 and Weintraub, whose credits included
``Nashville,'' ``Oh, God,'' ``Diner'' and a string of ``Karate
Kid'' movies, was raising money for his own independent production
company. Bear Stearns and Weintraub were barnstorming the country,
telling their story to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   When the roadshow pulled into Boston's Le Meridien in the dead
of winter, Paul Quirk, the pension fund's executive director was
there, along with Mary Lou Crane, Crane's oldest daughter and then
head of the state's film bureau. Harvard Management, Massachusetts
Financial and Colonial Management also came to hear Weintraub's
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone passed but the state pension fund. It
should have waited for the video like we did.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub Entertainment Group made five movies and distributed
two others from 1987 to 1990, when it filed for bankruptcy. Besides
``My Stepmother is an Alien'' and ``Troop Beverly Hills,'' there
were other box-office stinkers like ``Listen to Me'' and ``Fresh
Horses'' before Weintraub ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any standard, this was not a successful investment,'' says
Quirk, now a managing director of Triumph Capital, a Boston private
equity firm.
</P>
<P>
   The pension fund collected about $1.3 million in interest
payments before the production company collapsed, but eventually
wrote the investment down to zero, says Scott Henderson, who now
heads the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the state pension fund and other investors
charged they had been misled about Weintraub's financing
arrangements with its bank and its distributor, Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The investors said Bear Stearns had represented that the
distribution agreements would provide 70 percent of the movie
financing up front for the movies while in fact Columbia and the
bank had agreed to provide just 7 percent. Bear Stearns denied the
offering documents were misleading, but the jury sided with the
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub and two other executives had previously settled with
investors for about $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Malone has had a good run overseeing the $24
billion pension fund, something he has made a centerpiece of his
uphill campaign for the Republican nomination against Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he won a tough battle in the Legislature to
consolidate the state's two pension funds into one, saving millions
of dollars in cost. More importantly, investment performance has
turned up significantly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Malone took office, the pension funds were ranked
at or near the bottom in returns compared to their peers. Over the
last five years, the fund ranked in the top 8 percent of similar
funds, according to the Trust Universe Comparison Service, a rating
agency. The fund slipped to the 59th percentile over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Quirk calls the Weintraub debacle a painful lesson in investing
in the movie business. Our advice to readers: buy ``Troop Beverly
Hills,'' sell ``My Stepmother is an Alien.''

<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ After nearly a millennium of relative
obscurity, a medieval German nun has been born again into a state
of celebrity sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Entire industries have grown out of the renaissance in the
popularity of St. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess,
writer, composer and holistic healer who seems to turn up
practically everywhere this year, from Cologne to New York, exactly
900 years after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   In concert with a full year of international birthday
commemorations, some of St. Hildegard's two dozen pieces of choral
music, now on compact discs, top some music charts.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk Rhineland tourist trade thrives in her honor, with one
glossy brochure urging pilgrims to ``tour Hildegard's historical
sites by motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   A chic publishing boom has filled some European bookstores with
reissues of her imagistic poetry and mystical philosophy along with
shelves of cookbooks and calendars and an estimated 1,000 other new
titles that range from theological scholarship to mass-market
paperbacks like ``Hildegard in a Nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's followers of St. Hildegard cannot seem to get enough of
the ``prophetissa teutonica,'' as one early admirer called her in
1206.
</P>
<P>
   In what some call Hildegard health care, mainstream pharmacies
in German-speaking Europe carry several brands of herbal remedies
under her name that are meant to treat everything from heart
disease to migraines.
</P>
<P>
   One firm alone, Jura KG, claims to distribute its products in
10,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Fans munch St. Hildegard's whole-meal cakes, cookies and
dumplings made from the grainy dinkel flour that she recommended.
New Age adherents give symposiums on her advice(for using crystals.
Southern Germany boasts a Hildegard health spa.
</P>
<P>
   In a German election year, politicians have joined bishops in
holding speeches in St. Hildegard's honor. Ministers in Bonn have
issued a Hildegard postage stamp (often sold out) and commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   As a female founder of monasteries and a rebel in a
male-dominated church, she is also venerated by some women for her
distinctly feminist theology.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Bacchus also admire St. Hildegard, who wrote in one
of her medical texts, Causae et Curae _ or Causes and Cures _ that
``a wine that is pure cleanses the blood of its drinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Hildegard year, that advice has spawned Hildegard
wine-tasting seminars. At least three different brands of Rhine
wine are sold under her name.
</P>
<P>
   She even rocks. Angel Records in New York, a division of EMI
Records, produced an electronically synthesized version of her
canticles, or liturgical songs.
</P>
<P>
   After selling more than 300,000 and topping the Billboard list
for ``crossover'' productions _ a ranking of popularized classical
music _ Angel last year released a sequel called Vision II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Hildegard doing at the disco?'' asked one German
magazine incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Like other celebrities, she is frequently in the newspapers.
Culture commentators and religion writers have been scratching
their heads in wonder at the popular abbess.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is being revered, commercialized and exploited as never
before,'' according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   St. Hildegard was born in 1098, but because her exact date of
birth was not recorded, the entire year has been opened to a
windfall of commemorations. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 170 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of her feast day on Sept. 17, pilgrims arrive daily _
sometimes 20 busloads a day _ to visit St. Hildegard's Abbey in
Eibingen on the Rhine, one of two 12th century monasteries she
founded, said Sister Philippa, a nun at Eibingen. Many visitors
come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope will send an ambassador to the annual Eibingen
procession and mass on her feast day. Despite St. Hildegard's
powers of prophecy, which Pope Eugenius III confirmed as authentic
in 1148, it is unlikely she expected this sort of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was alive, she was not a pop icon by any means,''
said Benjamin Bagby, a co-founder of Sequentia, a Cologne-based
choral group that specializes in early music and has been credited
with St. Hildegard's revival.
</P>
<P>
   To rescue her from becoming a Benedictine Elvis _ as one
newspaper commented _ serious scholars and musicians like Bagby
have countered with hundreds of symposiums, lectures, concerts and
exhaustively researched museum exhibits. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the giddy sense of celebration is
apparently shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every Catholic college in the country is doing
something to honor her,'' said a Northwestern University professor,
Barbara Newman, who has translated St. Hildegard's poetry and ranks
as one of the leading U.S. experts on St. Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center has just performed her works to
sold-out audiences. Grace Cathedral in San Francisco is leading a
pilgrimage to Germany in time for her feast day, Sept. 17. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 120 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars come up with several reasons why the life and works of
a cloistered nun can loom so large across nine centuries. Perhaps
the most conspicuous stems from St. Hildegard's decision to situate
her convents in what is now some of the most heavily touristed
byways in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Eibingen monastery sits in the vineyards a few hundred
meters above the postcard town of Ruedesheim, trampled by 2.5
million tourists a year and often described as kitchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to drink and buy Rhine wine. It was only natural that
the local chamber of commerce created a ``1098-1998 Jubilee Year''
logo to promote a profusion of ``Experiencing Hildegard'' tour
packages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses also have driven her media resurrection. St.
Hildegard resonates powerfully in an era when publishing trade
groups report an unslackening demand for books and music with a
spiritual or religious theme.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of New Age enthusiasm, many Hildegard fajs take
from her what they want and do not bother to understand her in all
her complexity, said Gabriele Lautenschlaeger, a member of the
theological faculty at Wuerzburg University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits the slogan, `Jesus yes, church no,''' she said. &QL; 
St. Hildegard's life story also seems to fit Hollywood's dream
machine. At least two movie scripts are in the works about her,
said Paul Cremo, director of film and television projects in New
York at Sony Classical Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the monks in her first monastery, which she entered as
a hermit at the age of 8, her monastic life has been
well-documented. Revelations in the form of ``burning'' visions
overpowered the frail and often sick girl. She called herself a
``visio'' or mystical seer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the charismatic abbess came to resent the domination
of monks and was ready to found her own monastery, taking 20
sisters with her. The monks fought her, partly because her status
anchored their fund-raising income.
</P>
<P>
   The secession was the first of several feuds with a
male-dominated church hierarchy that she won.
</P>
<P>
   Today many of her fans discover her first through her music,
which variously has been described as ethereal, mesmerizing,
austere, complex and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in her hymns had been dormant for about 800 years but
has proliferated over the past decade onto some two dozen compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sites like www.Hildegard.com exist solely to sell her
music, which includes 77 canticles and a passion play that ranks as
Germany's first opera.
</P>
<P>
   Bagby at Sequentia said that publishers have a wide range of
interest in producing her music. ``Some just want to make money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry,'' Bagby said, ``saw they could make a lot
of money selling something very simple and very spiritual. People
who wanted to simplify their lives, like stressed-out business
people, buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Professor Newman put it, ``Even a watered-down Hildegard
has more to offer than much of our current pop culture.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: ... ``a monster.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The path that had once run between the grapevines and our
fruiting raspberries and blueberries was now a tunnel of wood.
</P>
<P>
   But before the summer was over, the Concord grapevines had leapt
to the challenge and it had become a tunnel of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Though any fruit had been sacrificed that first year with brutal
restorative pruning, in two months new growth reached the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year later, new grape canes have crossed the roof and are
starting down the other side, reminding us that we needed to prune
annually or face another ``cane mutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Grapevines fruit on second-year canes, I learned. That means
that all canes that have already fruited will never yield again and
should be thinned out, as with raspberries. Year-old canes should
also be cut back. If you don't do this, your grapevines will fruit
farther from the trunk each year, said White. You will also have a
tangled mess. (But lots of birds.) It helps to tie tape or strings
at the base of the year-old canes you preserve so you recognize
they're the first ones to lop off next winter.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I also realized we had actually built a grape
pergola, not an arbor. The difference seems to be primarily one of
length. An arbor is something a few feet wide you walk under or sit
under, part gateway, part nook.
</P>
<P>
   A pergola, on the other hand, is a long covered walk, often
connecting two buildings or looking out onto a courtyard. Pergola
derives from a Latin word for an extension of a building roof, but
today it is often used to describe free-standing landscape features
such as the one we built.
</P>
<P>
   My original idea had been to settle a patio set of table and
chairs under the structure. That might have been OK for an arbor,
but it looked all wrong for a pergola, which creates a feeling of
movement, the sense that it's taking you somewhere. Here, outdoor
dining furniture was just a visual obstruction. A narrow bench
along one side would be much better.
</P>
<P>
   Another belated discovery was how this tunnel of leaves focused
telescopically on the views at each end. The view at one end,
unfortunately, is a faucet and a large pile of rocks dug up over
the years from the garden. The view at the other end, well, there
isn't any until we create one.
</P>
<P>
   We have one of those gardens that has evolved without a master
plan. The guiding principle has been to preserve the farmscape we
inherited, the grapes, the apple orchard, the butternut allee, the
lilac hedges, and stone wall, and to have fun within those
rectilinear parameters. To me, that means no weeping cherries or
Japanese maples or kidney-shaped flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   But every change to the unplanned garden creates new visual
problems to solve, and now I must solve the problem of the
nonexistent pergola vistas.
</P>
<P>
   What would I do differently? More crossbeams on the roof would
be nice so I don't have to keep asking tall guests to push the
growing grapevines back up overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing we did right was to leave an opening onto the
garden in the middle of that long span to provide access and light
and tie it into the rest of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand dollars sounds like a lot of money to spend on a
garden structure. We've been talking for years about installing a
second bathroom, but it just doesn't happen. Instead the pergola
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The garden is a living thing, like a pet. If you own a dog, it
needs to be walked and taken to the vet. If you own grapevines,
they need something to climb on. If you're a gardener, the
stewardship of living things always takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   We are still learning to live with our new ``monster.'' We
haven't spent much time underneath it, as it turns out. Though it
is three-dimensional, it serves mostly as a leafy green wall that
provides a backdrop to the garden. It's more for looking at than
being under.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise is that thanks to the structure of the pergola,
we still have a garden in the winter. November light through the
rafters creates shifting shadows, and the garden no longer
disappears at season's end after the perennials are cut down.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the jumping-off point for creating more winter
interest, planting more evergreens and deciduous woody plants with
bark and berries that create an ambiance for our longest season.
</P>
<P>
   And the grapevines, well, they've unleashed a lot more
personality. Winter silhouettes of writhing trunks, spring leaflets
in a tapestry of red and green, summer shade, and now, as we move
into fall, the biggest, best surprise of all is becoming apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Large, heavy bunches of grapes are hanging down below the leafy
canopy. Thanks to gravity, they are no longer hidden by leaves, no
longer small and shaded. Instead they dangle like delightful
decorations, suggesting clusters of wisteria flowers in form as
well as color as they slowly change from green to rich purple.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE TO GET CONCORD GRAPEVINES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Russell of Westport Rivers Vineyard and Winery in Westport,
Mass. recommends using Concord grapes for decorative grape arbors
because unlike most other grapes they are resistant to molds and
mildews and don't require spraying. His family grows a more modern
seedless version of the Concord grape for eating. Two mail-order

   STRASBOURG _ There are of course great differences between
Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Kosovo, but there are also
similarities. In each case, ethnic or religious frictions have been
exploited and aggravated through a sadly familiar chain of events.
</P>
<P>
   When moderate political forces have failed to deliver, radicals
have gained ground, weapons have flowed in from sympathizers
abroad, attacks have been followed by revenge, and extremist
positions have further hardened.
</P>
<P>
   The way out of such evil spirals is arduous and complex, as we
know from both Dayton and Belfast. Substantial international
pressures and support are no less vital than an inclusive
constitutional framework for domestic peace-building.
</P>
<P>
   For far too long, the Belgrade authorities have rejected
international involvement in what they regard as their own internal
affair. This position is untenable for at least three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it reflects an antiquated notion of sovereignty. In the
Council of Europe _ to which Yugoslavia aspires to belong _ we are
deeply convinced that human rights issues are our common concern
and not the exclusive domain of any one state.
</P>
<P>
   This conviction, which underlies the European Convention of
Human Rights, is based not only on idealism but also on
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Europe, no country can feel safe with chauvinist and
authoritarian neighbors. That is why common values lie at the very
core of the new security system that Europeans are trying to build.
</P>
<P>
   Second, repression in Kosovo had a significant impact on other
European states long before the recent violence started. Several
hundred thousand Kosovars reside outside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Third, autarky is no realistic option for Belgrade. To find a
way out of Yugoslavia's poverty and self-isolation, its leaders
cannot merely pretend to accept fundamental standards. They must do
so also in practice.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Cold War, intra-national conflicts and
minority problems have surged onto the European political agenda as
the main threat to the continent's security. If identified in good
time, such dangers can be met with a panoply of civilian measures.
</P>
<P>
   The most important defense is to reinforce the basic instruments
of ``democratic security.'' Strengthening the rule of law,
promoting transparency and accountable governance at all levels and
building an independent judiciary are indispensable and
indissociable elements in that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But more specific measures are also required to satisfy the
legitimate needs of various minorities. With the mosaic of ethnic
and linguistic groups in Europe, few, if any, states are entirely
homogeneous. A country that cannot cope with this diversity and
integrate its citizens in a respectful manner may sooner or later
face disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vienna summit in 1993, the Council of Europe received a
mandate from its member states to address this problem. Two new
treaties have been developed: the European Charter on Regional and
Minority Languages and the Framework Convention on the Protection
of National Minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both go into effect this year, with the implementation to be
supervised by independent experts.
</P>
<P>
   But many states have yet to join these conventions. The issue is
a touchy one, sometimes affecting, or so it is felt, the
established conception of the country as a nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to combat xenophobia and distrust between
traditionally antagonistic peoples, and to strengthen cross-border
cooperation as well as local and regional democracy. An important
task is to make history education an eye-opener and not a
mind-closer.
</P>
<P>
   Many European states have resorted to constitutional engineering
to grant a special status to particular regions or minorities.
Several of the newly established democracies have been assisted by
the Council of Europe's Venice Commission on Democracy Through law,
a panel of constitutional law experts with advisory competence.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo struggle revolves around the issue of
self-government. For the Kosovo Albanians, restored autonomy is no
longer enough. For the Serbs, independence is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between these two seemingly irreconcilable positions
is not unbridgeable. Recent European experience, from Northern
Ireland to Moldova, shows that tailor-made solutions can be
painstakingly developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leaders may be about to crush the resistance on the
battlefield, but can they ever regain the cohesion of their
country?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond human casualties, the main losses of a war are mental and
moral. Restoring trust and respect for human rights must be the
cardinal aims of any strategy for recovery. &QL;

WE HAVE TO TALK 
Healing Dialogues Between Women and Men 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey &QL; 
Basic Books, 225 pp. $23 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You are washing the dinner dishes, and your wife is drying. She
asks you why you are silent. It is debatable (to you) that you are
being silent, but you concede the point and say that you don't
know. She says, ``Let's talk about it.'' At that point you: a) ask
her about her mother; b) talk with her about what you are feeling
and listen to what she may be feeling; c) excuse yourself to put
out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered b), you may not need to read this book. If you
tried a), reading this book could save your marriage. If you
answered c), you have to sit down, read it, and summarize the main
points to your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``We Have to Talk'' is simply a how-to book. The
authors, Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey, thoughtfully examine the
different relational styles of men and women and how they got that
way. They look at the inevitable disconnections that occur between
the sexes and argue that, with effort and creativity, those
differences can be used to move into deeper intimacy. Indeed,
working through the impasses to achieve and nurture connection,
they find, is both healing and the core of healthy relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Have to Talk'' builds on work done at the Stone Center at
Wellesley College, where Shem, a psychiatrist, and Surrey, a
clinical psychologist, are faculty members. The writers, who are
married, lecture together and for 12 years have led workshops, or
gender dialogues, around the country. Shem is also the author of
three novels, ``The House of God,'' ``Fine,'' and ``Mount Misery.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a crowded marketplace of books on this subject, and the
authors thus strive to claim new ground. The result is some
repackaging of the basic realities of a committed relationship _
e.g., that there is a ``we'' in addition to an ``I'' and a ``you''
_ in the latest discourse of feminist psychology. That discourse is
so much in the assumed foreground, that, for example, there are
almost no references to the women's movement, while the reaction to
it, the men's movement, is cuttingly analyzed and repeatedly
fingered for the blame. Older theories of self, the authors write,
represent a status quo that is ``hierarchical, violent, fragmented,
disconnected, and isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   I also have trouble with the stereotype of men. The men whose
voices we hear are, by and large, clueless dummies who would rather
``be in their caves,'' e.g., fixing things, changing the oil in
their trucks, or sitting in sullen silence rather than relating,
men who are puzzled and stung by the anger of their spouses. The
description of women's ways is more alert to stereotyping, on the
other hand. A half-dozen times, for example, women object to being
perceived as the ``experts'' at maintaining relationships.
</P>
<P>
   That gender jeremiad expressed, ``We Have to Talk'' is a useful
book. Shem and Surrey's jumping-off point is research done by Jean
Baker Miller and others at the Stone Center, and by Deborah Tannen
and Carol Gilligan, which found that women's psychological growth
is oriented not toward individual autonomy but toward human
connection, toward the building of mutual and growth-fostering
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Gender differences are hardly unknown, as John Gray showed with
the popular success of his 1994 bestseller, ``Men Are From Mars,
Women Are From Venus.'' But Shem and Surrey move in a new
direction. Rather than reifying these differences and inviting
people to exploit them to manipulate the other gender, the authors
propose ``holding'' them in a empathetic effort to understand the
other as a way to foster connection.
</P>
<P>
   The book identifies three obstacles that affect everything from
choosing a restaurant to having sex. They are: male relational
dread, which is contrasted with women's yearning for connection,
the male focus on product against the female focus on process, and
power over versus power with. Building on much current research,
they find that these inclinations are rooted in early development
of boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Shem and Surrey show their couples ways of stepping
back from these impasses, of hearing out the other not from the
defensive posture of self or gender identity but from the ``we.''
When they succeed in doing this, things begin to happen, and the
value of their approach, and this book, is clear. Shem and Surrey
describe it as a kind of yoga stretch: ``Every moment presents an
opportunity to stay in connection and grow, or disconnect and
retreat into old patterns of unresolved or avoided conflict. ...
(Doing so) is not easy, not always graceful, and not always
possible in any given moment. But staying with it eventually gives
birth to something new.''

   TAULIGNAN, France _ Yet another huge IMF-sponsored rescue
package has promptly fizzled out. Billions of dollars have been
spent to no avail. Disasters of this magnitude occur far too often
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Russian meltdown is a tale of bad economic and
political judgment, in the West and in the East.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing deeply wrong with the ruble. True, the fall in
oil prices has hurt Russia badly, and a moderate depreciation could
have helped. But the problem is elsewhere, and everybody knows it:
The federal government is increasingly unable to collect taxes,
which have fallen from 20 percent of GDP in 1992 to 8 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have managed to contain the budget deficit,
but they have done it the wrong way, by not paying what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Russia nobody feels that dues must be paid, not the
government and not the taxpayers. Why pay if there is no sanction?
</P>
<P>
   From headquarters just as lavish as those in New York or London,
Russian banks and corporations engage in big commercial deals, make
their top executives immensely rich, they claim that they cough up
a few kopecks and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   If tax collection goes on declining, there is no way the
government can service its debt. This is what triggered the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and foreign investors alike scrambled to the exit door.
Pundits certified that the ruble was not overvalued, but there were
no takers. Self-interested financiers convinced the authorities to
buy those rubles, and when the stock of dollars dried out in July,
the IMF provided a new pile which just went down the same tube.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the IMF conditions for the loan could have solved the
problem. But half of the required measures had to be approved by
the Communist-controlled Duma, which has never passed any
legislation without crippling it.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the other half, the government would have had to get
tough with bad taxpayers, but these are all the president's
friends, and the prime minister (now replaced) was patently weak.
The IMF conditions never had a fighting chance. That was mistake
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake No. 2 was not to request that the embattled ruble be
allowed to float. Same mistake as in Mexico, as in Asia, and soon
in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's main shareholder, the United States, committed mistake
No. 3. It decided that Boris Yeltsin's political fate was vital to
the U.S. national interest, and ordered the IMF to undertake yet
another expensive and predictably doomed rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here we are. Basic principles of economics have defeated
the might of top guns in Washington. Yeltsin and his friends have
sunk with the ruble, and the bottom has not been reached. What can
be done?
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the Russian authorities have suspended servicing their
debt. They had to pay enormous interest, which can only be
explained by the expectation of a forthcoming default.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who now complain about debt suspension are less than
candid. Even if they end up with half of what they were promised,
it will still turn out to be the best deal of the year, courtesy of
millions of impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities must also stop fixing the exchange rate. Their
stubborn defense of the ruble was really a guarantee offered to
Russian banks which had borrowed heavily in dollars. The price tag
is in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If banks fail, this will only be fair. Failed banks can be sold,
and there will be plenty of takers from the West if they are not
kept out by powerful lobbies and if the price is right. At last
Russia will have banks which resemble those that you find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the essential part: collection of taxes. Until
this is done, Russia will go on from crisis to crisis, gradually
imploding in the way Latin America did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way: Apply the law. But this requires cutting
the link between politics, business and finance. Yeltsin has shown
over and over again that he will not do that. He backed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on many tough decisions but he did not
let him touch big business.
</P>
<P>
   He has now brought back Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose main
political asset is immobilism. Too bad. Someone else will have to
do the job of establishing a market economy, one where either you
pay your dues or you go to jail. It's as simple as that. All the
rest is pie in the sky. &QL;

AT&AMP;T WARNS COMPANIES OF LONG-DISTANCE PHONE SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service client.s)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Think twice before transferring that call. It
could cost your company hundreds of dollars under a perennial phone
scam.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: outside callers target businesses that have
a public branch exchange, or PBX, which routes all calls made from
company phones through a central switch.
</P>
<P>
   The callers ask to be transferred to a phone line that isn't
part of the PBX system, usually an extension beginning with ``90.''
Dialing ``9'' gets the caller an outside phone line, and the zeros
hook him up to a long-distance operator, which then places the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the call is made from an outside line, the company
is still responsible for the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics aren't available on the amount of money companies
lose annually by helping con artists place long-distance calls.
Nevertheless, it's an ongoing scam in an industry rampant with
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Slamming, in which customers' long-distance carriers are
switched without consent, and cramming, in which phone bills are
filled with excess charges, are the most high-profile offenses
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of scams, and they're a dime-a-dozen,'' said
Kathi Oram, an AT&AMP;T Corp. spokeswoman in San Francisco. ``When we
shut one down, people think of something else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the PBX scam, the caller often poses as a phone company
technician, who says he needs to check or repair certain
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Oram said that although her company hasn't seen an increase in
this scam, talk about it swirled through the Internet earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, ``we were getting a rash of calls.''
</P>
<P>
   To quell inquiries, AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance
company, posted an explanation of the scam on its Web site during
the spring. AT&AMP;T also recommends:
</P>
<P>
   _ If a worker receives such a call, he or she should ask the
``technician'' for a call-back number or for the name and number of
the caller's supervisor. Then hang up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Company management should alert office staff and tell them not
to blindly transfer calls to unknown extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Oram said AT&AMP;T monitors its customers' phone bills and alerts
them to sudden spikes in long-distance, especially international,
calls.

</P>
<P>
   Investors who now complain about debt suspension are less than
candid. Even if they end up with half of what they were promised,
it will still turn out to be the best deal of the year, courtesy of
millions of impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities must also stop fixing the exchange rate. Their
stubborn defense of the ruble was really a guarantee offered to
Russian banks which had borrowed heavily in dollars. The price tag
is in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If banks fail, this will only be fair. Failed banks can be sold,
and there will be plenty of takers from the West if they are not
kept out by powerful lobbies and if the price is right. At last
Russia will have banks which resemble those that you find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes the essential part: collection of taxes. Until
this is done, Russia will go on from crisis to crisis, gradually
imploding in the way Latin America did in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way: Apply the law. But this requires cutting
the link between politics, business and finance. Yeltsin has shown
over and over again that he will not do that. He backed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on many tough decisions but he did not
let him touch big business.
</P>
<P>
   He has now brought back Viktor Chernomyrdin, whose main
political asset is immobilism. Too bad. Someone else will have to
do the job of establishing a market economy, one where either you
pay your dues or you go to jail. It's as simple as that. All the
rest is pie in the sky. &QL;

<P>
   Is Russia all right? Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed
Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, as prime minister in March, then replaced him
this week by reappointing his old ally Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that whenever Yeltsin makes a radical change in his
inner circle of government, his ratings tank.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's economic crisis worsened in March, Yeltsin chose
Kiriyenko, the young banker, as prime minister. But the president
was blamed for the devaluation of the ruble in the aftermath of
stock market price plunges, falling currency exchange rates and a
drop in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was brought back five months after being sacked.
Yeltsin probably could not find anyone else as reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But why was the government changed in the first place? It was no
surprise the Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament,
advocated Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiriyenko administration had just begun making progress with
collecting taxes _ the biggest challenge the Russian government
faces right now. But his impetuousness stirred discontent among
former colleagues in banking and business.
</P>
<P>
   He had to rely upon short-term government bonds and loans
arranged through the International Monetary Fund to cover the
budget deficit, but that could not be expected to permanently
resolve the fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis worsened, in part because of the government's
precarious position on the edge of default and coal miner strikes,
ruble devaluation was forced three days after Yeltsin had ruled it
out.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not only a devaluation of confidence in Yeltsin
but a loss of faith in all of Russian politics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no warm welcome for the ousted prime minister.
Chernomyrdin oversaw economic policy until a few months ago, and is
thus responsible for the present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His strong point, if indeed he has one, is his link to the
financial oligarchy, based on his former position as head of
Gazprom, the national gas utility monopoly, and association with
the opposition in Parliament and among local and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chernomyrdin stabilize Russia's politics by using such
assets?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's appointment of Chernomyrdin to be his political
successor reflects recent developments in Russia's politics and its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Russia's political realignment has begun in earnest in
anticipation of the parliamentary election next year and the
presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Chernomyrdin is leaning toward an alliance
with Aleksandr Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk. This is leading to a
three-way political race that involves the Lebed-Chernomyrdin
alliance, a group headed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and a third
group led by Communist Party chief Gennadi Zhuganov. Yeltsin must
back Chernomyrdin to save himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Russia needs political stability if it is to obtain an
urgently needed $22.6 billion (3.277 trillion yen) IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the opposition parties, especially the Communists, the
largest parliamentary opposition, have become ambiguous. Observers
of Russian politics suggest that the recommendation for Yeltsin's
resignation came because the Communist Party and Chernomyrdin's
supporters have become closer.
</P>
<P>
   Could such cooperation between Chernomyrdin and the Communists
result in greater emphasis on industrial policy?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin must clearly show where their new
regime is headed. If they become caught up in a power and money
struggle rather than wrestling with revival of the economy of
Russia, further sell-offs are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wormed his way out of previous repeated economic crises
by changing his aides. This time, he has even hinted at his
potential successor. If he resorts to the same method over and
over, however, he faces the growing problem of being held
accountable, both at home and abroad, for Russia's mess. &QL;

THE INTERIOR BONNARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French painter Pierre Bonnard thought nature was
a snare and delusion. ``What is beautiful in nature is not always
beautiful in painting,'' he wrote. Also: ``Nature sets traps for us
with her themes.'' He refused to paint from the motif, that is,
from a view or composition of objects either stumbled on or
contrived. He also disliked painting from a posed model. ``Live!''
he commanded an artist's model he'd hired, meaning she should move
freely around the studio as she might around a house.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnard himself was a reclusive man, living a very private life,
most content to be part of the wallpaper. &UR;  &LR; There's the story that
when contemplating his arrival in America he shaved off his
mustache so he wouldn't stand out. He was also the most intimate of
painters. In ``Bonnard,'' the wonderful retrospective at the Museum
of Modern Art through Oct. 13, there must be a dozen paintings of
nudes in bed, in the bedroom, in the bathroom, in the bathtub. The
nudes are mostly his wife, the reclusive Marthe; and Bonnard, also
nude, makes the occasional cameo appearance. This is life, not the
model. And there are scenes of French living at its most felt, at
the dining table.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at these largely empty tables you don't so much see the
food as know that it has lived its natural life and moved into
another sphere: More so than most artists Bonnard painted from
memory. If ``all food and flesh'' is one possible reaction to
Bonnard's subject matter, so is ``What's wrong with this picture?''
a reaction to his odd composition. Bonnard, dismissed by critics at
his death in 1947 in his 80th year for his ``agreeable'' canvases,
makes us uncomfortable the way he gets beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Eugene Frederic Bonnard was born near Paris in 1867, the
son of a civil servant in the French ministry of war. He attended
one of the famous lycees in Paris and might have become a lawyer.
His art training was entirely classical: a brief stretch at the
Ecole des Arts Decoratifs, where he complained he did little but
copy from antique sculpture; then the Academie Julien, where like
other students he painted in a coat and wing collar; and finally,
the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He did a little plein-air painting
outdoors. He did decorative panels, won a poster competition, and
exhibited at the Salon des Independents in 1891. The year before,
Maurice Denis had defined painting: ``We should remember that a
picture, before it is a battle horse or a naked woman or some sort
of narrative, is basically a flat surface covered with paints put
together in a certain order.'' How people saw was under discussion
by novelists such as Proust, poets such as Mallarme, and essayists
in La Revue Blanche, a journal founded by friends of Bonnard.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to his contemporaries Bonnard wrote very little. His
pocket diary with its daily descriptions of the weather _ ``beau''
when fine, ``nuageux, pluvis,'' when cloudy with rain _ sometimes
erupts with exasperated comment: ``Untruth is cutting out a piece
of nature and copying it.'' But when he talked about painting he
was lucky in the friends who recorded what he had to say. Or who
could describe him working. Bonnard, wrote George Besson, used ``an
indescribably blunt pencil that was so short that a landscape or
nude seemed to spring from the ends of his fingers compressed
around an invisible point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnard has also been fortunate in his two current curators and
their joint catalog. Sarah Whitfield organized the show seen at
London's Tate Gallery earlier this year and she provides the human
dimension along with much else. She goes beyond the Besson
description to see Bonnard's fingers traveling with the pencil,
``feeling their way across the surface of the paper.'' She adds,
``When painting, he sought a similar intimacy with the canvas,
which led to his unorthodox way of working.'' For his part, John
Elderfield, organizer of the show at MoMA, writes about ways of
seeing over the centuries. Most Bonnard canvases are very easy on
the eye but you'd also have to say they are also very strange.
What's that shape? A dog? More of the radiator? A cafe patron or a
chair? Most of us don't see as Bonnard saw; and he certainly had a
very poor opinion of how anyone but an artist looks at things. And
while we can enjoy a Bonnard canvas for its sheer color, for its
domestic scenes, its interiors and gardens, the lesson Bonnard
would want learned from his show is, we shouldn't take this for
anything more than painting. He liked the observation of his
friend, Stephane Mallarme, whose funeral he attended: ``Painting is
not the thing itself but the effect it produces.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Bonnard, the first thing that hits the eye is color. It
is colors remembered, and, he reasoned, why paint outdoors when he
could bring the effect of sun indoors by painting what a bowl of
oranges does to an interior. In one painting Marthe, a
bobbed-haired flapper in 1925, wears a jazzy striped cardigan that
lights up the whole dining room. In some of the bathroom scenes she
is nude except for mules in green or blue. The bathroom is a paint
box with big glowing tiles behind the tub and bright mosaics on the
floor. The tub is huge and white, a lozenge in shape, and light
glints off the metal pipes. In one picture, a little brown dog
stares evilly from the bath mat. That there's a nude in the tub
seems an afterthought. It's long-legged Marthe, with her jaunty
breasts and snub nose. Her skin is all the colors of fire opals.
This is Marthe-remembered, not Marthe-as-is. Bonnard painted her in
the tub dozens of times and curator Whitfield suggests bathing was
hydrotherapy for her weak chest. ``I have all my subjects to
hand,'' Bonnard once said. ``I go and look at them. I take notes.''
The evidence is all those sketches in his pocket diary. ``Then I go
home. And before I start painting I reflect, I dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It may help to know that Bonnard was tall. You sense he looked
down into a scene. He was also nearsighted. He did not use an easel
but pinned his canvases to the wall. So vigorously did he apply the
brush _ he liked Delacroix's comment ``one never paints violently
enough'' _ that the rough texture of the wall would show up through
the paint, rather as rubbing the face of a coin through tracing
paper produces an image. Bonnard's pictures are about what we see
without really analyzing it. We sense the big rim of the tub. We
infer lunch is over by the odd, empty spaces on the tablecloth. The
plates have been removed, and with them the geometry of the formal
meal, but the fruit bowl stays. The window is open. A garden flames
with color, but a garden that exactly fills the window like a
painted canvas shade.
</P>
<P>
   In dining room scenes Bonnard painted in the mid 1930s, the
casement window is shut and the vertical and horizontal of the
window frame just happen to intersect with the back of a dining
chair to suggest the wooden form of an easel. That would make the
vista a painting. In one version, in the view beyond the window,
clear-eyed curators see a river, and there is some cobalt that
could be a river. There's a centerpiece of fruit and (perhaps) one
table setting with cutlery marching out from the plate. The wine
this day is white, and it has been decanted into a tall-necked
carafe. On the right, along the very side of the picture, is a
figure. In the version shown here and called ``Large Dining Room
Overlooking the Garden'' (1934-5) the woman is Marthe and she's
placing a vase of flowers on the table. In another version, the
woman is Bonnard's white-haired grandmother and her form mimics the
scallop of the curtain fold on the left. The figure is painted the
same orangey red as the wallpaper except for a mottling of yellow
that stands for the blur of movement.
</P>
<P>
   During his student days Bonnard had fallen in with a group of
young painters who called themselves ``Nabis,'' Hebrew for
prophets. They moved freely and democratically between the
decorative arts and the fine arts, and Bonnard with them. They
liked tapestry, murals, painted panels, flat surfaces, shallow or
no prospective; and they admired Gauguin. From the way Cezanne
placed his bathers so naturally in a landscape of water, trees, and
rocks, Bonnard learned how to fit his nudes into a room so they
served almost architecturally ``like a post in the door or as a
door into a wall,'' Whitfield writes. This all comes together in
``Man and Woman'' (1900). It's a very formal picture, with strong
verticals and precise geometries, another of Bonnard's plaid
patterns. A folded green screen with metal hinges runs down the
center serving to zone Bonnard standing on the right from Marthe
sprawled on the left in bed. It is morning, and sunny, a ``beau''
for the pocket diary. Bonnard is dressing; he holds something long
and white, perhaps a shirt or discarded nightshirt, that curves
like his long thigh and leg. Marthe's outstretched hand, or perhaps
her toe, attracts two kittens, one a pouncing tiger and the other
fluffy white with a red bow. The sun gilds her skin. The room is
fat with strewn bed linens, the heavy French drapes and duvets, and
all this white makes an emptiness that both separates and embraces
the couple. Some commentators see the placement of Bonnard and
Marthe as Adam and Eve after the Fall, though Bonnard was not known
for religious subjects, but the hinged-diptych effect does
reinforce that. It's also perfectly possible to see the composition
as a conjugal snapshot, a morning like any other. Bonnard, who
seldom painted himself as a painter, seems to be dressing with
purpose, in a fury to be off. In the hands of other painters, the
distraction of the kittens would be sentimental. Here, they fill
the childless Marthe's morning. It is touching, funny, tender, and
harrowing.

<P>
   Is Russia all right? Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed
Sergei Kiriyenko, 36, as prime minister in March, then replaced him
this week by reappointing his old ally Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that whenever Yeltsin makes a radical change in his
inner circle of government, his ratings tank.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's economic crisis worsened in March, Yeltsin chose
Kiriyenko, the young banker, as prime minister. But the president
was blamed for the devaluation of the ruble in the aftermath of
stock market price plunges, falling currency exchange rates and a
drop in bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was brought back five months after being sacked.
Yeltsin probably could not find anyone else as reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But why was the government changed in the first place? It was no
surprise the Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament,
advocated Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiriyenko administration had just begun making progress with
collecting taxes _ the biggest challenge the Russian government
faces right now. But his impetuousness stirred discontent among
former colleagues in banking and business.
</P>
<P>
   He had to rely upon short-term government bonds and loans
arranged through the International Monetary Fund to cover the
budget deficit, but that could not be expected to permanently
resolve the fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis worsened, in part because of the government's
precarious position on the edge of default and coal miner strikes,
ruble devaluation was forced three days after Yeltsin had ruled it
out.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not only a devaluation of confidence in Yeltsin
but a loss of faith in all of Russian politics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no warm welcome for the ousted prime minister.
Chernomyrdin oversaw economic policy until a few months ago, and is
thus responsible for the present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His strong point, if indeed he has one, is his link to the
financial oligarchy, based on his former position as head of
Gazprom, the national gas utility monopoly, and association with
the opposition in Parliament and among local and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chernomyrdin stabilize Russia's politics by using such
assets?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's appointment of Chernomyrdin to be his political
successor reflects recent developments in Russia's politics and its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Russia's political realignment has begun in earnest in
anticipation of the parliamentary election next year and the
presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Chernomyrdin is leaning toward an alliance
with Aleksandr Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk. This is leading to a
three-way political race that involves the Lebed-Chernomyrdin
alliance, a group headed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and a third
group led by Communist Party chief Gennadi Zhuganov. Yeltsin must
back Chernomyrdin to save himself.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Russia needs political stability if it is to obtain an
urgently needed $22.6 billion (3.277 trillion yen) IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the opposition parties, especially the Communists, the
largest parliamentary opposition, have become ambiguous. Observers
of Russian politics suggest that the recommendation for Yeltsin's
resignation came because the Communist Party and Chernomyrdin's
supporters have become closer.
</P>
<P>
   Could such cooperation between Chernomyrdin and the Communists
result in greater emphasis on industrial policy?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin must clearly show where their new
regime is headed. If they become caught up in a power and money
struggle rather than wrestling with revival of the economy of
Russia, further sell-offs are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin wormed his way out of previous repeated economic crises
by changing his aides. This time, he has even hinted at his
potential successor. If he resorts to the same method over and
over, however, he faces the growing problem of being held
accountable, both at home and abroad, for Russia's mess. &QL;

EDWARDS READY FOR LIMITED ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Barring any unforeseen problems, Patriots
rookie running back Robert Edwards will take the field Saturday
night when the team faces the Philadelphia Eagles. Unfortunately
very little has gone as expected for the first-round draft pick
from the University of Georgia during his short time in the pro
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's pro career has been similar to his college career in
one aspect _ injuries. A nagging groin injury has limited him to
just a brief appearance in the first exhibition game, which means
it's still not known if he can fill the void created in the
offseason when Curtis Martin left for Bill Parcells's New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   And, Edwards's woes have only fueled detractors' claims that he
is injury-prone, and undoubtedly he won't shed that label unless he
goes through a stretch without getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have that label on me of not being durable,'' said
Edwards, who injured his groin at the end of the first week of
training camp, then aggravated it during the first exhibition
against San Francisco Aug. 2. This is the first week he has gone
through a complete practice since then, and Edwards said it reminds
him of his career at Georgia _ when he suffered ankle, leg, and
knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time at Georgia watching my teammates play.
But the good thing about this is that it's during the preseason,''
he said. ``Hopefully I can go out there and contribute to the team.
I went full speed (on Monday). I'm not sore or anything. I think
I'm close to 100 percent if not (100 percent).''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll said the team hastened Edwards's
return, which led to the aggravation of the injury. He said that's
not likely to happen Saturday. He will limit Edwards to 12-14
carries. ``We're trying to get him back into shape,'' Carroll said.
``We'll spot his play so we don't wear him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get him back out there. We thought he was OK. The
problem with new guys is that (when they are injured) you can't
decipher where they are. Robert really wanted to play. He had the
right attitude about it. He came back a little early, but now we
have waited and he should be in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he doesn't expect to have any problems with
completing his repetitions or catching passes out of the backfield.
He insists that one of his primary struggles will be shrugging off
questions about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why people label people like that. You have no
control over getting injured,'' he said. ``A person doesn't go out
and get hurt like that. It's God's will. There is only one way (to
get rid of the label), and that is not to get hurt. Any little
injury that I get, people go back to that label. But it doesn't
bother me. It's just a label. It doesn't hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards's absence has hampered a running game that is
arguably the biggest area of concern on the team. And it has
allowed other running backs a chance to earn playing time and show
some consistency. But Derrick Cullors is the only running back
averaging more than 3 yards a carry (4.1).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am a rookie and I have to build my character for
this league,'' said Edwards. ``It may be short, it may be long. Who
knows? I might jump right in this weekend and then next game and be
productive and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt his injuries have cost him in the competition
for the starting job, Edwards said, ``I don't think it has been a
competition in whether who is going to start or not. The
competition is we're working to make each other better.''

<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 was ostensibly a move to take
responsibility for the financial crisis the country faces.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the crisis is a legacy of Kiriyenko's
predecessor, Victor Chernomyrdin, who has been reappointed as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of manager decides to pull a pitcher off the field in
a huff, only to return him when his replacement was also battered
by hits?
</P>
<P>
   Making no clear explanations for his move, Yeltsin has only
succeeded in revealing the instability of his presidency, which has
less than two years left.
</P>
<P>
   The current financial crisis is rooted in Russia's decision in
1995, when Chernomyrdin was in charge, to switch from a policy of
extending government loans aimed at covering the large fiscal
deficit, to the issuance of high-interest short-term bonds. The
plan was endorsed by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the move was aimed at reducing inflation, the bonds
snowballed. By the end of this year, over $18 billion in bonds are
expected to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks that rushed to borrow huge amounts of U.S.
currency to invest in the bonds are now struggling to repay the
loans, resulting in the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, the Russian government also failed to deal
with the drop in industrial production, evident in the mining
industry, which saw a plunge in production in 1996 to 44 percent of
its 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
   It was also under Chernomyrdin that the government failed to
create a proper taxation system, despite the obvious need to
increase state income.
</P>
<P>
   When Kiriyenko was appointed five months ago, it was in the
expectation that he would deal with the aftermath of Chernomyrdin's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in the value of the ruble, in Russian loans and in
the country's stocks can be attributed to structural distortion in
the Russian economy, the retreat of capital from new markets _
triggered by the Asian currency crisis _ and falling oil and
natural gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some also point out the lack of political clout held by the
36-year-old prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared with Chernomyrdin's unclear policies, which
focused on encouraging a balance among the military-industrial
complex, energy companies and new business plutocracies,
Kiriyenko's stance was clear as daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko managed to get major portions of his economic
stability bill, which outlined measures to collect taxes and reduce
government spending, passed in the State Duma last month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kiriyenko attempted to break the strong ties
between the government and wealthy business plutocracies. He
focused on finding deputies who could get the job done, introducing
reformists such as Boris Nemtsov into his Cabinet and appointing
Communist Party member Yury Maslyukov as industry and trade
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic crisis has not resulted only from
mismanagement of the economy _ no, this crisis is on a different
plane. It is a result of a distorted structure that has seen no
increase in investments for productive activities.
</P>
<P>
   The reappointment of Chernomyrdin, who could be seen as the
cause of this problem, cannot possibly help solve the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When one considers that Chernomyrdin is a possible candidate for
presidency in the year 2000, a more radical but unpopular solution
to the situation would be difficult to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Yeltsin has dismissed deputies whenever his abilities
have come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Yeltsin merely wanted to fend off a political
crisis brewing over the ruble's devaluation one day earlier, which
could have precipitated a vote of non-confidence in the Duma?
Chernomyrdin is, after all, popular with the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest move will rescue Yeltsin _ and Russia _ in
the end remains to be seen. &QL;

DONN FENDLER RECALLS KATAHDIN ORDEAL 59 YEEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, Maine _ You might think a 60-year-old memory would have
faded by now.
</P>
<P>
   Donn Fendler is 72 and removed by an entire adult lifetime from
the events of that summer of 1939 _ a 30-year military career,
42-year marriage, four kids, six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But the adventure on Maine's Mount Katahdin, which made him one
of the most famous 12-year-olds of his day _ not to mention the
best-known Boy Scout _ just will not go away.
</P>
<P>
   His fans, found from grade school to senior citizen homes, won't
let it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why,'' said Fendler last Monday as he sipped iced
tea on the porch of his summer house on the shore of Lake
Sebastacook. ``Sometimes I wonder why there's so much made about a
dumb kid who got lost in the woods and then was lucky enough to get
found.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fendler's story has been touching generations of kids who
read his book, ``Lost on a Mountain in Maine'' and carry it with
them through their adult lives. It is read by entire school
populations, scout groups, and has become one of the classics of
outdoor lore.
</P>
<P>
   The story line is simple enough. In mid-July, 1939, hiking with
family and friends near the top of mile-high Katahdin in Baxter
State Park, blowing fog separated Fendler from his group. Within
just a few moments he was hopelessly lost.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, after most of the army of searchers who had
been scouring the area had given up hope, Fendler emerged from the
woods at a fishing cabin on the Penobscot River where he was taken
in and saved.
</P>
<P>
   As the search wore on, only his father, mother, and few others
kept up the hope that he was alive. Meanwhile, the story had been
playing with increasing urgency in all the papers and over national
radio by reporters such as Walter Winchell and Lowell Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   And to listeners across the country who hung on every progress
report, it was joyous news the morning of July 26 when they heard
that the ``little hero'' had been found _ 20 pounds lighter,
covered with insect bites, shoeless and pantless, missing part of a
toe _ but nonetheless alive and safe at last.
</P>
<P>
   As wonderful as the reunion was with his family and friends,
Fendler never had a clue how big the story was playing, or how big
it would remain to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, it was before the war, and I think things were
pretty quiet. There just wasn't much going on in the country, and
so my story caught people's attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being canoed home, his mother came out to greet him in
another canoe and the family's touching reunion on the Penobscot
River was widely reported. Back at the summer camp in Grindstone
Maine, life went pretty much back to normal after the round of news
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But then a few weeks later, he recalls, ``I got back home (Rye,
N.Y) and the barrage began.'' The press again swarmed him for
interviews, and his story was featured in Life, the biggest
national magazine of the day. Requests to come speak at Boy Scout
and church groups was so overhwelming that, ``I'd go and hide. I
just got sick of the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This round of publicity was capped off when Fendler was summoned
to the White House, where President Franklin Roosevelt presented
him with a medal to honor the young hero for his woodsmanship and
stamina _ ``the stuff of which the early pioneers were made.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all a little embarrassing to Fendler then, as it is
sometimes today. He remembers as an uncomfortable 13-year-old,
``the President took me onto his lap and told me about a time he
was lost in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   But from that day to this, 59 years after his ordeal on
Katahdin, Fendler's story has curious staying power. When the
state's public school system included his book in its unit on Maine
history, he was again besieged by schools, churches, and even
senior citizen groups to come lecture on his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Between June and October, when he summers in Newport with wife,
Bree, Fendler makes dozens of speaking appearances, and has to turn
away many more. ``I've had to turn down about 20 this year,'' he
says. ``It's just too much. I'd like to do them all, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   In his school appearances, he likes to spend at least two
minutes with every child, personalizing the visit, and getting out
a message a simple and straightforward as the story itself. Through
the long wilderness nights of incessant insect attacks, bear
visitations, and hallucinations, three things sustained him, says
Fendler: ``Boy Scout training, thoughts of my family, and the power
of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Hunt Trail, a popular five-mile hike to the summit of
Katahdin, is largely unchanged in the six decades since Fendler,
his father, two brothers and two friends, made their ascent. Then,
as now, a summer day at the base of the mountain can turn cold and
hostile 5,000 feet higher out on the exposed, wind-scoured granite
above the timberline.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, in the opening chapter of ``Lost on a Mountain in
Maine,'' ghost-written by Joseph Egan, Fendler recounts: ``The top
of Katahdin was just ahead. We could see it through a break in the
cold, misty clouds that whirled about us ... Those last hundred
yards were heavy ones and, in spite of the stiff, rocky climb, I
was cold and shivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``with all that big cloud-covered mountain below us and
clouds rolling like smoke around us'' Fendler took off ahead of his
companion at the peak, down to find his father lower on the trail.
Within a dozen yards, as ``an extra heavy cloud rolled in around
us,'' the 12-year-old was separated from his party, and within
minutes was hopelessly lost amid the huge glacial boulders, and
with knowledge that in one direction lay a 500-foot cliff. The
deprivation that was to mark the next nine days of his life began
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling I was right on the edge of a great cliff.
The way the clouds swirled scared me. The rocks about me looked
more like ghosts than rocks, until I tried to climb over them.
Besides, sleet was beginning to fall. It formed slick, thin ice on
the sleeves of my reefer (jacket) and I had to wipe it off my face
... I was wearing a pair of blue dungarees and I could feel the
water seeping through and getting cold about my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than returning down along the Hunt Trail, Fendler has
split off to the right on Saddle Trail, a dangerous passage in bad
weather because of its exposure. Along this stretch, a desolate
wasteland of loose sharp rocks, Fendler's sneakers got so badly cut
up they were useless, and he had to spend the rest of his ordeal
barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   He knew, according to Boy Scout training and his father's
guidance, that lost hikers should find a stream. ``Follow a stream
down. It will lead to a larger stream, and there are always camps
along the larger stream.''
</P>
<P>
   In Fendler's case, though, the stream he followed flowed north,
into the interior wilderness of the park behind Kathadin. Although
many searchers were convinced that the boy was lost on Katahdin,
and perhaps had perished by falling into one of its many 30-foot
crevasses, he was actually lost in the forest surrounding the
mountain. Thus, even with bloodhounds, he believes the search
parties never came to within 10 miles of him.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, with so many streams coursing down the montain,
Fendler could not find the exact one he followed, and in fact could
never retrace his route before he reached the East Branch of the
Penobscot River.
</P>
<P>
   One time back with his wife, Fendler recalls he got lost again
looking for signs of his boyhood experience on Katahdin. He found a
ranger and told him where he wanted to go. ``The ranger said, `Oh,
you're the boy who got lost up there, aren't you? And you're still
lost.'''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing high school, Fendler joined the infantry during
World War II, and saw action in the Pacific. He then began college
at University of Maine, joined ROTC and became an officer in the
Special Forces (Green Berets) for the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fender fears that romanticizing the event beyond the facts can
diminish the stark and simple realism of the tale. So he avoids
trying to find parallels between the Katahdin story and his later
military life. ``No, I just became what I became,'' he says, ``but
there are three ways the experience did affect my life, and I
always tell the kids this: First, it increased my faith in God and
prayer. Two, I began to understand what responsibility for my
actions was all about, and third a greater appreciation for my
family. I tell the kids I even learned to appreciate my sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Fendler does not charge for his speaking appearances, and the
profits from his book _ which has sold in the hundreds of thousands
over the years _ go to charity. Before returning to his winter home
in Tennessee, he will have visited dozens of schools in the state.
``It's a great way to meet people and the kides. I just love it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is looking forward to a visit on Cliff Island off Portland
where the entire school enrollment is seven students. The more
chance, he says, to visit with each one individually. He also hand
writes responses to the hundreds of letters he receives, sometimes
in bundles from schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could send out form letters,'' he says, ``because I
know all the questions they're going to ask. But I figure that if
they can take he time to write, I can take the time to write
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, after almost six decades, Donn Fendler's adventure
story, complete with moose, bears, Indian ghosts and
hallucinations, the chipmunk that became his constant companion,
the bloodsuckers in the stream that attached to him and the
constant torment of mosquitoes and black flies, and final
deliverance in the log cabin across the river with the two canoes
out front _ it all remains Fendler's gift to a state he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, Maine did so much for me, I don't want to sound
corny, but it's nice to give something back.''

<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 was ostensibly a move to take
responsibility for the financial crisis the country faces.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, the crisis is a legacy of Kiriyenko's
predecessor, Victor Chernomyrdin, who has been reappointed as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of manager decides to pull a pitcher off the field in
a huff, only to return him when his replacement was also battered
by hits?
</P>
<P>
   Making no clear explanations for his move, Yeltsin has only
succeeded in revealing the instability of his presidency, which has
less than two years left.
</P>
<P>
   The current financial crisis is rooted in Russia's decision in
1995, when Chernomyrdin was in charge, to switch from a policy of
extending government loans aimed at covering the large fiscal
deficit, to the issuance of high-interest short-term bonds. The
plan was endorsed by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the move was aimed at reducing inflation, the bonds
snowballed. By the end of this year, over $18 billion in bonds are
expected to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks that rushed to borrow huge amounts of U.S.
currency to invest in the bonds are now struggling to repay the
loans, resulting in the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, the Russian government also failed to deal
with the drop in industrial production, evident in the mining
industry, which saw a plunge in production in 1996 to 44 percent of
its 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
   It was also under Chernomyrdin that the government failed to
create a proper taxation system, despite the obvious need to
increase state income.
</P>
<P>
   When Kiriyenko was appointed five months ago, it was in the
expectation that he would deal with the aftermath of Chernomyrdin's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge in the value of the ruble, in Russian loans and in
the country's stocks can be attributed to structural distortion in
the Russian economy, the retreat of capital from new markets _
triggered by the Asian currency crisis _ and falling oil and
natural gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some also point out the lack of political clout held by the
36-year-old prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared with Chernomyrdin's unclear policies, which
focused on encouraging a balance among the military-industrial
complex, energy companies and new business plutocracies,
Kiriyenko's stance was clear as daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko managed to get major portions of his economic
stability bill, which outlined measures to collect taxes and reduce
government spending, passed in the State Duma last month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kiriyenko attempted to break the strong ties
between the government and wealthy business plutocracies. He
focused on finding deputies who could get the job done, introducing
reformists such as Boris Nemtsov into his Cabinet and appointing
Communist Party member Yury Maslyukov as industry and trade
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic crisis has not resulted only from
mismanagement of the economy _ no, this crisis is on a different
plane. It is a result of a distorted structure that has seen no
increase in investments for productive activities.
</P>
<P>
   The reappointment of Chernomyrdin, who could be seen as the
cause of this problem, cannot possibly help solve the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When one considers that Chernomyrdin is a possible candidate for
presidency in the year 2000, a more radical but unpopular solution
to the situation would be difficult to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Yeltsin has dismissed deputies whenever his abilities
have come into question.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Yeltsin merely wanted to fend off a political
crisis brewing over the ruble's devaluation one day earlier, which
could have precipitated a vote of non-confidence in the Duma?
Chernomyrdin is, after all, popular with the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this latest move will rescue Yeltsin _ and Russia _ in
the end remains to be seen. &QL;

BEIJING: to the capital. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was ready to rest anywhere. Even an open-air tower that
smelled as if it was home to a family of mountain goats looked
inviting. But we walked until we arrived at a restored 2-story
tower in the Jinshanling section of the wall, about a four-hour
hike east of Simatai. We had seen no beverage peddlers, so Simon
went to a nearby village to buy beer and water.
</P>
<P>
   As we settled in, we realized that we had stopped near a tiny
souvenir shop alongside the wall. In what looked like a large tool
shed, a kind man sold cookies, picture books, warm sodas, water and
the slide film I'd had such a hard time finding at a decent price
in Beijing. I had to barter to get a roll for $4 at a booth in the
Forbidden City, but now I bought a roll for $3.
</P>
<P>
   As the man prepared to go home, he offered us his bench and the
last of his hot water. The Chinese drink loads of tea and eat lots
of dehydrated noodles, so many of them carry hot water to work in
huge tanks that look like a cross between a fire extinguisher and a
small bomb. This precious gift meant we could eat our own bowls of
dehydrated noodles immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Then we discovered why Yang Yang's pack was so heavy. She and
Yang Xiao were loaded down with all sorts of food _ tomatoes,
cucumbers, fruit, dried bean curd _ and were eager to share. I
divvied up my dark chocolate candy bar and my flask of apple
brandy. Yang Xiao got the first sip for retrieving my extra
T-shirt, which had fallen over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't pack hiking boots, so I had worn heavy-soled rafting
sandals. They did a good job of gripping the sandy slopes and rocky
grades. Still, the hike had hurt my feet. I'd worn holes in my
socks, but at least there were no blisters or blood. I wiped my
feet with moist towelettes, massaged them with peppermint lotion
and promised to treat them better if they'd get me through one more
day.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness descended on the mountains, we rested and drank the
beers Simon had bought. Meng Fen and Yang Yang analyzed our
personalities, using Chinese astrology. Then the conversation
turned to my impressions of China.
</P>
<P>
   Meng Fen asked if I felt weird around people speaking Chinese. I
didn't. The language is pure music, even if its intricate system of
tones makes conversation sound a little like a record played
backward. There are lots of foreigners in Beijing, so most people I
encountered understood some English. Even when I flew to Qingdao,
east-coast home of the famous Chinese beer, I happened across
several people who spoke fluent English, including one businessman
from Hong Kong who helped me order lunch. But travelers in rural
areas probably need someone in their group who has a firm command
of the native dialects.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was chilly, so I was thankful to have a sweater. We
stretched our tired muscles and curled up in our sleeping bags. I'd
hoped to wake before dawn and watch the sun rise, but we slept well
into the morning. The wall was almost as brutal to sleep on as it
was to climb.
</P>
<P>
   THE PERILOUS PASSAGE: ``Mancou!'' Simon said as we set out that
morning on steep declines dusted with slippery pebbles. Pronounced
``MANT-zoh,'' it sounds a lot like ``gung-ho'' but means ``take it
easy.'' ``Dui,'' I said, heeding his advice.
</P>
<P>
   A day too late, the peddlers found us. They had no beer, and I
already had plenty of water. One woman tried to sell me a hardbound
book of pictures. She suggested the book as a souvenir, but I only
saw unnecessary weight. ``Bu ke xie,'' we said, politely declining,
but she followed us for a few hundred yards. ``Bu yao!'' Simon
called. ``Don't want any.'' She finally gave up when we approached
someone else's marketing territory.
</P>
<P>
   The next salesperson carried only a few small books. He wasn't
as insistent, so when it became clear we weren't buying, he joined
our group, squatting with us during our many rest breaks to smoke
one of the strongest legal cigarettes I've ever smelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigarettes are good for you,'' he said in Chinese. Maybe he's
right, because he passed me on a 45-degree grade without breathing
hard.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman told us his name is Chang Fu Hua. He pointed toward
farmland on one side of the wall. He told us the land has been sold
to an American company to build a ``holiday village.'' The
villagers have moved and the road is built, he said. A big hotel,
shops, restaurants and maybe a cable car to the wall were in the
works. We sighed, and I snapped a picture.
</P>
<P>
   As we approached another tower, the wall narrowed to 2 feet. The
drop had to be 50 feet. It was so precarious that the trail veered
off the side of the wall and rejoined at a lower, wider spot.
</P>
<P>
   I paused at the narrow expanse. Chang took one look at me and
pointed toward the lower path. Pride wouldn't allow me to take the
safer route. My heart beat hard. I took my first slow steps toward
the tower. Then, up from behind, came the cigarette-smoking
salesman, making me more nervous by gently touching my elbows when
notches in the wall narrowed the path to about 8 inches. Knees
shaking and pumped full of adrenaline, I made it to the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we asked Chang to carry Yang Yang's backpack. When
he finally departed, we gave him the equivalent of $1.20 for his
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The muffled chatter of tourists grew louder and the wall became
cleaner, wider and sturdier as we approached Simatai. We avoided a
guy at a gate who tried to make us pay about $2 for admission.
</P>
<P>
   In all, we'd traversed about 1.6 percent of the Great Wall.
After two days of M keing immersed in China's beauty, I was sad to
leave. I'd left sweat and skin from my left knee on the Great Wall,
but in return the wall gave me a sense of accomplishment. That's my
kind of closure.

DISCOVERING CONNECTICUT'S `QUIET CORNER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Conn. _ It's a step back in time. A quieter time, when
America was still a colony and small villages dotted the landscape
of rolling hills and lush valleys. A time when elegant
center-chimney Colonial homes rimmed the village common and white
church spires reached toward clear skies. A time when miles of
stone walls were built to keep cows and horses from straying too
far.
</P>
<P>
   These towns still exist today in what is called the ``Quiet
Corner'' of northeastern Connecticut. Although very much a part of
the 21st century, they remain dressed in the clothes of our rural
and agrarian past.
</P>
<P>
   Meandering through Canterbury, Brooklyn, Pomfret, and Woodstock
is Route 169, a 32-mile stretch of roadway that was designated a
National Scenic Byway by the US Department of Transportation in
1996. There are no fast-food joints along this road, whose
existence can be traced to the 1600s. There are no malls or large
grocery stores. No huge signs advertising cigarettes, cars, or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of elegant pre-1855 homes, large and unique
barns, acres of cornfields and pastures rimmed by stone walls, and
orchards, old graveyards, and sparkling white churches. There are a
few spots where metal storage buildings impose their ugly square
shapes on their pastoral surroundings, but a blink of the eye will
bring travelers quickly to the next Georgian house or Greek revival
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Although the beauty of the land and the architecture is enough
for some tourists who are seeking quiet, untraveled byways, the
area has other drawing cards as well. Many of the large homes have
been converted into comfortable bed-and-breakfasts. Other homes and
large barns are now restaurants that rival big-city establishments.
Putnam, a former near-ghost town, has been given a second lease on
life by becoming one of the largest antiques centers in New
England. And other businesses have moved into the area and are
thriving, such as Martha's Herbary and the Sharpe Winery, both in
Pomfret.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby woodlands, rivers, ponds, lakes, and country roads are
perfect for hiking, biking, fishing, camping, canoeing, and golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what attracts people is the rural quality of the
area,'' says Nini Davis, director of the Northeast Connecticut
Visitors District. ``It's a very peaceful and relaxed atmosphere
with no skyscrapers or a lot of traffic. We are between Sturbridge
and Mystic Seaport but we are the real thing _ we are not recreated
here.''
</P>
<P>
   To backtrack a bit. During the American Revolution, there were
no battles in this region, and it became the provision state
providing food and other supplies to Colonial troops. With the
onset of the Industrial Revolution, settlers assembled seasonal
gristmills and sawmills. Then, in the early 1800s, textile mills
were built. The textile owners continued to run family farms of 100
acres or more, and it was these farmers, far more wealthy than
those in Vermont or other parts of Connecticut, who built the large
homes that remain today.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s, most of the textile mills have shut their
doors. Dairy farms remain but most farmers have switched to raising
beef cattle and growing fruits, berries, flowers, herbs, and
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Canterbury, the town at the southern end of the scenic highway,
was settled in 1697 and incorporated in 1703. Many large Colonial
homes dot the road, and one notable example of ``Canterbury style''
architecture is the 1805 Prudence Crandall Federal/Georgian house.
Now a museum and historic landmark, it was the first academy to
open for black students in 1833. But headmistress Crandall, her
school, and her students were so harassed by the locals that she
was forced to close the school after only one year.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road is the Friendship Valley Inn, a Georgian-style
house that was a stop on the underground railroad. In the 1830s, it
was owned by Quaker George Benson, who sheltered and supported
Prudence Crandall when the community turned its back on her.
Crandall gave the house its name in appreciation for the kindness
shown her by Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Now a bed-and-breakfast, the inn is owned by former Texans Bev
and Rusty Yates, a former school guidance counselor and architect.
This exquisitely decorated inn has five guest bedrooms with private
baths. The library, dining room, and living room have fireplaces
and breakfast is served in a sunny, glass-enclosed porch.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile from Friendship is the New England Center for
Contemporary Art. Paintings from around the world are displayed in
a four-story barn and a sculpture garden greets visitors as they
enter the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most charming spot in the area is marked by a carved
sign of a lamb with a golden collar. Take a left at the sign and
follow a long driveway with its corridor of tall oak trees leading
to a renovated barn that houses the award-winn

   UNDATED - If you're one of those people who never goes to
foreign films because you don't want to read subtitles, here's an
unusual compromise: an American movie that plays like a great
French or Italian slice-of-life film, but in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is a bittersweet tale about a teenage
girl coming of age under the trying circumstances of a family
falling apart at the seams, held together by gumption alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although this true-to-life movie is being marketed as a comedy,
it's not a laugh riot. The humor is tinged with sadness and
desperation, two of the elements that make you think you're
watching something produced in Europe, where real people and their
lives are more important than gross-out gags.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is not for everyone
(certainly not for the people who are advertising it), the film
will run deep for the right movie lovers.
</P>
<P>
   It features the most impressive performance so far this year, by
young Natasha Lyonne as a 15-year-old girl who raises herself
because there's no one to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1976, when Viv (Lyonne); her divorced father, Murray
(Alan Arkin); and her two brothers are the ``nomads of Beverly
Hills.'' They move from one cheap apartment to another because
Murray is always broke, making ends meet only by wheedling money
from his rich brother.
</P>
<P>
   When cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) comes to live with them, Murray
thinks his problems are solved: his brother will support them and
Rita can provide Viv with a woman's guidance. However, Viv has to
look after Rita while dealing with her budding sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is obviously a personal movie, the
first film from writer/director Tamara Jenkins. It has to be her
own family story. If you were making up a story like this, you'd
make it funnier, cleaner, less of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   To Jenkins' credit, she makes something special of that mess:
the story of a real girl's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is smart, sometimes shocking, but its
humor is reality-based. Nothing that happens to Viv and her family
is simply there for laughs. Every laugh is grounded by memory in a
moment of fondness or humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins tells her family story with affection but without
sentimentality. She is aware of her family's foibles and doesn't
pass them off as charming.
</P>
<P>
   The film might have been too painful without outstanding
performances from the entire cast.
</P>
<P>
   Tomei (``Unhook the Stars'') is jittery funny, while Arkin
(``Gattaca``) is appealingly pathetic as a hard-working guy full of
big notions, going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Corrigan (``(uffalo '66``), as Viv's would-be boyfriend,
gives the story tension with a subtly shifting character, so we're
never sure whether he's good for Viv or not.
</P>
<P>
   We want him to be because Lyonne (``Everyone Says I Love You'')
turns Viv into the most appealing teenage girl since Alicia
Silverstone in ``Clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne mixes an innocent sexuality with a brassy sensuality to
shape a teenage girl uncomfortable with her maturing body yet
wanting to find out what it's all about. Equally dumbfounded and
precocious, Viv moves resolutely forward because she has nowhere
else to go.
</P>
<P>
   You'll either be totally won over by her or wish the film had
subtitles so you didn't go in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' is rated R for profanity, nudity and
sex. 4 stars. &QL;

   She had ``pretty loose morals'' and has become a ``false
goddess,'' says the former archbishop of Canterbury. Up to a point,
Lord Coggan. It is not for a secular newspaper to lecture the
retired boss of the Church of England on theology, but isn't he
missing something important about the Christian message?
</P>
<P>
   Diana, Princess of Wales, was never going to qualify as a saint
in the colloquial sense _ someone whose personal morals are above
reproach _ but did Jesus not find the spirit of love and
forgiveness in all sorts of people?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit rich, too, for a leading churchman to speak ill
of the dead, when it could be argued that Diana communicated the
message of compassion more effectively than the established church
has for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is too much idolatry about, and we should be
clear about where it comes from and who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The build-up to the anniversary of her fatal car crash in Paris
has begun embarrassingly early. Many Sunday newspapers Sunday
contained full-color commemorative supplements. Newsnight had its
anniversary discussion long ago, and the television schedules are
already packed with Dianaphernalia. Yet there is still nearly a
week to go to Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy to blame the media as if it were a single
corporate conspiracy. There are, after all, the commemorative plate
makers, margarine manufacturers and even the prime minister himself
seeking to cash in on the cult of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   But primary responsibility for stoking the emotional overkill
must lie with the press and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   We hope that this week's Independent/ Harris opinion poll on the
subject of Diana will help wind down rather than contribute to this
process. It suggests that the British public are healthily downbeat
about her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional defense of media obsessions is that readers and
viewers demand them; not in this case, according to our survey.
About two-fifths of the population think the anniversary of Diana's
death should be ``specially marked'' in some way, but a majority,
53 percent, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   As for her legacy itself, large majorities say that her death _
and people's response to it _ has not changed us, either as a
country or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, for a minority her death was highly significant. For
them, her life stood as a shining example of how they could be more
compassionate themselves, and her death offered the nation the
chance to rededicate itself to caring values.
</P>
<P>
   An even smaller minority reacted violently against what they saw
as the mawkishness of public sentiment. But for most people the
Princess's death was less highly charged, beyond the usual
intimation of mortality: devastating for her sons, bleakly
beneficial to her former husband's campaign to restore his
miserable public standing, and a valuable chance to consider the
good causes that she espoused.
</P>
<P>
   She was, sadly, never the ``queen of people's hearts'' to which
she aspired, and she was only the ``people's princess'' in the
sense that she stood against those aspects of the monarchy that
most people want reformed: the stuffiness, the protocol and the
anti-democratic pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The public display of emotion that followed her death was
acclaimed as a touchy-feely revolution in national sensibility,
which it was not.
</P>
<P>
   There have been near-universal displays of public grief before,
but the form of this mourning was different from, for example, the
hundreds of thousands filing past Winston Churchill's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and weeping in public were, however, less her legacy
than a marker of trends underway for some time, especially that of
the growing emotional literacy of men.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, then, let us hope we can keep in perspective
what is valuable about Diana's legacy, while all around the media
lose their heads. &QL;

   OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine _ The Maple Leaf flutters alongside the
Stars and Stripes in the town square. Joseph's By The Sea offers
creton with its breakfast eggs; Munchies serves up poutine. The
laundromat on West Grand Avenue promises an ``agreable lessive.''
Bienvenue Canadiens, the signs say. Ici nous parlons Francais.
</P>
<P>
   For the Quebecois who've been flocking to this seaside resort
town 100 miles north of Boston for nearly a century and a half, Old
Orchard Beach is their Riviera, a surf-sand-sun playground that
speaks their language.
</P>
<P>
   Drive past the motels lining Saco Bay and you'll see
blue-and-white Je me souviens license plates in every parking lot.
Walk down the century-old pier or through the amusement park or
along the endless beach during July and early August and you'll
hear French spoken nearly as often as you will English.
</P>
<P>
   French Canadians come here because it's the nearest ocean beach.
They come here because it's a family resort with everything from
arcades to cotton candy. They come here because their parents and
grandparents came here. They come here in reduced numbers, because
the exchange rate between the Canadian and American dollars has
never been worse.
</P>
<P>
   The battered Canadian dollar has taken an undeniable toll on Old
Orchard Beach's business from up north this summer. Fewer Quebecois
have come, and those who have haven't stayed as long as they
usually do. The French-speaking colony here ebbs and flows with
``la monnaie,'' and this has been an ebb year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more expensive now,'' concedes Michel Lavallee, who has
been coming down from Sorel with his wife Lucy for a dozen years.
``But at the same time, when vacation comes, you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the loonie is worth only 66 cents, not even enough
for a ride on the Yo-yo at the Palace Playland, many French
Canadians still would rather drive five hours to come here than 10
hours to Nouveau Brunswick, especially if they're only staying a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten hours for three or four days is too much,'' says Helene
Jacques, who makes the annual pilgrimage down from Beauce with
husband Mario, son Keven, and daughter Jo-Annie. ``Five hours for
here is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Orchard is 295 miles from Montreal, 286 from Quebec City,
220 from Sherbrooke. The Quebecois used to make the trip by
horse-drawn carriage, then by train, riding the Grand Trunk
Railroad from Montreal to Portland. Now, they pile the family into
vans and Jeeps and campers before dawn and zip down through Vermont
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Once here, they can choose among more than 100 family-friendly
motels and apartment and condo complexes, many of them with names
such as Beau Rivage, Alouette, Mount Royal, Kebek, and Normandie.
</P>
<P>
   They can eat in restaurants such as the Bell Buoy that feature
bilingual menus in the windows. (One man's fried clams are another
man's palourdes frites.) They can find creton, the ground pork
spread that Memere used to make, or poutine, the cholesterol
trifecta of French fries covered with cheese and brown gravy. They
can pay in loonies. And they know that even though they're south of
the border, they can speak their language and be understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare case now where a French Canadian comes here and
can't at least speak enough English to get by,'' says Rudy
Bergeron, whose family runs White Cap Village, a
motel-condo-apartment complex. ``But they like to find someone who
speaks French because it's less embarrassing for them.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lure of the beach &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the taste of home is pleasant, the Quebecois don't
make the trip for the poutine. ``Why do they come here?'' says
Genevieve Arguin, who went to college in Sainte-Foy and has a
coveted summer job at the Beau Rivage, which pays in Yankee
dollars. ``The beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The old orchard, which mariners once used as a high-ground
landmark, is long gone, but the beach endures. Seven miles of
smooth beige sand, long and wide and firm enough that people used
to have auto races on it and send post-Lindbergh daredevils winging
across the Atlantic from it.
</P>
<P>
   The beach is the attraction. In 1929, the town fathers finally
gave in to the obvious and changed the name from Old Orchard to Old
Orchard Beach. Whenever the townspeople start talking about
changing the image, making the place less about dodgems and
Hawaiian shaved ice and temporary tattoos, they can't get past the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a Kennebunkport, with all the shops,'' says
Bergeron. ``We're not a Freeport, with L.L. Bean. We're still
basically a 12-week summer resort. This has always been a Coney
Island type of a place. The beach doesn't change. It's still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the great fire of 1907, when virtually everything along
the water was incinerated in four hellish hours, Old Orchard was a
stylish Victorian resort with grand hotels, where gentlemen wore
straw hats and ladies carried parasols.
</P>
<P>
   It was reborn as a ``Playground by the Sea'' with an amusement
park and a pier casino that offered vaudeville and big-band dancing
to Glenn Miller and Guy Lombardo on a waxed maple floor beneath a
crystal mirror ball. After the war, Old Orchard Beach evolved into
a beach town for working-class families, particularly the
Quebecois, who arrived en masse as soon as the Canadian building
industry shut down for the second half of July, turning up before
dawn to claim their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those two weeks when you walked down the street, all you
heard was French,'' says James Harmon, executive director of the
chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As late as the '60s, nearly 80 percent of the summer visitors
were Quebecois, most of whom came year after year. ``They would
make their reservations for the next year before they left,''
remembers Bergeron. ``Because they knew this would be their
vacation.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Attracting new visitors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The days of the mass migration are over. The building industry
no longer closes en bloc. Canadians, like Americans, are spending
less vacation time in more places. And the falling loonie has
belted them in the pocketbook. ``Some of our friends said: Are you
crazy going down there?'' says Mario Jacques, who has come here 15
times with Helene.
</P>
<P>
   As more Quebecois are going elsewhere, Old Orchard Beach has
been broadening its marketing base, reaching down to the Middle
Atlantic states and even across to England and Germany. ``There was
a feeling that we were putting all our eggs in one basket,'' says
Harmon, ``and that we should venture out a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, French Canadians still make up at least a third of the
100,000 summer visitors and nearly half during July. The chamber of
commerce's guide has two pages in French, conjuring up an alluring
vision of hot sand and rolling waves.
</P>
<P>
   The Quebecois are hard-core beachgoers. The men put on their
bikini briefs and the women their stylish maillots and spread their
blankets in the morning. They plunge headlong into the icy surf,
which they consider semitropical compared with Nouveau Brunswick
and Gaspesie. They build elaborate sand castles with moats and
crenelated ramparts. When the sun goes away and the breeze
stiffens, they wrap towels around their shoulders and ride it out.
One does not drive five hours to play skee ball. ``We are here for
la mer,'' says Helene Jacques. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reservation fever &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The phone at the Beau Rivage (Beautiful Seashore) begins ringing
in early spring, when the snow is still on the ground in
Trois-Rivieres and L'Epiphanie and Saint-Ferreol-les-Neiges.
``Reservation fever,'' says Jo-Ann Lapointe, who runs the motel
with husband John. The reservations are shorter now, and iffier,
because of the exchange rate. ``This year I'm getting a lot of:
``two days and we'll see what the weather is,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   But the Quebecois still came this summer, staying in motels with
kitchenettes, bringing their own groceries and cases of Labatt
bleue and maxing out on the breakfast buffet at Pierre's, where
$4.95 gets you all the scrambled eggs, baked ham, corned beef hash,
home fries, French toast, baked beans, fruit, cereal, doughnuts,
and coffee you can manage. On the way out, the cashier says, ``Vous
avez bien mange?'' assuming the diner speaks French.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacques family (Mario is a Shell truck driver, Helene a
secretary) came down from Beauce for four days at the end of July
and slept four to a room. They made their own breakfast, grabbed
lunch on the pier, cooked their own dinner (spaghetti, fondue,
hamburgers), and wrung every possible ray from the Maine sun. ``We
can do this for $600 Canadian,'' says Mario.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred loonies may go a lot further in Nouveau Brunswick or
Gaspesie, but the Old Orchard habit dies hard. ``I have been coming
here since I was 3 or 4,'' says Jacques Dubois, who drove down from
Sherbrooke in a Pathfinder with his wife and two daughters and
stayed where they always do, at the Crest Motel on East Grand,
where sandy toes are a few dozen steps away. ``You can say at least
40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, The season is longer for the Quebecois. They book
through August and even on Columbus Day weekend, which dovetails
with their Thanksgiving. That is when the town begins shutting
down, and Old Orchard Beach's hosts can finally think about where
they might travel. ``My wife and I are going to take a vacation in
Canada this fall,'' says Rudy Bergeron. ``You can get a great room
there for $50 now.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ My visit to Beijing was nearly over.
</P>
<P>
   I'd ridden a bike to Tiananmen Square, where elaborate kites
flew under the stern watch of Chairman Mao. I'd demanded a refund
from a Chinese cabdriver. I'd even taken a bite of a bean curd dish
that looked like a brownie but smelled like a cow patty. I'll bet
cow patties taste better.
</P>
<P>
   Big cities can be fun, but I can take only so much of them. I
hadn't seen the countryside, and I hadn't seen the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   My original plan was to spend part of an afternoon at Mutanyu or
Badaling, two of the three restored portions of the wall. Badaling
is 35 miles north of Beijing. Mutanyu is about 45 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Badaling was refurbished in 1957. It's the most polished, with
its smooth brick walks, stairs and guardrails. Nearby are
restaurants, souvenir shops and an IMAX-like theater. Badaling is
so crowded, it has added a cable car to speed tourist flow. Mutanyu
is not quite as bad. Neither seemed to offer the wall experience I
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Johnson, my host in Beijing, suggested that I join some of
her friends on a 25-mile hike on the wall from Gubeikou to Simatai,
another restored section about 55 miles northeast of the city. Then
she told me her horror story. Judy doesn't scare easily, but when
she went on a daylong hike on one of the rough stretches, the Great
Wall's unrestored slippery grades and crumbling rock put fear into
her. Alan, her unofficial wall guide, saved her from falling, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-MILE HIKE: Two days before I was to board a plane back
home, five of Judy's friends and I paid a total of $48 to hire a
small bus to Gubeikou, our starting point on the wall. Alan, who is
from Britain, once worked at ``China Daily'' as a copy editor, or
foreign expert, as they're called. Meng Fen, his wife, is of
Mongolian ancestry. They had hiked the wall several times and
decided that walking from east to west _ from a rough section to
the restored point at Simatai _ was the best route. Meng Fen's
friend Yang Yang and Yang Xiao, her husband, are Chinese. Judy's
next-door neighbor Simon, an Australian, completed our group.
</P>
<P>
   We rode the bus for about two hours, snacking on hot street food
and snoozing. When we arrived at Gubeikou, all six of us ducked
into what looked like the only restaurant in town and ate hearty
plates of salted, roasted peanuts, noodles in broth, stir-fried
green beans and chicken. We paid a total of $7. As I successfully
picked up peanuts with chopsticks, Meng Fen complimented me on my
skill. I was glad to be handy with them, because I don't recall
seeing any silverware at restaurants during my trip.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the wall, we walked above terraced farmlands and
through groves of walnut trees. Meng Fen shouted greetings to the
few people we saw working the land. Soon, the sloping hills gave
way to eroding stone that protruded like varicose veins from the
mountain ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to postcard views of the Great Wall photographed at
its most spruced-up sections, I asked when we would reach it. In
fact, we were there.
</P>
<P>
   On some parts of our 25-mile hike, the wall was about as wide as
a grocery-store aisle. Other times, it was broad enough for a car.
Most sections were narrow and overgrown with weeds and bushes. The
Great Wall is really two walls with soil or rock between them. Most
of the unrestored sections are in some state of ruin made even
worse by locals who pirate stones for their own building projects.
</P>
<P>
   The wall was our hiking path for most of the trip. At one point,
it narrowed and rose a few hundred feet to a dizzying height above
a meadow. Everyone but the athletic, compact Yang Xiao left the
wall and climbed back on only after it had widened again.
</P>
<P>
   The early-May weather was almost perfect for hiking, with a
temperature in the mid-70s and overcast skies. A breeze cooled my
sweaty neck. The fresh air and the silence were a welcome contrast
to the haze and traffic of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Wall is the largest defensive barrier ever built. It
stretches about 1,500 miles from Shanhaiguan Pass on the east coast
of China to Jiayuguan Pass in the Gobi Desert. Many travel books
say it's the only man-made object visible from space.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 years ago, Emperor Qin Shihuang unified China at a
time when it had many kingdoms, each with its own wall. The emperor
hoped, unsuccessfully, that the combined walls would keep out
nomads from the north. It did serve as a raised highway for
transporting people and equipment. Now it is China's biggest
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A few rural folk also walk the wall, offering tourists water,
beer and souvenir books. The hope of finding someone selling an
ice-cold drink motivated me as the relentless hills gradually
sapped the strength from my legs.
</P>
<P>
   After the first few miles, many of which were vertical, I
understood the wall's true, cruel nature. As we hauled our full
loads up 50-, 60- and 70-degree grades, I groaned. But all those
squats and walking lunges at the gym finally paid off. Countless
hills rose before us, but I was determined not to give up. I just
enjoyed whining a little.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery was continuously breathtaking. Distant mountain
ranges seemed to change from green to blue-gray to pale gray. Up
close, the wall was daunting. As we pressed on, I occasionally
looked back, hardly believing we were scaling the spine of this
man-made dragon.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, we approached a restored area of the wall. After
six hours of hiking, we looked for a guard tower where we could
camp and sleep. We had seen several on our hike, some small and
roofless, others larger with individual chambers. Hundreds of years
ago, sentries manned the towers, setting wolf dung on fire to send
smoke signals, transmitting word of invaders to the capital.

   She had ``pretty loose morals'' and has become a ``false
goddess,'' says the former archbishop of Canterbury. Up to a point,
Lord Coggan. It is not for a secular newspaper to lecture the
retired boss of the Church of England on theology, but isn't he
missing something important about the Christian message?
</P>
<P>
   Diana, Princess of Wales, was never going to qualify as a saint
in the colloquial sense _ someone whose personal morals are above
reproach _ but did Jesus not find the spirit of love and
forgiveness in all sorts of people?
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit rich, too, for a leading churchman to speak ill
of the dead, when it could be argued that Diana communicated the
message of compassion more effectively than the established church
has for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is too much idolatry about, and we should be
clear about where it comes from and who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The build-up to the anniversary of her fatal car crash in Paris
has begun embarrassingly early. Many Sunday newspapers Sunday
contained full-color commemorative supplements. Newsnight had its
anniversary discussion long ago, and the television schedules are
already packed with Dianaphernalia. Yet there is still nearly a
week to go to Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy to blame the media as if it were a single
corporate conspiracy. There are, after all, the commemorative plate
makers, margarine manufacturers and even the prime minister himself
seeking to cash in on the cult of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   But primary responsibility for stoking the emotional overkill
must lie with the press and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   We hope that this week's Independent/ Harris opinion poll on the
subject of Diana will help wind down rather than contribute to this
process. It suggests that the British public are healthily downbeat
about her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional defense of media obsessions is that readers and
viewers demand them; not in this case, according to our survey.
About two-fifths of the population think the anniversary of Diana's
death should be ``specially marked'' in some way, but a majority,
53 percent, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   As for her legacy itself, large majorities say that her death _
and people's response to it _ has not changed us, either as a
country or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, for a minority her death was highly significant. For
them, her life stood as a shining example of how they could be more
compassionate themselves, and her death offered the nation the
chance to rededicate itself to caring values.
</P>
<P>
   An even smaller minority reacted violently against what they saw
as the mawkishness of public sentiment. But for most people the
Princess's death was less highly charged, beyond the usual
intimation of mortality: devastating for her sons, bleakly
beneficial to her former husband's campaign to restore his
miserable public standing, and a valuable chance to consider the
good causes that she espoused.
</P>
<P>
   She was, sadly, never the ``queen of people's hearts'' to which
she aspired, and she was only the ``people's princess'' in the
sense that she stood against those aspects of the monarchy that
most people want reformed: the stuffiness, the protocol and the
anti-democratic pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The public display of emotion that followed her death was
acclaimed as a touchy-feely revolution in national sensibility,
which it was not.
</P>
<P>
   There have been near-universal displays of public grief before,
but the form of this mourning was different from, for example, the
hundreds of thousands filing past Winston Churchill's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and weeping in public were, however, less her legacy
than a marker of trends underway for some time, especially that of
the growing emotional literacy of men.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, then, let us hope we can keep in perspective
what is valuable about Diana's legacy, while all around the media
lose their heads. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The reign of ``Czar'' Boris Yeltsin has entered its
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   His television appearance Monday to explain why he had
reappointed a prime minister whom he sacked only five months ago
was not quite as humiliating as a prime-time confession to an
affair with a White House intern. But it was bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of a premier who is widely disliked, and whose name
is associated with fudge, economic decline, and cronyism, is a
personal defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin knows he will be seen as having buckled under the
pressure of a narrow clique of oligarchs who exploited the
privatization of state assets to build vast fortunes _ and
subsequently used them to pressure the Kremlin to defend their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last 48 hours may also mark a larger
watershed in the rule of Boris Yeltsin, a seven year helter-skelter
ride in which he has veered across the political spectrum, from
autocrat to rough-hewn democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The snowy-haired man who in 1991 stood on a tank outside the
White House, flourishing his democratic credentials in the face of
drunken Communist coup plotters, also launched war in Chechnya,
surrounded himself with hard-liners, and used tanks to bombard a
recalcitrant parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by hard-living, heart trouble and the sheer enormity
of the task of trying to pilot the country through the post-Soviet
chaos, this same contradictory man may now have concluded that it
is time to ease his way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the president is starting to withdraw from
office step by step, handing over power to the heir,'' said his
arch-enemy Mikhail Gorbachev. For once, the former Soviet leader's
views did not sound purely like sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin loves power, and is a master at centralizing it on
the Kremlin. He is also incorrigibly unpredictable, whether it be
his ludicrous exploits _ drunkenly conducting an orchestra in
Berlin, pinching a secretary _ or in politics.
</P>
<P>
   He proved that yet again on Sunday, sacking his government at
the height of a fiscal crisis, adding political chaos and limbo to
the economic maelstrom. What he does today, he can _ and often does
_ undo tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the case of Anatoly Chubais, his financial
troubleshooter whom he has sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the zealous Sergei Kiriyenko was almost certainly
fired because he was construed as a threat to the oligarchs'
empires _ which are rooted in energy, banking and the media.
Several of them feared his government would allow their banks to
collapse, unable to pay vast foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   But, having bankrolled Yeltsin's election campaign in 1996, they
appear to have called in the favor by demanding _ and getting _ a
compliant prime minister. (The country's most prominent oligarch,
Boris Berezovsky, Monday warmly welcomed the appointment of
Chernomyrdin, a development which his own newspaper _ Nezavisimaya
Gazeta _ foresaw with suspicious accuracy last week.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet signs are beginning to surface which suggest Yeltsin may now
have accepted his rule is winding down.
</P>
<P>
   The well-connected Ekho Moskvi radio station quoted sources
saying Chernomyrdin had insisted, as a condition of his return to
office, that he has the right to appoint the head of the ``power
ministries'' _ the Interior Ministry, the Federal Security
Services, and the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands the importance of retaining control over the
security forces better than Yeltsin. If the story is true, then it
amounts to a significant reduction of his sweeping powers.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the nation Monday, the President clearly
anointed Chernomyrdin as his preferred successor in the election of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   His departure cannot come too soon for his growing army of
critics, whose ranks embrace the majority of Russians, almost all
the lower house of parliament, and plenty of enraged international
investors, who view Chernomyrdin's appointment as the kiss of death
to Russia's efforts to make the transition to a healthy market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the evidence that Yeltsin is no longer up to the
job. Although he appeared to recover well from the quintuple
coronary bypass surgery in late 1996, questions have repeatedly
arisen over Yeltsin's mental state.
</P>
<P>
   This is theme which has a bleak familiarity for the Siberian
former construction boss who these days appears far older than his
67 years. He has long been prone to bouts of depression and
withdrawal, and has openly admitted to ``dark thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   A best-selling kiss'n'tell by his former bodyguard and estranged
friend Alexander Korzhakov claimed that in past years Yeltsin twice
tried to commit suicide by leaping into the Moscow River and
locking himself in a steam baths.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly little doubt that he had a nervous breakdown
when he was banished by Mikhail Gorbachev to the Soviet
construction ministry in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has retained a gift for springing political
surprises, as he demonstrated by his brilliantly judged last-minute
appearance at the reburial of the last czar, Nicholas, in St.
Petersburg last month, the number of embarrassments has grown with
the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Sweden late last year, he appeared unsure of
where he was, and seemed to think Germany and Japan possessed
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he blotted his copybook again by appearing to refer
to the U.S. attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan as an ``act of
terrorism.'' (His spokesman hastily offered a watered-down version
of Russia's position).
</P>
<P>
   And only three days before the government announced its decision
to devalue the ruble last Monday, Yeltsin was publicly declaring
that devaluation ``won't happen... It is not a question of what I
think, of my own fantasies, of what I do or do not want to see. It
is all calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   True, this may have been a last-ditch _ and, as it turned out,
vain _ attempt to build confidence in the beleaguered currency; but
it is as likely that he was simply out of touch. After all, he had
been on vacation for five weeks despite a rapidly worsening
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   How long he will stay in the Kremlin now depends on several
factors.
</P>
<P>
   He is mindful of his place in history which, while recognizing
his faults, will at least give him credit for holding the first
democratic transfer of power in Russia for 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he will want to be sure that Chernomyrdin (or a
similar ally) stands a strong chance of succeeding him, and will
defend the interests of the ruling elite that has evolved during
the Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   This could conceivably mean striking a deal with the
Communist-nationalist opposition which includes rewriting the
constitution to allow the president to be appointed not by popular
vote, but by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And much rests on the advice of the so-called Kremlin ``Family''
_ dominated by his daughter and image-maker, Tatyana, and his chief
of staff, Valentin Yumashev.
</P>
<P>
   As Russians look on with bewilderment as the Kremlin staggers
from one disaster to another, there are plenty who hope that the
old man's aides will now gently tap him on the shoulder, and point
to the door. &QL;

PERSECUTION OF MCGWIRE IS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Hawaii and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder ballplayers loathe the media. Mark McGwire is stalking
one of baseball's most cherished records _ until now the feel-good
story of the baseball summer _ and suddenly he's engaged in a
tabloid-driven controversy that's painting him as a cheater and a
bad role model.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair.
</P>
<P>
   If you just dropped in from a two-week trip to Guam, here's the
background: An Associated Press reporter noticed a jar of
androstenedione in McGwire's locker last week. He asked the slugger
about the stuff, did some homework, and wrote about it.
Androstenedione, known in baseball clubhouses as ``andro,'' is an
all-natural, over-the-counter steroid (not of the dangerous
anabolic steroid family) that is used to help an athlete train
harder and recover faster. It is banned by the NFL, the NCAA, and
the Olympics, but allowed by the NHL, NBA, and Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   There. McGwire takes something that can be sold at any drugstore
and is permitted by his sport, and suddenly he's lumped with
Olympic swimmer Michelle Smith and sprinter Ben Johnson, a couple
of champs who got the gold using illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, America. The IOC has bans on caffeine limits. Juan
Antonio Samaranch would strip McGwire's medal if he went to the
plate after consuming eight cups of Maxwell House.
</P>
<P>
   The story of McGwire's historic home run chase is being
tarnished because folks are hearing bits of stories and reading
wild headlines and concluding that Big Mac is a pharmaceutical
creation.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is not some 98-pound weakling who went on the juice and
came back as Rambo. He is a huge, muscular man, who hit 49 home
runs in his first big league season 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Globe, a doctor claims that andro is part of
McGwire's success. This makes it sound as if the substance is
adding 40 feet to McGwire's long fly balls. This is ridiculous.
Andro might help McGwire stay healthy and aid his recovery time
from injuries, but the same could be said about aspirin, or any
other pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   If a slugger eats Wheaties (sold over the counter, not banned by
MLB) wouldn't it be true that Wheaties are part of his success?
What about steak? Is prime rib part of McGwire's success?
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's case, it is misleading to write that he's using a
``performance-enhancing drug.'' He's a baseball player, not an
Olympic sprinter. There's nothing sold at drugstores that would
help any of us hit a home run in the big leagues (unless the store
has a book on hitting written by Ted Williams). Facing Randy
Johnson and hitting a ball over the fence requires bravery, timing,
hand-eye coordination, reflexes, leverage, and strength. Most of
all, it requires practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, how many other baseball players are taking the same
stuff? McGwire probably doesn't go more than a couple of days
without hitting against a pitcher who uses andro. While we're at
it, what about creatine, another dietary supplement sold over the
counter, also used by McGwire? What about MET-Rx (endorsed on radio
and in print by Mo Vaughn)?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, McGwire's been a good citizen, never one
to disgrace the uniform. Most recently he's dedicated his charity
efforts to awareness and funding for abused children. And now he's
got to read that he's a bad example to young athletes? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps andro will be proven unsafe. That is an issue for the
Food and Drug Administration and for Major League Baseball and its
Players Association. In the meantime, McGwire should be left alone
on this issue and go back to answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. We've all heard the stories about Roger Maris's hair
falling out from stress when he chased Babe Ruth's record in the
summer of 1961. Turns out Roger was lucky. He didn't play in 1998
when you can do something legal and be painted as a cheater.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Babe himself? The Bambino hit 60 homers in
1927, which was the seventh year of prohibition in this country.
Think the Babe might have had a little bathtub gin coursing through
his veins at any point during the '27 season?
</P>
<P>
   Hope not. After all, it would have been a bad message for
America's youth.

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The chief mastermind of the firing of the Russian
government, heralding the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin,
has emerged as a 51-year-old tycoon who made his fortune as a car
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the country's most prominent oligarch, is the
principle broker in a deal which restored the sacked Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister and established himself as the power
behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Moscow say the billionaire businessman recently
secretly met the premier and a senior Kremlin official _ deputy
chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasalov _ in the French resort of
Cannes, thousands of miles from the economic maelstrom which was
engulfing Russia, shaking the empires of its new oligarchs to their
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting proposal to replace the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko, after only four months in office, was relayed to Boris
Yeltsin by his younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, both friends of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The key question now taxing the minds of Russia's political
supporters and creditors in the West is the nature of the influence
that Berezovsky, and a coterie of other tycoons, will undoubtedly
wield in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin's past record suggests he broadly favors
market economics, he is also a former chief executive of the gas
giant Gazprom, and tends to protect the interests of his chums in
business and the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   It says much about the entwined nature of power and cronyism in
Russia that Gazprom shares rocketed by 20 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The signs so far are ominous. Chernomyrdin has told a newspaper
he wants to concentrate on ``industrial policy, since purely
monetary measures have not pulled Russia out of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been carefully courting the major parliamentary
groups (who have yet to confirm him in post) and has talked about
creating a ``broad-based government of accord,'' raising the
possibility of a coalition government, including the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   To the ears of advocates of market reforms, such words are
anathema, and spell a rise in government interventionism and
spending. One of their camp, Anders Asland, a former adviser to
Russia, has described Chernomyrdin's return as ``a total
disaster.''

   MOSCOW _ The chief mastermind of the firing of the Russian
government, heralding the beginning of the end for Boris Yeltsin,
has emerged as a 51-year-old tycoon, who made his fortune as a car
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the country's most prominent oligarch, is the
principle broker in a deal which restored the sacked Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister and established himself as the power
behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Moscow say the billionaire businessman recently
secretly met the premier and a senior Kremlin official _ deputy
chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasalov _ in the French resort of
Cannes, thousands of miles from the economic maelstrom which was
engulfing Russia, shaking the empires of its new oligarchs to their
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting proposal to replace the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko, after only four months in office, was relayed to Boris
Yeltsin by his younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and chief of
staff, Valentin Yumashev, both friends of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The key question now taxing the minds of Russia's political
supporters and creditors in the West is the nature of the influence
that Berezovsky, and a coterie of other tycoons, will undoubtedly
wield in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin's past record suggests he broadly favors
market economics, he is also a former chief executive of the gas
giant Gazprom, and tends to protect the interests of his chums in
business and the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   It says much about the entwined nature of power and cronyism in
Russia that Gazprom shares rocketed by 20 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The signs so far are ominous. Chernomyrdin has told a newspaper
he wants to concentrate on ``industrial policy, since purely
monetary measures have not pulled Russia out of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been carefully courting the major parliamentary
groups (who have yet to confirm him in post) and has talked about
creating a ``broad-based government of accord,'' raising the
possibility of a coalition government, including the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   To the ears of advocates of market reforms, such words are
anathema, and spell a rise in government interventionism and
spending. One of their camp, Anders Asland, a former adviser to
Russia, has described Chernomyrdin's return as ``a total
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, tasks regarded as crucial by the IMF _ like raising
Russia's lamentable tax revenues and cutting the state's huge
subsidies to energy and housing _ can be expected to lose what
little momentum they have.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be one of the reasons why Berezovksky has anointed
Chernomyrdin both as the premier and, it is safe to assume, the man
whom he sees as heir to Boris Yelstin's throne.

   One summer night in 1992, I interviewed Sudan's President Omar
el-Bashir in the mud fortress in Khartoum that passes for a
``presidential palace.'' It was guarded by dozens of Islamic
boy-soldiers with automatic weapons and faulty walkie-talkies. One
was so defective that it almost got my Sudanese escort and I shot
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When their officer couldn't raise the security staff inside, two
soldiers suddenly dropped to their knees in the glare of our
headlamps. I stared through the windscreen for minutes at their
knuckles on the triggers, until my Sudanese friend persuaded them
to borrow his own mobile phone. Finally, we were waved through the
gate into a dark medieval casbah.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the cruise missiles hit Khartoum, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, said that the
destroyed factory was part of Sudan's military-industrial complex.
That's an audacious piece of spin.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week in the heart of Sudan's ``military-industrial
complex,'' with its malarial mosquitoes, streets covered in sand
and relics of Britain's colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is the largest country in Africa and one of the poorest,
paralyzed by years of civil war and corruption. When Brigadier
el-Bashir staged his military coup in 1989, the country was in
total chaos and the central bank had just $25,000 in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   I met President el-Bashir in a lounge full of old sofas where he
sat surrounded by half a dozen men. The president is a tall,
fiercely dignified man. He was dressed, like all his aides, in the
flowing white desert robes and turbans that the stylish hog farmers
of Arkansas disdain.
</P>
<P>
   In short, el-Bashir and his men were all ``towel heads.'' One, a
ferocious-looking young Nubian, told me that he'd recently
graduated from Harvard. Considering how he was dressed, I figured
he must be a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is one of the few modern republics where the legal and
economic system is based on Islamic sharia law. Knowing this, you'd
imagine that its president is a dangerous lunatic, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize that terrorism is something
completely alien to Islam,'' President el-Bashir told me, in a deep
rolling voice. ``Islam does not condone it, does not approve of it.
Human life is sacred to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Did this fundamentalist leader of Sudan's
``military-industrial'' complex really expect me to believe him?
</P>
<P>
   A year after my visit to Khartoum, the State Department put
Sudan on its list of nations who support international terrorism.
The justification? ``There is no evidence that the Government of
Sudan conducted or sponsored a specific terrorist attack in the
past year, and the Government denies supporting any form of
terrorism activity,'' said the State Department report at the time.
Confused? Not me, I was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   But former president Jimmy Carter was not. He criticized the
listing of Sudan at the time, saying there was no evidence to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is too much of an inclination in this country to
look on Muslims as inherently terrorist or inherently against the
West,'' Carter said in this newspaper in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that Sudan showed ``a disturbing
pattern of relationships with international terrorist groups.''
That means, as one Hamas official said in 1995, that Sudan is where
you come when you've got nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, Sudan naively allowed any Arabs to enter without a
visa, seeing itself as an oasis of pure Islamic faith, unlike
neighbor Saudi Arabia, which they regarded as too close to the
non-Muslim Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   President el-Bashir ended Sudan's non-visa entry policy in May
1996. At the same time, notorious Saudi terrorist Osama bin-Laden
was booted out of Sudan. (That didn't fool me.)
</P>
<P>
   His expulsion came a year after the Sudanese government had
arrested and extradited Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as the
terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal,'' to France. (I wasn't impressed by
that either.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a man from the U.S. State Department,'' el-Bashir
told me. ``I said if you know of any terrorist training camps, then
bring your elite forces and we'll bring our special forces and
we'll go together to eliminate these camps, if they really exist.''
You'd expect a towel-head to say something like that.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in Sunday's Observer, U.S. intelligence
told the President Clinton that there were no traces of nerve gas
production in the factory his missiles were going to hit. He fired
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger explained that Clinton acted in order to enhance
``the psychological dimension of power'' against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Bill Clinton is a good and courageous leader, not a
liar and a bully. I mean, look at what nice ties he wears. &QL;

   Sudan is the largest country in Africa and one of the poorest,
paralyzed by years of civil war and corruption. When Brigadier
el-Bashir staged his military coup in 1989, the country was in
total chaos and the central bank had just $25,000 in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   I met President el-Bashir in a lounge full of old sofas where he
sat surrounded by half a dozen men. The president is a tall,
fiercely dignified man. He was dressed, like all his aides, in the
flowing white desert robes and turbans that the stylish hog farmers
of Arkansas disdain.
</P>
<P>
   In short, el-Bashir and his men were all ``towel heads.'' One, a
ferocious-looking young Nubian, told me that he'd recently
graduated from Harvard. Considering how he was dressed, I figured
he must be a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is one of the few modern republics where the legal and
economic system is based on Islamic sharia law. Knowing this, you'd
imagine that its president is a dangerous lunatic, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize that terrorism is something
completely alien to Islam,'' President el-Bashir told me, in a deep
rolling voice. ``Islam does not condone it, does not approve of it.
Human life is sacred to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Did this fundamentalist leader of Sudan's
``military-industrial'' complex really expect me to believe him?
</P>
<P>
   A year after my visit to Khartoum, the State Department put
Sudan on its list of nations who support international terrorism.
The justification? ``There is no evidence that the Government of
Sudan conducted or sponsored a specific terrorist attack in the
past year, and the Government denies supporting any form of
terrorism activity,'' said the State Department report at the time.
Confused? Not me, I was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   But former president Jimmy Carter was not. He criticized the
listing of Sudan at the time, saying there was no evidence to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is too much of an inclination in this country to
look on Muslims as inherently terrorist or inherently against the
West,'' Carter said in this newspaper in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said that Sudan showed ``a disturbing
pattern of relationships with international terrorist groups.''
That means, as one Hamas official said in 1995, that Sudan is where
you come when you've got nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, Sudan naively allowed any Arabs to enter without a
visa, seeing itself as an oasis of pure Islamic faith, unlike
neighbor Saudi Arabia, which they regarded as too close to the
non-Muslim Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   President el-Bashir ended Sudan's non-visa entry policy in May
1996. At the same time, notorious Saudi terrorist Osama bin-Laden
was booted out of Sudan. (That didn't fool me.)
</P>
<P>
   His expulsion came a year after the Sudanese government had
arrested and extradited Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as the
terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal,'' to France. (I wasn't impressed by
that either.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a man from the U.S. State Department,'' el-Bashir
told me. ``I said if you know of any terrorist training camps, then
bring your elite forces and we'll bring our special forces and
we'll go together to eliminate these camps, if they really exist.''
You'd expect a towel-head to say something like that.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in Sunday's Observer, U.S. intelligence
told the President Clinton that there were no traces of nerve gas
production in the factory his missiles were going to hit. He fired
them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger explained that Clinton acted in order to enhance
``the psychological dimension of power'' against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Bill Clinton is a good and courageous leader, not a
liar and a bully. I mean, look at what nice ties he wears. &QL;

<P>
   One summer night in 1992, I interviewed Sudan's President Omar
el-Bashir in the mud fortress in Khartoum that passes for a
``presidential palace.'' It was guarded by dozens of Islamic
boy-soldiers with automatic weapons and faulty walkie-talkies. One
was so defective that it almost got my Sudanese escort and I shot
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When their officer couldn't raise the security staff inside, two
soldiers suddenly dropped to their knees in the glare of our
headlamps. I stared through the windscreen for minutes at their
knuckles on the triggers, until my Sudanese friend persuaded them
to borrow his own mobile phone. Finally, we were waved through the
gate into a dark medieval casbah.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after the cruise missiles hit Khartoum, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, said that the
destroyed factory was part of Sudan's military-industrial complex.
That's an audacious piece of spin.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week in the heart of Sudan's ``military-industrial
complex,'' with its malarial mosquitoes, streets covered in sand
and relics of Britain's colonial rule.

HIKE THE GREAT WALL, OR FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE FORBIDDEN CITY

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't need friends in Beijing to hike the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Travel services based in the United States can book tours
customized to include a hike led by a bilingual guide, said Gerry
Kerr, a spokesman for the Florida-based Pacific Delight Tours.
</P>
<P>
   A weeklong tour of Beijing, including a two-day hike, would cost
about $1,200 between March and mid-November, and a little less
during inclement periods between November and February. That
includes round-trip air fare, hotel, breakfast each day, a few
dinners and sightseeing in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The wall hike wgumd be tailored to suit the individual, Kerr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the China trip would include sightseeing at the
Forbidden City, the Ming Tombs and the Temple of Heaven. For more
information, contact Pacific Delight Tours at (800) 221-7179.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can scare up a tour on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Although the more developed parts of the Great Wall at Badaling
and Mutanyu have regular bus service, few go to Simatai, about
three hours from Beijing. The bus to Simatai departs Dongzhimen bus
station once a day at 7 a.m. and returns about 3 p.m. The cost is
about $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the wall on your own, try the Jinghua Hotel. A
favorite of backpackers, it offers a tour for about $8.30. The
booking office number is 011-86-10-6-7222211.
</P>
<P>
   Great Wall tours leave from Tiananmen Square regularly, but be
careful. They tend to ask exorbitant prices of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   For more on the wall, pick up a copy of William Lindesay's
``Alone on the Great Wall,'' Fulcrum Publishing, 1991.

 By JIM WALLIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    All of a sudden we are at war, with an enemy few of us
understand. The U.S. government is telling us that we have entered
a new conflict, one that may last for years, even decades.
 &HT;    If that is so, we are beginning with the wrong strategy.
 &HT;    Let's be clear: There is never any justification or even
explanation for the kind of terrorism we recently witnessed at the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The world is full of
grievances, real and imagined.
 &HT;    But the taking of innocent life in response to those grievances
is never morally acceptable. Never.
 &HT;    Terrorists, by definition, always seek extreme solutions. And
Islamic extremists who have perpetrated terrorist violence always
appeal to deeply held Arab resentments and grievances.
 &HT;    They view the American military presence in Saudi Arabia as a
religious offense to the sacred sites of Islam. They regard the
United States as the primary backer of Israel that refuses to
demand that the Israeli government accommodate Palestinian rights
and comply with the Oslo peace accords.
 &HT;    They regard the United States as an ally of unpopular Arab
regimes and the support base for repressive, oil-rich Gulf states.
 &HT;    Finally, terrorist networks represented by people like Osama bin
Laden envision a Muslim theocracy forcibly uniting the Islamic
world, imposing its strict religious regime on the entire region,
and consolidating Middle East oil reserves.
 &HT;    That's a frightening vision for the people of the Middle East as
well as the rest of us, and it is at odds with the true principles
of Islam.
 &HT;    The question is, what is the most appropriate and effective
response? The United States has decided on a unilateral military
strategy to counter such terrorism and, indeed, go on the
offensive. That is a moral and political mistake.
 &HT;    Cruise missiles have never been effective against terrorism.
Seventy-five or more were used in Sudan and Afghanistan, inflicting
``moderate to heavy'' damage. That's many more than the number of
terrorists killed or pharmaceutical companies destroyed. Can we
afford to build a cruise missile for every terrorist?
 &HT;    Military responses generally have not been effective in
combating terrorism. The full force of the Soviet army was unable
to defeat the guerrillas bunkered down in the mountains of
Afghanistan.
 &HT;    Why do we think the United States can be successful in defeating
the same people now become anti-American terrorists? Where has a
purely military strategy worked?
 &HT;    On the contrary, if Osama bin Laden was indeed responsible for
the terror in Africa and elsewhere, these U.S. strikes have made
him an international household word and conferred on him a status
he might never have achieved otherwise.
 &HT;    Already, more angry Muslim youth are murmuring his name in
reverence and are being attracted to his cause.
 &HT;    Because this terrorism is more theological than ideological, it
poses the real danger of a perceived confrontation between the
primarily Christian West and Islamic fundamentalism. There is
profound misunderstanding between Christians and Muslims, which
underlines the potential for conflict, even though the mainstream
of each religion does not want it.
 &HT;    Terrorism could become the new enemy that we have lacked since
the fall of communism, bringing the needed excuses for more
military build-ups and weapons systems, more simplifying of
complicated realities, more means-justifies-the-ends thinking and
acting, and more violent conflict.
 &HT;    That conflict would likely continue to escalate with one strike
countering another, each one putting more and more people --
especially civilians -- at greater risk.
 &HT;    With more strikes against U.S. citizens, the public clamor for
more counterstrikes will grow; and with more U.S. counterstrikes
the demand for more retaliation from the aggrieved parties in the
Middle East will increase. With casualties on both sides growing,
the perpetrators of the violence will both be accused of terrorism.
 &HT;    The prospect of the introduction of weapons of mass destruction
is too terrible to contemplate. But we must.
 &HT;    There is a better way. The best way to counter terrorism is to
isolate the perpetrators and decrease their public support by
taking the wind out of their sails and the energy out of their
cause.
 &HT;    That means, first of all, the United States must be much tougher
on the present Israeli government until it honors the peace
agreements from Oslo. That is much more difficult politically than
launching cruise missiles, but it is a course more likely to
produce results. At the absolute heart of Middle East conflict is
the crucial need for an Israeli/Palestinian peace and security
settlement. Progress in other areas will flow from that.
 &HT;    The United States must cease its double standards in the Middle
East, honoring some U.N. resolutions and ignoring others. That
perceived double standard is at the center of Arab grievances.
 &HT;    The United States must also support democratic reform in the
Middle East, especially among its oil-rich and repressive Arab
allies in the region. A more democratic region would require less
American military presence, high on the list of things that insult
many Arabs.
 &HT;    The U.S. government must commit to genuinely international
solutions to problems like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. This
will not be easy. It will mean strengthening the international
institutions and rule of law that the United States often seeks to
keep weak to preserve its super-power prerogatives. And it will
require a commitment to real multi-lateral action, especially in
the Middle East, when unilateral U.S. action has often been
preferred.
 &HT;    And a whole new effort, perhaps sparked by American religious
leaders, must be undertaken to increase understanding for Islam.
Conflict resolution could be undertaken by religious leaders across
political lines who have learned to trust and respect each other.
The American public must learn not to equate the words ``Islam''
and ``Arab'' with terrorism.
 &HT;    We must not begin a new war against terrorism. Instead, we must
commit ourselves to a new strategy. Both religious and political
wisdom suggest a different course than the one just embarked upon
by the Clinton Administration.
 &HT;    It is not too late to re-examine that course.

 &HT;    DEAF YOUTH SAYS PROMISES OF BETTER LIFE BACK IN MEXICO
UNFULFILLED
 &HT;    With photos, and copy of letter placed in the International
folder on the Cox Server.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ He signed his words furiously, eager to tell his
story and break through the silence that envelopes his life.
</P>
<P>
   Braulio David Infante, a 20-year-old deaf-mute, described
through an interpreter and writing why he left Mexico City and
embarked on a journey that took him secretly into California, New
York, Chicago and the American South.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a circle of deaf-mutes who were exploited by their
Mexican ring leaders, Infante sold key chains on subways and at
shopping malls -- until he was discovered last year and voluntarily
deported from Atlanta back to Mexico in October. Mexican
authorities promised him and the other deaf-mutes a better life
than the one he'd left.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly a year later, Infante said, nothing is better. Before
he left Mexico, he doubted he'd ever have the chance to fulfill his
dream of becoming college-educated. There wasn't even a public high
school for him to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, those barriers still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels as if he were deceived by coming back,'' an
interpreter said, while Infante, reading lips, nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after Infante and other Mexican deaf-mutes were
discovered in semi-captivity in North Carolina, New York, Chicago
and other U.S. cities, Mexico is still struggling with how to best
serve its deaf and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   For poor families like Infante's, life can be especially harsh.
Mexico has no public high school for the deaf. Although the country
has boosted job-training programs and is attempting to integrate
disabled children into regular schools, it offers few services --
such as sign-language interpreters -- who would make attending
ordinary high school possible.
</P>
<P>
   Infante's family, which lives in a tiny cement-floor apartment
in a tough section of this city, has long believed education is key
to overcoming a life confined to menial, low-paid labor. In the
family's home, a book shelf is lined with encyclopedias and ``how
to'' books that Infante's deaf mother bought for her two deaf sons.
</P>
<P>
   Infante devoured the books, but he was only able to complete the
equivalent of junior high school. When he tried to attend a public
high school teachers offered no help and his family was too poor to
hire a private interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Infante's 13-year-old brother, Jose appears doomed to a limited
education as well, said Tomas Infante, the boys' father. Tomas is
not deaf, but he is hearing-impaired and only makes about $50 every
two weeks as a janitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braulio is very smart,'' Tomas said. ``He wants to get ahead,
so he doesn't have to do work like me and earn so little.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Marshall Cohen, who represented Infante and other
deaf-mutes after they were found in Sanford, N.C., agrees that
Infante is ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   After only a few months in the United States, Infante began to
learn American Sign Language and realized that American deaf people
have more access to higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we met with the Mexican Consulate (in Atlanta) he
would always ask if there was a way he could get into school,''
Cohen said. ``I think he saw his time here as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has grown increasingly concerned about Infante, who has
conveyed E-mail messages to him in English about his futile
attempts to pursue an education and obtain a job in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Infante befriended a Spanish-speaking American who is studying
Mexico's sign language, and asked her to translate the E-mail and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   In a March letter to Deaf Friend International in Hamilton,
Ohio, he asked for help finding an American high school for the
deaf, where he could begin studying to become an interpreter of
American and Mexican sign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Without a U.S. visa or financial support, however, Infante would
not be able to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While Infante was in Atlanta last fall, Mexico's family
development agency, known by the acronym DIF, had promised to help
the deaf-mutes once they returned voluntarily to Mexico, Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Infante said he's been turned down for jobs at restaurants
and other workplaces because he is deaf. When he went to the DIF
for help he was treated as if he were mentally impaired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made him play diagnostic games with shapes and colors,
And he told them, 'I'm not a fool. These are games for children,'''
an interpreter said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Consul Hugo Juarez of the Mexican Consulate in Atlanta
agreed that Infante is ``exceptional,'' and could do well in higher
education. Many of the Mexican deaf-mutes who were in the United
States were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Juarez and Cohen thought they would be able to get Infante
into a U.S. school. But his family didn't have money to support
him. And he -- like the other deaf-mutes found in North Carolina --
was not offered a visa to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the case of the deaf-mutes in Atlanta was very
different from those in New York,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a large group of abused deaf-mutes in New York, 37 opted
to accept special U.S. residency visas offered by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service in exchange for assisting in the
prosecution of several ring leaders. No such deal was offered to
the deaf-mutes there in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The New York ring leaders have been sentenced to between two and
14 years in prison for smuggling and abusing the deaf-mutes.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, two ring leaders received sentences of
between 41 and 46 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another 17 deaf-mutes who were in New York chose to return to
Mexico in July of this year amid more promises of help from the
Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the plight of the deaf-mutes, Mexico has paid
more attention to its disabled over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, President Ernesto Zedillo met with activists to talk
about the country's integration program for the disabled. In the
last two years, he said, Mexico has seen a 400 percent increase in
the number of educational support teams for the disabled in regular
schools.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Mexico increased a scholarship program for
training unemployed disabled persons by 36 percent in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Democratic Revolution Party announced on
Aug. 24 that they will consider proposed constitutional amendments
to expand guarantees for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we have a culture that pays more attention to the
disabled,'' said Ricardo Camacho, DIF's director of rehabilitation,
which is involved in resettling the deaf-mutes.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted ``there is lots more to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about Infante's troubles, Camacho said he was
willing to meet with the youth personally to see if he could
qualify for a job-training grant or perhaps even find him an
appropriate school.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that public high schools remain out of reach
for most of the deaf who are poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Vice Consul Juarez said, ``It makes us very sad. We
became very fond of the deaf-mutes. We did what we could for them
here. Now, as they say here, the ball is another court.''

 &HT;    IN OLD-STYLE COMMUNIST BELARUS, CENSORS PUSH 'PINOCCHIO' OFF

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''
</P>

Wyborcza,'' a leading Polish newspaper published in Warsaw and
other Polish cities.)

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.

<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

   MINSK, Belarus _ The Soviet Union has collapsed and the Moscow
nights swing nowadays, but back here in Minsk old communist-style
think is still the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of ``Pinocchio.'' The Belorussian version of the
traditional puppet show for children was yanked off the Minsk stage
not long ago when critics saw too many allusions to the current
nasty political scene in the play.
</P>
<P>
   How could a mere children's show cause so much offense in this
dictator-run land? That's easy. To begin with, Ales Surau, the set
designer, dressed the wooden ``actors'' in contemporary quilted
jackets, Russian workers' caps and workers' rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   That act alone aroused the ire of the nation's critics. ``The
peasants look like criminals. I was at a collective farm not long
ago and I saw people there who were very well-dressed,'' one them
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinocchio,'' or ``Lipawiczki,'' as the Belorussian version is
known, had been a big hit when it played earlier this year at the
Puppet Theater in Grodno, a provincial center that's a lot less
uptight than this rigid capital -- which is under the all-watchful
eye of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   But when the play was shifted from Grodno to the Creative
Laboratory in the Puppet Theater here, located across from the
residence of the president, nothing apparently went right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole circle of critics came to see it,'' Surau, the
designer, recalled. ``But when they gathered there, they went into
shock. What had made people laugh in Grodno caused fear in the
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for the puppets, Surau designed a three-foot
garland that bore a striking resemblance to the new Belorussian
national emblem -- a Lukashenko creation that the president had
made to replace the historical version.
</P>
<P>
   Surau added what he called ``a creative modification'' to the
new post-Soviet emblem. His garland consisted of fake bananas,
coconuts, pineapples and green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stress the idyllic character and agricultural
significance of the performance,'' Surau said with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   To further his rather mild anti-government parody, in the center
of the garland he placed a globe. And in the center of the globe he
painted a tractor, built by the state tractor factory and known as
``The Belorussia.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractor occupied the exact spot on the map where Minsk
should have been. And on the left side of the map was another
perceived slight: a small Catholic Church in the place of his home
town of Grodno.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the insults against the official line, the walls of
the stage were covered with the presidential newspaper ``Sovietska
Belarus,'' instead of ordinary wallpaper. And in the ``windows''
there were border posts, painted in red and green stripes, where
the actual action of the play took place.
</P>
<P>
   The performance consisted of two plots -- a play within a play.
</P>
<P>
   One plot line followed the traditional battle between good and
evil, as the wooden boy brought joy to the hearts of his father and
fought off evil in the form devilish cats. The other plot focused
on the life of a present-day Belorussian family who had lived for
70 years on a collective farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall of the peasant hut hung a very simple radio,''
Surau said, one which could tune in only one station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic object of equipment in every village home,''
he pointedly noted. ``A few times during the play the national
anthem resounded from the radio. This same one which awakens people
every day at six in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were indignant that we had insulted the national
anthem. But it was really they who actually insulted it because
when they watched the performance, they never once stood up. When I
reminded them of this, they began to shout: 'You can't order us
when to stand up.'''
</P>
<P>
   The loyal critics also went ballistic over another scene that
they thought insulted Lukashenko. It depicted a peasant on the
collective farm reading the ``Sovietska Belarus'' newspaper and
thinking out loud, ``Who is the most beautiful person in our
country?'' and answering ``It's well known who.''
</P>
<P>
   After the critics complained, officials ordered the play off the
stage, supposedly to be ``polished up.'' Although the Minsk
audiences, minus the critics, loved it, the play has yet to be
revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say whether we were dealing with critics or
censors, the outspoken Surau said. ``I guess they were critics who,
out of fear, took on the role of censors.''

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ For years, hawkers, panhandlers, drug
dealers, and prostitutes have been as much a part of the landscape
of this Caribbean island as coconut groves and jerk chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, a chorus of complaints from visitors has become so
deafening it's threatened to destroy the foundation on which
Jamaica's economy is built: tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce has come up with a
controversial solution to alleviate at least part of the problem:
legalize brothels so that red-light districts can be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' reasoned
Howard Hamilton, chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem here and I don't think we should hide our
heads in the sand,'' he said. ``I'm not advocating prostitution,
but it's out there and we should regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is by far Jamaica's most valuable industry, accounting
for 45 percent of its foreign exchange, for 13.7 percent of its
$6.2 billion gross domestic product (GDP), and for one in every
four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million visitors
last year, including 700,000 cruise ship passengers. About 60
percent came from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But harassment by overzealous prostitutes, drug dealers, taxi
drivers, hair braiders and curio vendors has taken its toll in a
country that has been hit hard over the last few years by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- losing dozens of foreign
businesses to lowered trade barriers between Canada, Mexico, and
the United States. After shrinking in both 1996 and 1997, Jamaica's
GDP is expected to do the same this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the stakes are so high for this country so bent
on protecting the new mainstay of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of tourists who visit other Caribbean countries
is expected to jump by a whopping 7 percent this year, the number
who visit Jamaica is expected to climb by a mere 1-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had three cruise ships come in here a week, but
this year we only have one a week,'' said Rijhu Jagwani, owner of
the Glad Rags store in Montego Bay. ``There's no question that
harassment has driven some tourists away, and this is hurting
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose that
lays the golden egg,'' warned Prime Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to refuse to come to Jamaica because of
harassment, resulting in a virtual collapse of the tourism industry
so that there'll be no jobs for anyone at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holland America and Celebrity cruise lines have pulled
out of Montego Bay, partly because travelers were reporting
discomfort during their stops there.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaica Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to Jamaica last year said they'd been harassed at some
point during their stays. Of that number, 60 percent had been asked
to buy drugs and 13 percent said the incidents had spoiled their
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has so far not commented on Hamilton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Patterson has initiated a government crackdown on
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs have gone up alongside many highways directed at Jamaicans
that say: ``Tourism Is Everyone's Business.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the penalties for first-time offenders who bother
tourists to buy or barter for drugs, sex and souvenirs were raised
100-fold, from $27 to $2,700. The penalties for repeat offenders
were increased from $41 to $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Night courts were established so that law-enforcement officers
can appear in court without having to abandon their beats.
</P>
<P>
   But while big fines might deter those with a legitimate business
who have a lot to lose, it's not clear how they will affect the
marginal players, the unemployed people trying to eke out a living
with few options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel McCook, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board,
concedes that it's not easy to haul violators before the courts on
charges of harassment or solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a sensitive issue because on one hand you want to
encourage visitors to interact with average Jamaicans so that they
learn about the culture, but on the other hand you don't want
visitors to feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least with red-light districts, Hamilton contends,
streetwalking prostitutes wouldn't be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's proposed that the government require medical
certification for the brothels and regular testing of the
prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the districts could be modeled after the aptly named
Campo Alegre, or Camp of Happiness -- the government-operated
red-light district in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   As a Dutch possession, prostitution is legal on that island and
is regulated by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Located on a hill near the airport, Campo Alegre resembles a
prison camp, and is guarded by policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Council of Churches has blasted Hamilton's proposal,
issuing a statement that instructs chamber members to ask
themselves whether they would recommend prostitution for their own
sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton argues that with unemployment already nearing 20
percent, drastic action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an economic situation in this country where people
are desperate to find jobs so of course they flock to the tourist
areas because it's the only place they can make money, but they're
scaring away the tourists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making people even more desperate is the rising popularity of
all-inclusive resorts. Tourists tend to tether themselves there and
not make themselves available to the hawkers and small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offering things are more assertive now,'' McCook said.
``The manner of selling has gotten more offensive.''

`GOVERNESS' MORE EYRE THAN POPPINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Governess'' cloaks viewers in an aura of Gothic mystery, as
its heroine, Rosina (Minnie Driver of ``Good Will Hunting``),
sweeps through gas-lit 19th-century London, and, later, the eerie
moonscape of Scotland's Isle of Skye.
</P>
<P>
   But the intrigue here is not of the first-wife-in-the-attic
variety. ``The Governess,'' directed and written by Sandra
Goldbacher, explores more human mysteries _ identity and the soul.
The film's dark and lustrous tones, its eroticism, the religious
rituals it observes but doesn't explain, and the occasional
dreamlike camera flourishes make something enthralling of a story
that could have been dryly observed.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina, a young Jewish woman, pretends to be a Christian,
calling herself Mary, to work as a governess to support her family
after her father dies. Charles Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson of ``The
Full Monty``), the head of the Scottish family for whom she works,
shuts himself up for long hours in a mysterious laboratory. A maid
whispers something about experiments in capturing shadows; we soon
discover it's actually rudimentary photography.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina's intellectual curiosity draws her through the
laboratory's doors, and to the side of Cavendish; eventually they
become lovers. The photographs are a way for Rosina to escape the
confines of her circumstances. Photography as an X-ray of the soul
is lyrically presented, one of the ways`` The Governess'' uses the
nuts-and-bolts of life to illuminate its abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina is a winning heroine, playful and confident, not a demure
gentlewoman in rustling skirts. Mary Poppins she's not. She
initially describes her charge, Clementina, as ``a rodent in lace
petticoats.'' (She is played by Florence Hoath of ``FairyTale: A
True Story,'' another movie in which photography's magical
properties figure.)
</P>
<P>
   The British actress Driver, with her broad face and throaty
voice, is alternately plain and beautiful. Her performance is rich;
her Oscar nomination for ``Good Will Hunting'' was definitely not a
fluke. The role is probably the most formidable display American
audiences have seen of Driver, who also had prominent roles in the
movies ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' and ``Big Night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's easy for a film made in the '90s but set in the
past to quickly win over audiences with such a character. All the
heroines of films such as ``Ever After'' and ``Sense and
Sensibility'' have to do is behave in a way considered
``unladylike'' for the setting, but admirable today; that is,
opinionated and passionate, tomboyish and robust. Rosina is thS?Bo
then some, and her complexity is one of the many detailed parts
that make ``The Governess'' such a beautiful whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess'' is rated R for nudity, sex and other adult
themes. By the way, it's one of the few films in which there's as
much male nudity as female. 4 stars. &QL;

IN NEW INDIE FILM, TEXANS LITERALLY STAND BY THEIR TRUCK
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A few years back, an aspiring screenwriter
named Robb Bindler walked out of a Longview, Texas, bar, astonished
to see bright lights blazing at a nearby Nissan dealership _ at 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, Bindler walked over to investigate, and found a bunch
of people standing with their hands on a fully loaded $15,000
pickup. They had been there for hours, and the last person to take
his or her hand off the pickup got to take it home. Silly stuff,
Bindler thought, and kinda boring. He watched for a half-hour, then
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Bindler's late-night adventure has evolved into
one of the best movies to play these parts in 1998. ``Hands on a
Hard Body,'' the first-time filmmaker's movie about the contest, is
a funny, fascinating and ultimately moving documentary about
competition, companionship, endurance and the importance of having
a pickup in Texas. The film opens locally Friday; there will even
be a ``Hands On'' contest beginning at 7 a.m. Friday at one
location, in which 20 people will compete for a $16,000 Nissan
Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Jack Long dealership in Longview sponsors a ``Hands On''
contest every year. Thousands of people register. Twenty-four
people are randomly chosen to stand with their hands on the truck,
with a five-minute break every hour and a 15-minute break every six
hours. Crouching and leaning are not allowed; the last one standing
wins. It takes days.
</P>
<P>
   When Bindler, now 28, and a friend returned to the dealership in
1995 with a couple of video cameras and microphones, he wasn't
planning a real movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to write a screenplay that was set in East Texas,
and I was going to use the contest as a vehicle _ no pun intended _
to explore some characters and themes that I had in mind,'' Bindler
says. But what was planned as a research documentary turned out to
be a pretty good story on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got really lucky,'' he says. ``We showed up, and characters
emerged, and themes emerged, and drama and comedy and conflict and
everything just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   When describing ``Hands,'' it's hard not to lose things in
translation. Characters do emerge _ most notably, Benny Perkins, a
former winner cocky enough to believe he can do it again; Norma
Valverde, a deeply religious woman who sings hymns during the
contest to stay awake (she believes victory is ordained by God);
and Kelli Mangrum, who wants to win the truck so she can sell it,
pay bills and quit one of her two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bindler concedes that the movie risks condescension, especially
with some unintentionally funny comments the contestants make in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in thinking that this thing was just a goofy,
ridiculous Texas slice of Americana, yeah, but crazy Americana,''
he says. ``Hopefully, in the process of watching the film, the
audience will go through what we went through on the set, which was
a subtle transformation from laughing at, to laughing with, to a
catharsis, to really caring about the people who are involved in
this event for one reason or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting an audience to see it was the hard part. The initial
cost _ $10,000 _ was inexpensive by film standards. But Bindler
needed money to get the movie transferred from video to film and
for multiple prints so that it could play the festival circuit.
That's where actor Matthew McConaughey came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew and I grew up together in Longview,'' Bindler says.
``That's how I know him. I called McConaughey and told him I needed
some money, to write me a check, and he said `How much?' and I told
him, and he wrote me a check, and that was his involvement.''
Bindler is reticent about the film's total cost, and McConaughey
was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands'' started on the festival circuit in Santa Barbara in
1997, and its reputation began to grow. It won the audience award
at the GenArt Film Festival in New York. The Village Voice gave it
extensive coverage. The Hollywood Reporter featured it in a special
edition on marketing movies.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, ``Hands'' played the Austin Film Festival, where it
was a huge hit and caught filmmaker Richard Linklater's attention.
Linklater brought it back to Austin recently as part of an Austin
Film Society documentary series.
</P>
<P>
   Linklater ``put it to the audience in terms of, `If you like
this film, go out and tell your friends about it, because we have
the responsibility and the opportunity to make this film work, to
get it out there in the nation through wider distribution,' ''
Bindler says. The word got out: The movie has played in Austin for
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It has even played in Longview, where Bindler grew up hanging
out in a movie theater and watching HBO and Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contestants hadn't seen the film, so I was freaking out,''
Bindler says. ``To sit in the theater with them as they watched
themselves was a really powerful experience. It was very
worthwhile; they loved the film.''

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, straight after his testimony to the grand jury in
the matter of Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton took a gamble. It may
turn out to be the biggest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled that being found to have told lies about a sexual
fling does not merit a real apology.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that Americans believe his private behavior is his
own business and nobody else's. And he presumed that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has nothing more substantial to
pin on him.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for watching, and good night.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of this gamble may not be clear even to the president
himself. It was presumably based, like everything else in this
media-struck presidency, on a close study of the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that most Americans have long considered him an
undeserving victim of Starr's investigation, Clinton spoke against
a backdrop that was understated, even funereal, and without any of
the flags and drapes that usually proclaim the authority of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who is put-upon, not powerful. And since most
Americans have also said that the president's affair with Lewinsky
is a private matter, Clinton spent his fiercest moments defending
his right to a private life and lambasting Starr for his ``prying''
and ``personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no Richard Nixon, hunched and grey, trying to hold back
the almost palpable hatred of the public; it was a vigorous and
defiant performance. But what Clinton said was not good enough, and
it will not be the end of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   As the president well knows, sex was not the issue. Starr is
looking into obstruction of justice and suborning to perjury, and
here the polls have always shown considerable public unease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may well have perjured himself by denying the affair in
his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones case; and perjury is
perjury, even in a civil suit, and even in a case that has since
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   His ``legally accurate'' denials, and his hairline distinctions
about perjury, made in his broadcast, did him no favors; they
suggest a man who will not hesitate to wriggle out of charges on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now exposed the president's habit of lying. Clinton
had denied his affair on television: emphatically, pointing his
finger, and looking his countrymen in the eye. Having done that, he
allowed _ nay, encouraged _ his wife, his aides and even his
cabinet to repeat the lie.
</P>
<P>
   In his address of Aug. 17, he assured Americans categorically
that ``at no time did I ask anyone to lie.'' That too may be
``legally accurate.'' Politically, it could prove a ticking time
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his ``false impression,'' he explained, to shield
himself from embarrassment and to protect his family. The
implication is that any ordinary American male would have done the
same. It is his private business.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Presidents deserve their privacy, but this
does not mean, as it used to, that reckless immorality should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents know full well that the popular trust depends
on their private, as well as their public, behavior. Clinton should
know it better than most; he salvaged his own presidential campaign
in 1992 by confessing to troubles in his marriage and suggesting
that he would amend them.
</P>
<P>
   And is presidential lying, which stalls not only a judicial
inquiry but also the day-to-day running of the country and even its
effectiveness abroad, really a private matter?
</P>
<P>
   The impulses behind it may be human and ordinary, but the
effects are not. It was the lying that needed _ and did not get _ a
proper, heartfelt apology from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that other presidents have been caught out in bigger
lies, and have been forgiven. Eisenhower refused to acknowledge _
until Khrushchev rubbed his nose in it _ that American spy planes
were flying over Russia; Ronald Reagan denied, against all the
evidence, that arms had been traded for hostages in Iran. Both
men's popularity barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with job-approval ratings as high as Reagan's and an
economy as buoyant as Eisenhower's, may well feel he has an equal
chance of absolution. Yet his pattern of philandering and lying
means that his stock of trust and respect is already dangerously
low.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that almost no one wants to impeach him. But nor can
they believe in his moral authority. Without that, it is hard to
see how a president can function. Without that, as this paper has
said before, it would be better if he would go, to make way for
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is not Clinton's plan. His best hope must now be
that nothing more emerges.
</P>
<P>
   This gamble is not entirely foolish. Starr has been slow in
gathering his evidence, to the point where it will have to be
startling indeed to make Americans care, or to stimulate Congress
into launching impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he may yet turn out to have much more than Clinton supposes.
The president's admission of his affair showed that Starr, contrary
to expectations, had quite enough evidence to prove the Lewinsky
relationship beyond a shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thoroughness colors his broader inquiry, into
patterns of corruption and obstruction of justice, Clinton will be
in much deeper trouble. As indeed he will be if he is shown to have
told further lies during his four-minute TV address or his
four-hour grand-jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The burden is squarely on Starr. Until that infamous four-minute
broadcast, the tedious prolongation of the inquiry could be blamed
on Clinton's stonewalling. Now that blockage is removed, the
independent counsel must quickly produce what he has, or shut up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiance should be a goad to him: there are now
new-minted denials to refute. The president himself has raised the
stakes, and has gambled on keeping public opinion behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that he may indeed have retained it, but
that it is brittle and distrustful. The image that may well linger
in the public mind is not of contrition, but of braggadocio in the
face of a net that is inexorably closing in. &QL;

`54` SOUND TRACK CRANKS IT UP FOR TRUE DISCO FANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Good news for unrepentant fans of disco music (all
three of you): ``54'' gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   This is not ``The Last Days of Disco,'' the artsy Whit Stillman
film released earlier this year that buried a solid-gold soundtrack
beneath the whiny self-absorption of Manhattan yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``54'' has the good sense to crank it up, right from the
start. Thelma Houston's sizzling, Philly-flavored ``Don't Leave Me
This Way'' announces during the opening credits that whatever this
movie's failings, its treatment of the music won't be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you were into disco _ really into it, not just trying it on
for size like most people _ then the two-CD soundtrack to ``54'' is
a must for the collection. Check out the thumping bass, blaring
horns and soaring strings that were trademarks of the most reviled
(yet secretly admired) pop music of the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the more obscure ``Last Days'' film had a more
commercial soundtrack, with familiar songs such as ``Love Train,``
``Got to Be Real,'' ``Good Times'' and ``More, More, More'' _ hits
from the era that were carried by radio to all corners of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Days'' was full of the mainstream dance music that
brought 15-minute fame to Donna Summer, the Village People, and KC
and the Sunshine Band. It's just too bad Stillman made a film about
talking instead of dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Christopher's high-gloss direction gives ``54'' more of a
disco connoisseur's feel, and the songs complement that. In fact,
Studio 54 was instrumental to the success of recording acts of the
day, most notably Gloria (``I Will Survive'') Gaynor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to hear ``The Hustle'' one more time? This isn't your
movie. Of the 30 vintage songs on ``54's'' two discs, almost half
never made the ``Billboard'' Top 40. And although three of the
recording acts represented _ Chic, Diana Ross and Rose Royce _ had
No. 1 disco hits, you won't find those hits here. Less-prominent
songs by the three were chosen instead.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Convention's lyrically challenged ``Fly Robin Fly'' and
three other No. 1 hits made the soundtrack, but there are songs by
such virtual unknowns as Brainstorm, GQ, Grace Jones, Sylvester and
Destination.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Starr, whose big hit for Motown was the protest song
``War,'' sings ``Contact,'' a funky tune that never charted. And
the group War, of ``Low Rider'' and ``Cisco Kid'' fame, contributes
``Galaxy,'' also merely a blip on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, then, this is music best appreciated by those who
danced their nights away in urban clubs. For those whose disco
memory begins and ends with the ``Saturday Night Fever''
soundtrack, ``54'' might not hold much interest.``
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, where else will you hear a discofied version
of Gordon Lightfoot's ``If You Could Read My Mind''? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, straight after his testimony to the grand jury in
the matter of Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton took a gamble. It may
turn out to be the biggest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He gambled that being found to have told lies about a sexual
fling does not merit a real apology.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that Americans believe his private behavior is his
own business and nobody else's. And he presumed that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has nothing more substantial to
pin on him.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for watching, and good night.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of this gamble may not be clear even to the president
himself. It was presumably based, like everything else in this
media-struck presidency, on a close study of the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that most Americans have long considered him an
undeserving victim of Starr's investigation, Clinton spoke against
a backdrop that was understated, even funereal, and without any of
the flags and drapes that usually proclaim the authority of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who is put-upon, not powerful. And since most
Americans have also said that the president's affair with Lewinsky
is a private matter, Clinton spent his fiercest moments defending
his right to a private life and lambasting Starr for his ``prying''
and ``personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no Richard Nixon, hunched and grey, trying to hold back
the almost palpable hatred of the public; it was a vigorous and
defiant performance. But what Clinton said was not good enough, and
it will not be the end of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   As the president well knows, sex was not the issue. Starr is
looking into obstruction of justice and suborning to perjury, and
here the polls have always shown considerable public unease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may well have perjured himself by denying the affair in
his sworn deposition in the Paula Jones case; and perjury is
perjury, even in a civil suit, and even in a case that has since
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   His ``legally accurate'' denials, and his hairline distinctions
about perjury, made in his broadcast, did him no favors; they
suggest a man who will not hesitate to wriggle out of charges on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now exposed the president's habit of lying. Clinton
had denied his affair on television: emphatically, pointing his
finger, and looking his countrymen in the eye. Having done that, he
allowed _ nay, encouraged _ his wife, his aides and even his
cabinet to repeat the lie.
</P>
<P>
   In his address of Aug. 17, he assured Americans categorically
that ``at no time did I ask anyone to lie.'' That too may be
``legally accurate.'' Politically, it could prove a ticking time
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his ``false impression,'' he explained, to shield
himself from embarrassment and to protect his family. The
implication is that any ordinary American male would have done the
same. It is his private business.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Presidents deserve their privacy, but this
does not mean, as it used to, that reckless immorality should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Modern presidents know full well that the popular trust depends
on their private, as well as their public, behavior. Clinton should
know it better than most; he salvaged his own presidential campaign
in 1992 by confessing to troubles in his marriage and suggesting
that he would amend them.
</P>
<P>
   And is presidential lying, which stalls not only a judicial
inquiry but also the day-to-day running of the country and even its
effectiveness abroad, really a private matter?
</P>
<P>
   The impulses behind it may be human and ordinary, but the
effects are not. It was the lying that needed _ and did not get _ a
proper, heartfelt apology from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that other presidents have been caught out in bigger
lies, and have been forgiven. Eisenhower refused to acknowledge _
until Khrushchev rubbed his nose in it _ that American spy planes
were flying over Russia; Ronald Reagan denied, against all the
evidence, that arms had been traded for hostages in Iran. Both
men's popularity barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with job-approval ratings as high as Reagan's and an
economy as buoyant as Eisenhower's, may well feel he has an equal
chance of absolution. Yet his pattern of philandering and lying
means that his stock of trust and respect is already dangerously
low.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain that almost no one wants to impeach him. But nor can
they believe in his moral authority. Without that, it is hard to
see how a president can function. Without that, as this paper has
said before, it would be better if he would go, to make way for
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that is not Clinton's plan. His best hope must now be
that nothing more emerges.
</P>
<P>
   This gamble is not entirely foolish. Starr has been slow in
gathering his evidence, to the point where it will have to be
startling indeed to make Americans care, or to stimulate Congress
into launching impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he may yet turn out to have much more than Clinton supposes.
The president's admission of his affair showed that Starr, contrary
to expectations, had quite enough evidence to prove the Lewinsky
relationship beyond a shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thoroughness colors his broader inquiry, into
patterns of corruption and obstruction of justice, Clinton will be
in much deeper trouble. As indeed he will be if he is shown to have
told further lies during his four-minute TV address or his
four-hour grand-jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The burden is squarely on Starr. Until that infamous four-minute
broadcast, the tedious prolongation of the inquiry could be blamed
on Clinton's stonewalling. Now that blockage is removed, the
independent counsel must quickly produce what he has, or shut up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defiance should be a goad to him: there are now
new-minted denials to refute. The president himself has raised the
stakes, and has gambled on keeping public opinion behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that he may indeed have retained it, but
that it is brittle and distrustful. The image that may well linger
in the public mind is not of contrition, but of braggadocio in the
face of a net that is inexorably closing in. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial part of the U.S. innovation system is the ready
availability of venture capital to back startup companies in
high-tech fields. The venture markets have been roaring in recent
years _ pouring private money into fledging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent data from a variety of sources show that 1997 was a
banner year for new private investment, particularly in information
technology companies _ and that 1998 looks like another winner.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, says Pat Gray, a managing partner at Price
Waterhouse, are particularly ``heartening'' because they point to
investments in a diverse mix of businesses and for companies at
different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   Investment growth, he says, ``was pretty broad-based, except in
biotech. Software and communications hit the cover off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   These optimistic sentiments are based on numbers from several
sources. Price Waterhouse, the New York-based consulting firm, says
venture capital investments climbed to $12.8 billion in 1997, up 34
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers show that most of the money _ about $8.5
billion _ went to high-tech businesses, such as Internet services,
software companies, and computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that track venture investments paint a similar
picture. Private investments have nearly doubled during the past
three years, says Rolf Selvig, director of business development at
San Francisco-based VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   If private investment is a crucial part of the innovation
system, so is the next step in the process: the initial public
offerings (IPOs) that bring public money into the startups. And
there the picture isn't quite so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs for venture-backed companies slowed dramatically in 1997.
After a record year in 1996, the number of IPOs for startups
dropped 41 percent in 1997 and the amount of money raised plummeted
by 43 percent to $5.4 billion, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slowdown in IPO markets, there's lots of
venture money available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says, Clinton Harris, an investment advisor at Grove
Street Advisors in Lexington, Mass., for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists, ``it's a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris raises a cautionary note. ``If you're an
investor it may be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes the danger is that the success rate of
venture-backed companies will drop. While the supply of money is
growing, he says, ``the availability of high-quality investments is
not changing as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the natural lag time in venture markets, says
Harris, ``if there is too much money now, it will still be two to
three years before the returns drop.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it looks as though the venture capital cog in
the innovation system is turning at a high rate. &QL;

<P>
   Remember monorail? That Jetson-era relic, one step above an
amusement park ride, zipping around airports, hotels, and yes,
amusement parks?
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment in the 1960s, monorail _ cars or trains
running on or under a single, elevated guide rail _ looked like the
future of mass transit. But that bright vision was eclipsed by a
surge of highway building and, more recently, the rush to build
urban light-rail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Monorail was written off as a novelty, fine for Disneyland but
hardly a serious option.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday's dreams are today's leaps forward. Thanks partly
to technological improvements, partly to new recognition of the
limitations of conventional rail, and especially to the grass-roots
activism of impatient citizens, monorail is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Today, space-short Japan leads the world in elevated transit,
with eight urban monorails. Sydney, Vancouver, and Singapore all
use monorails, as do planned communities in Brazil and parks in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Now monorail boosters in several U.S. cities are vying to make
their towns next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, those boosters recently attempted to persuade
transit officials to build a monorail in place of a controversial
planned light-rail system, on the ground that light rail would eat
too many precious street lanes.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed, but monorail boosters have made more headway
with the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council, which has proposed
a new light-rail system for the Cincinnati metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Vexed because light-rail vehicles can't handle the grade to the
regional airport on their side of the Ohio River, residents of
Covington, Ky., are pressing for a switch to monorail, whose rubber
tires and enclosed guideways provide better traction than
steel-wheeled light-rail vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They've persuaded their congressman, Jim Bunning, to arrange
federal funding to study the monorail option.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Seattle, home of the mile-long monorail left from the
1962 World's Fair, that has given the technology its broadest
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Seattle voters approved a 42-mile monorail system
running to all four corners of the city, over the opposition of
city officials and the business establishment, who favored light
rail and buses.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure was an unusual exercise in do-it-yourself
transit planning, drafted and promoted by an activist/cab driver,
Dick Falkenbury, who says he got the idea while ``stuck in traffic,
watching the monorail zip by overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get out of traffic, you're still stuck in traffic,''
Falkenbury explains. ``Once you realize that, only monorail makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most U.S. monorails are at theme parks and other
private venues only proves the technology's efficiency, he insist:
``When you build with other people's (i.e., public) money, you
build light rail. When you build with your own money, you build a
monorail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even monorail's critics concede that, because it weighs less, it
can be elevated less expensively than rail. Elevated systems can be
built quickly; because they needn't tango with traffic and
pedestrians, they can be automated, eliminating the driver salaries
that are conventional transit's biggest operating expense. (The
other way to get trains out of traffic's way, digging tunnels, is
prohibitively expensive _ as Los Angeles is discovering.)
</P>
<P>
   Though view-sensitive residents squirm at the thought of a
monorail's elevated guideways blocking their light, today's
guideways are much thinner than 1962's concrete behemoths. And
their pillars are spaced more widely _ 100-plus feet apart in a
leading model from Montreal-based monorail maker Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   Technical improvements have also obviated another longtime
monorail shortcoming: awkward switching from one track to another.
Bombardier can now switch tracks in 8 to 12 seconds, making
multi-track systems feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop with a conventional, mass-transit monorail?
University of Washington engineering professor emeritus Jerry
Schneider notes that Seattle's Monorail Initiative would allow the
city to implement a truly revolutionary solution: personal rapid
transit (PRT).
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the 1970s and now being revived on three
continents, PRT offers individualized, point-to-point service in
private (say, four-seater) cars running on lightweight,
computer-controlled, elevated guideways _ usually monorails but
sometimes dual rails.
</P>
<P>
   Variously dubbed ``automated taxis,'' ``horizontal elevator,''
or ``personal monorail,'' it's the only transit form that just
might match the automobile's convenience, without its environmental
downside.
</P>
<P>
   The monorail of the future may surprise even its present-day
proponents. &QL;

<P>
   After airline passengers walked through the metal detectors at
Albuquerque airport last fall, some volunteered to be scrutinized
one more time by a device that ``sniffed'' them to detect chemical
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they stepped into a portal about the size of two
shower stalls, where nozzles puffed jets of air from their
shoulders to their knees. A few seconds later, a computer screen
handed down the verdict: ``clean'' or ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosives-detection portal worked so well that researchers
at Sandia National Laboratories, who developed the device with
funding from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are now
seeking partners to commercialize it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave the researchers $2 million three years ago to
develop a way to ferret out people who are carrying or have
recently handled chemical explosives _ including so-called plastic
explosives _ which conventional methods cannot detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to cover any and all possible ways an explosive
could get on a plane,'' explains Paul Jankowski, manager of the
FAA's trace detection program, inaugurated in 1992 to stay a
technological step ahead of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The device is based on technology Sandia scientists developed to
protect nuclear weapons facilities from bomb threats and to prevent
people inside the facilities from smuggling out restricted chemical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   It sprays several cubic feet of air over a person's hands and
clothes to dislodge any chemicals adhering to them. The air is
sucked into a device below the traveler's feet and passes through a
chemical sensor called an ion mobility spectrometer that can
identify the chemical signatures of many different types of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity and type of chemicals detected then appear on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Sandia's research team was to develop the
preconcentrator technology _ the part of the device that aggregates
the air molecules quickly enough so that the ion spectrometer can
analyze them.
</P>
<P>
   The team succeeded so well that the device can detect very small
concentrations of all ``explosives of interest'' to the FAA,
according to project leader Kevin Linker, a mechanical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, given the task at hand, neither Sandia nor the FAA
will reveal what types of explosives the device detects or its
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial test, on 2,500 volunteers, worked well,
members of the research team say the process _ at 12 seconds per
customer _ still takes too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is 6 to 10 seconds,'' says chemical engineer Chuck
Rhykerd. ``That's the current speed of metal detectors. It doesn't
seem that long, but once you take your keys out of your pocket, put
your bags on the conveyor belt, walk through slowly, and pick up
your bags, that's how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the speed will be a challenge, he admits. ``Five
seconds to collect the air. Five seconds to do the analysis. We can
probably cut the analysis time by one to two seconds. But cutting
the sample time may reduce the device's sensitivity. It's a
trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another glitch that researchers hope to fix before the device
can go into production is that the machine occasionally sounds a
false alarm. As for what causes the false positives, the
security-minded Rhykerd says: ``I have a suspicion, but I can't
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhykerd believes that ultimately, the rate of false positives
can be held to 5 percent, ``well below'' that of metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving its accuracy, Rhykerd and his
colleagues hope to overcome two other technical challenges:
decreasing size and cost. The machine is bound to be expensive, but
the benefits could also be high.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, the FAA's Jankowski notes, the CTX5000, a
million-dollar machine designed to inspect luggage, is already in
use at some airports. ``And this device is nowhere near that
expensive,'' he adds. &QL;

CELL PHONE INDUSTRY GRAPPLES WITH 911 SERVICE REQUIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some consumers have been unpleasantly surprised
to discover that dialing 911 from a cellular telephone can mean
getting slower assistance than using a regular phone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Federal Communications Commission last year
ordered wireless carriers to install emergency 911, or E-911,
location-finding technology by October 2001. The 911 service is
available in nearly every part of the United States to summon
police, fire or emergency medical services.
</P>
<P>
   How to implement this new tracking technology was the subject of
a two-day conference held Wednesday and Thursday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was attended by about 130 cellular service
providers, location technology companies and public safety experts
from around the country who huddled over the problems they see in
deploying location-tracking systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-three thousand times a day, a wireless phone is used to
call and summon emergency assistance,'' Thomas Wheeler, president
and chief executive of the Cellular Telephone Industry Association,
said in a videotape played at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the challenge for us is what we can do to raise it to the
next level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies developing location-finding technology see a golden
opportunity in the FCC's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Wireless Corp. of San Ramon, Calif., is trying to offer a
solution. It has developed a location-tracking system and has three
trial-test commitments with major carriers in Oakland, the
Baltimore area and Billings, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Hilsenrath, the chief executive of U.S. Wireless, would
not disclose the names of the carriers for competitive reasons but
said he had high hopes they would sign full agreements for his
company's RadioCamera technology.
</P>
<P>
   RadioCamera is essentially a computer set up in the service
carrier's base station, where all wireless transmission signals are
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Other technologies also are being considered to solve lapses in
completing 911 calls.
</P>
<P>
   SnapTrack Inc. of San Jose, Calif., has come out with a
satellite-based Global Positioning System technology to pinpoint
emergency calls from cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Many wireless service providers cited problems in determining
which location-tracking technology would be best for their networks
and customers, and how that technology would be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, the carriers were concerned about
implementing technology that would most likely become obsolete; how
to choose a technology that's compatible with all wireless phones;
and the short- and long-term costs of implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether carriers have legal immunity for 911 calls is another
big issue. For example, if someone dies because a service provider
mishandles a 911 call, a carrier may get sued.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the biggest issue facing full deployment of 911
location-tracking technology in California, said Reuven Carlyle, a
vice president at Seattle-based XY Point Corp., a company that
develops tracking technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carriers' networks are ready to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Fox, chief technology officer of BellSouth's mobile phone
services unit, conceded that ``the E-911 mandate is a stake in the
ground, a call to action,'' but added that the industry still
needed to do a lot of homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know exactly what our customers will want,'' Fox
said. ``We need more industry trials before we're able to move much
further. We have a not picked a direction yet. We have a lot to
learn. The clock is ticking. We'll look back on this seminar in a
few years and see how little we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the FCC's mandate, which required service
providers to begin using technology that allows public safety
officials to locate the cell phone antenna receiving the call, was
implemented in April.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, to be instituted by October 2001, requires
carriers to determine the location of a caller within about 136
yards, two-thirds of the time. Land-line phones already have
location-tracking systems in place.

WHEREVER ACTION IS, `54' ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Dozens of celebrity imitators flit through the strobe
lights of the disco nights of ``54.'' We're meant to think: Hey,
wasn't that somebody?
</P>
<P>
   Just as we're meant to think: Aren't those people having sex in
the corner? Doing drugs over there? Having some kind of thrill that
we're not?
</P>
<P>
   But all the to-do shudders by in inconsequential fashion in
``54,'' leaving us with the feeling: Who cares who they were
supposed to be or what they were doing? The celebrity-fawning is as
pointless and shallow as the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1970s, ``54'' tells the story of high-priced disco
fever from the point of view of Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a young guy
from Jersey who yearns for the bright lights of the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Shane is pretty enough to attract the eye of Steve Rubell (Mike
Myers), who owns Manhattan's hottest disco, Studio 54, where the
rich, the famous and the abused gather to amuse and debauch
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is a drug maven who wants to throw the world's greatest
party _ every night. He loves the beautiful people, but
particularly pretty boys. He gives Shane a bar job, working
semi-naked, catering to the guests.
</P>
<P>
   Is Shane dazzled by the easy drugs and abundant sex? Would there
be a movie if he wasn't?
</P>
<P>
   Shane wants to make it but also make it real. He wants the sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll, but also peace, love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure what that means, but it involves the efforts of
the coat girl (Salma Hayek) to become a disco singer and her
husband (Breckin Meyer) to hold onto his wife.
</P>
<P>
   All this is conveyed during endless club scenes with everyone
bopping to the beat. Because the look inside the real Studio 54 is
told by someone who didn't know that much about its inner workings,
the movie has no interesting revelations. We've seen the crowd
scenes before in a dozen other party movies.
</P>
<P>
   Because Shane won't let himself go all the way, the film doesn't
even get deep into debauchery, which is ultimately all it has to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like viewing a Roman orgy with a palace eunuch. That's not
where the action is.
</P>
<P>
   The acting and attitudinal faces of the partygoers save the
movie. Phillippe (``I Know What You Did Last Summer'') is confused
and distraught as an empty head getting by on a pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   Myers (``Austin Powers'') is pathetic in a non-shagadelic way as
the aging groovy guy trying to be the life of the party by owning
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``54'' is in no way a subtle movie, so the fact that first-time
writer/director Mark Christopher works at a shallow level is
appropriate. But adding an excessive number of corny moments _ with
Myers barfing on a pile of money and a disco granny doing drugs and
talking dirty _ bops right over the top.
</P>
<P>
   If ``54'' had been made 20 years ago, it might have been a
shocker. Now it's almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   While ``54'' does not cheat the disco music, it's not
top-of-the-chart material, and it doesn't make you want to get up
and boogie. Neither does the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``54'' is rated R for profanity, nudity and sex. 2 stars. &QL;

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens Oct. 15, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens Oct. 15, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of
retirement. And it must be said, they don't like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   While many doubt there will be anything left of Social Security
and Medicare, their savings aren't enough to plug the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that baby boomers overall have not saved enough to
fund their retirements, which could last two decades or more (these
days a 66-year-old is expected to live to the age of 82, according
to the National Center for Health Statistics).
</P>
<P>
   It's a state of affairs that Congress couldn't have imagined in
1935, when it designated 65 as the retirement age. But then, the
average life expectancy was 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   As they contemplate life after 65, many boomers wonder how to
prepare and what kind of world they should prepare for. Worried
questions and fairly reassuring answers follow. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AM I SAVING ENOUGH TO RETIRE AT 65? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends in large part on where and how you want to
live. You probably have a pretty good idea of how much you'd need
for your desired lifestyle in the community where you now reside.
That's a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Take that figure to one of the many Web sites devoted to
retirement (one of the best is www.quicken.com/retire), and use the
on-screen calculator to figure out how much you must save to attain
that post-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a pretty alarming number. You may be able to make it
less alarming by retiring to a lower-cost area.
</P>
<P>
   To compare living costs in different parts of the country (and
the world), use the salary calculator at www.homefair.com. If you
know how much it costs to live well in one city, the calculator
will tell you roughly how much the same kind of life costs in
another.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a generational answer to this question. If you're
one of the 77 million boomers, you probably aren't saving enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP),
even the top 10 percent of income earners have an average of only
$66,000 in financial assets _ not exactly a fat retirement cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The successor generation to the boomers, the 44 million members
of Generation X, are far more thrifty as a group. Last year, 45
percent of Charles Schwab's customers aged 35 or younger
contributed to their IRAs, compared with 31 percent of people
between 36 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   The non-thrifty may even help power the stock market. A number
of economists, comparing savings rates and stock markets in
different countries, have concluded that U.S. stocks have done well
precisely because Americans have saved so little.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the savings, the explanation goes, the more investors
will demand the highest possible returns _ which the U.S. stock
market has delivered over the past ten years. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF THE BOOMERS WISE UP AND START INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT,
WON'T THE MARKET CRASH WHEN THEY TURN 65 AND SELL THEIR STOCKS? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the financial equivalent of the Cold War worry that the
world could be knocked off its axis if every person in China jumped
off a chair at the same moment. It's also about as likely.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see a sudden, wholesale shift from stocks to
fixed-income securities as retirees liquidate 401(k)s, IRAs, and
pension funds. For one thing, not every boomer will turn 65 in 2011
_ don't forget, the baby-boom generation spans 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as older Americans liquidate their savings, younger
ones will be adding to theirs _ after all, they have their
retirements to consider, too.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible threat to the stock market would be a sudden
shift to saving by those who are consuming heavily now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they haven't been saving, they have been spending and
fueling the economy,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief economist of
Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   If boomers suddenly started allocating more of their income to
investments, they would inevitably spend less on products and
services, hurting the economy and, ultimately, the stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONCE I HIT RETIREMENT, SHOULD I INVEST PRIMARILY FOR INCOME? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get into retirement, they tend to be more
conservative in their allocations,'' says Bob Rudell, president of
Scudder Kemper Retirement Services. They switch out of stocks and
into bonds, CDs, and other assets designed to provide current
income instead of long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertrend is emerging. In 1995, some 21 percent of
households headed by people 75 or older invested in stocks, up from
19 percent in 1992, according to the Federal Reserve Board's
``Survey of Consumer Finances.'' At the same time, the percentage
of households investing in CDs and bonds fell.
</P>
<P>
   In part that's because the stock market's performance over the
past ten years has been too good for anyone to pass up, regardless
of age.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retirees, especially younger ones, need growth as
much as income. ``In order for them to be able to afford another
20-plus years, they need to have some of their money growing more
than the rate of inflation and taxes,'' says Charles Foster of
Blankinship &AMP; Foster, financial planners in Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To find an appropriate split between growth and income, try this
rule of thumb suggested by Craig Hoogstra, director of mutual funds
and special services at the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Money you will need to get to in the next five years should be
invested in stable securities such as short-term Treasury bills or
bank CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Money you'll need to call upon in five to ten years is a good
candidate for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Money you won't want to touch for ten years or more belongs in
stocks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL SOCIAL SECURITY BE AROUND WHEN I RETIRE? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy President Clinton's State of the Union
pledge to save the system, Social Security is a fair bet to survive
in some form.
</P>
<P>
   The current system is pay-as-you-go: Taxes on today's workers
pay for the Treasury bonds whose interest payments fund today's
retirees. That's fine until retirees start to outnumber workers.
Then you're going to have some problems.
</P>
<P>
   How bad are these problems likely to be? The Social Security
Administration itself says the present system can't maintain the
current level of benefits past 2030.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one study, by the year 2045, workers could have
to pay between 17 percent and 22 percent of their wages _ about
three times what they pay now _ to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consider the source of some of the most alarming
statements about Social Security. Is it out of pure altruism that
many in the mutual-fund business favor turning Social Security into
a kind of giant 401(k) program?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hand-wringing over Social Security ignores
political reality. Social Security is probably the most popular
social entitlement program in American history. How likely is it
that Washington will let its funding problems fester until it's too
late?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just as with the budget deficit, the thrift crisis,
and any number of other incipient fiscal disasters, we will
probably muddle through somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fixes to the present system are an incremental one, in
which the retirement age is raised in stages while benefits are
reduced and payroll taxes increased, and a semi-privatized system
in which some mandatory savings go into designated mutual funds and
others into a stripped-down Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, Social Security is likely to make up a good
deal less of total retirement income than its current average level
of 30 percent. So keep funding your 401(k). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN I COUNT ON MEDICARE TO COVER ALL OF MY HEALTH-CARE
EXPENDITURES? &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget Social Security _ Medicare is the entitlement program to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The ballooning number of elderly and the rapid increase in
health-care costs have turned the program into a time bomb.
According to the best available estimates, the Medicare trust fund
that pays for hospital and certain nursing and hospice care will
start running a deficit in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to avoid that outcome is to radically revamp the
system. It's too early to predict Medicare's fate, but a good guess
is that it will evolve into a kind of mega-HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now only about 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are
enrolled in managed-care plans, says Lisa Alecxih, vice president
of the Lewin Group, a health-care consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
That percentage is almost sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent budget bill, Congress attempted to spur growth in
managed-care-plan membership by adding coverage of the cost of
eyeglasses, prescription drugs, dental care, and hearing aids. The
trade-off: Most plans limit the doctors and the treatments they
will cover.
</P>
<P>
   That means most Americans will probably need some kind of
supplemental insurance _ but not medigap insurance, which ``is not
the bargain it used to be,'' says the Lewin Group's Lawrence Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees should consider long-term-care insurance, which will
cover not only a prolonged stay in a nursing home but also other
major expenses (such as some organ transplants) that Medicare
doesn't pick up. &QL;

<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering they invented youth as we know it,
baby boomers are no good at growing old.
</P>
<P>
   But not even boomers can fend off aging forever. The year 2011,
when the leading edge of the boom turns 65, just isn't that far
off, and by 2030, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or
older, compared with 7.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like those, even the most stubbornly
youthful boomers are starting to face up to the reality of

<P>
   Remember rock'n'roll? Remember feminism? Those were the warm-up
acts. They were cultural revolutions of power and moment, but the
main attraction, the baby boomers' ultimate coup and 21st century's
first Big Idea, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   What? you say. Bigger than the invention of the teenager? Bigger
than civil rights? Bigger than the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ because the last, best thing the baby boomers are
going to do in this world they've created in their own image is to
grow very old.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hit us yet, but soon old people will be the happening
demographic _ between the years 2010 and 2030, the over-65
population in the U.S. will increase by 75 percent, to more than 69
million souls.
</P>
<P>
   To put their consumer spending power in perspective, consider
that the Census Bureau estimates there are now just under 20
million 15- to 19-year-old ne'er-do-wells afoot. And just look at
how much marketing hype they get, given that most of them don't
have jobs, let alone estates.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a brave new world in which baby boomers redefine what it
means to be old.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly we know in 1998, our parents and grandparents,
contracted with the government (via the Social Security Act of
1935) and private industry (pension plans had become widespread by
the 1930s) to work with Protestant doggedness for 20 years or more
and then to STOP completely and play golf or else sit in a chair
and watch the neighbors come and go from the front window.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current rate of increase in both life expectancy and
quality of life, that scenario doesn't look so viable anymore.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them
are fussing, all right, but not over the aphids in their roses. One
is fussing about the free-book store he's founded, another about
the preservation of the town hall, another about how to identify
the right recipients for a few hundred thousand dollars he wants to
give away.
</P>
<P>
   If you have led a life of healthy self-interest, you may be
surprised in these upcoming years to see how readily the charitable
impulse flows in you _ don't worry, it's as natural as lust once
was _ and it's smart to be prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think of it, this is another good reason to have fun
now _ you may have better things to do later on. &QL;

<P>
   The bustling retirement industry has done its work so well that
people now in their 20s live in mild but persistent anxiety about
not being able to support themselves in old age, while those over
40 suffer full-scale panic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a good thing _ good for our long-flagging national
savings rate, anyway _ but it gives life a rather gloomy,
foreshortened air. Moreover, spending all your time making sure
that you can retire may distract you from an equally important
task: learning how to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I must tread lightly here. Freud was right. Your broker was
right. All the good things you have you owe to deferred
gratification. But I want to speak up for a contrary concept.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the present value of money, but there is
something to be said for the present value of pleasure. I am
speaking not of wanton hedonism but of useful pleasure. Investment
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first rule of pre-retirement: To retire well you
should start to retire now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take travel as our paradigm. Travel is the virtually
universal answer people give when asked what they want to do in
retirement. What they generally mean is that they're too busy for
that kind of indulgence now, but later _ freed _ they will roam the
world.
</P>
<P>
   I hold no special brief for travel, though I'm fond of doing it.
Travel makes you more interesting to yourself, not necessarily to
others. But if you're going to travel you should travel a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred travel _ the ``trip of a lifetime'' embarked on at 65 _
strikes me as a dangerously melancholy idea. For one thing, you're
in better shape for it now.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is one of the arduous pleasures. It generally becomes
less fun once you've reached the age when your right knee wants to
spend the whole journey remembering the Dartmouth game.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the dark side. One of the true joys of travel is
returning to places seen before: to visit a city whose great
monuments you already know so that you can concentrate on the
mundane or grumble enjoyably about the way things have changed. The
prerequisite for returning is going there the first time, and the
time to do that is now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corollary pleasure. Extensive travel provides you
with something precious: a little list of places you would really
not mind never visiting again. There is something very satisfying
about spinning the globe and seeing whole countries you can live
without.
</P>
<P>
   With enough such places on your list, you might find yourself on
some fine retirement day in the full sun of an American summer
saying, ``Let's stay home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As with travel, so with everything else in retirement. If you're
planning to do it later, start doing it now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the margins, the good sense of the rule becomes obvious:
People sail across the ocean and climb mountains at 70, but people
who try to learn the requisite skills for those sports in
retirement tend to end up dead sooner than might otherwise be the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule applies to less extreme behavior, too. ``A life of
leisure is hard work,'' said a friend of mine not long ago. He's
right. If you're planning to move to a new town in retirement, you
should be spending as much time as possible there now; otherwise
you'll be faced with showing up like a new kid on the first day of
summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning to golf...well, I don't know about golf, but
in a sense I suppose what I'm saying here is essentially a golf
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it's all in the backswing, at least that part that
isn't in the follow-through. The moment when you actually hit the
ball _ the lugubrious day of the farewell dinner _ should pass by
virtually unnoticed. Because by the time you retire, you will have
retired already.
</P>
<P>
   Practical objections may be raised. It's hard to hold an
important job and also travel at will, live in two towns, sharpen
your wilderness skills, etc.
</P>
<P>
   True, true, and I am a poor guide here, except in a rather
comic-strip way. I left my last real office job when I was in my
early 40s in search of a more independent life _ and got all too
much of what I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you're retired...,'' said my youngest daughter one
day, exciting my displeasure. (``Who do you think is paying your
tuition?'' etc., etc.) In retrospect, she had a point. I bought a
lot of freedom, not to say self-indulgence, and I ``made some
sacrifices'' in money and security.
</P>
<P>
   My having left the work force 20 years early appears not to have
condemned me to staying in the work force 20 years after the
well-pensioned are teeing up.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go all the way down my lonesome road to
ask some searching questions about whether adjustments might be
possible in your working life.
</P>
<P>
   Is another 20 years of 60-hour work weeks preparing you for
anything except being the exhausted overseer of a
generation-skipping trust?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that health, wealth, and the effective
management of your coming leisure are all you have to worry about,
but of course that isn't the way it works. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 425-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now we are about to sail into heavy weather. The subject is your
companion for the out-years.
</P>
<P>
   All societies contrive to let husbands and wives spend a great
deal of time apart. Our own society, with its usual hypocrisy, has
been brilliant at this.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of the equal-partnership marriage, everyone gets
to work impossibly long hours at the office and then enjoy tightly
structured quality time in child rearing. Without really trying to,
a husband and wife can confine their intimate hours to bed, just
like illicit lovers, except asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement puts an end to all that.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in retirement is of course the stuff of bad jokes _
``for better or for worse but not for lunch,'' ho, ho, ho _ but as
the wise man said, a joke is the epitaph of an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may one day be sharing your house with a
relative stranger. Thus one of the best pre-retirement moves: Get
to know your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean some hideous encounter-group-tell-all sort of
session. After all, a gradually ripening acquaintance is the very
essence of a good marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now might be a good time to arrange an occasional hour of
conversation about something impractical, involving neither money
nor children. And perhaps even a week alone together?
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge taken from such moments may buoy your confidence
in the relaxed joys awaiting you. Alternatively, you may be
horrified. If so, wouldn't it be better to know now?
</P>
<P>
   If it is easy to hide from your husband or wife in the midst of
a busy life, it is easier still to hide from yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself'' has always struck me to be a
hopelessly vague enterprise, so I've never tried it, but
discovering what matters to you in the present that might actually
matter more in the future _ that's a worthy and perhaps doable
task.
</P>
<P>
   The future. If you are in, say, your late 40s, you have begun to
realize that 65 ``isn't that old,'' although you can remember that
people of that age, seen from the vantage of 25, were geezers.
</P>
<P>
   Youth is intolerant and unimaginative. But youth is not always
stupid. You will look like a geezer to plenty of people. You will
have changed. By 65, everyone is a funny valentine.
</P>
<P>
   There is this one good thing that happens to the old. They
become more interested in doing things right. Some people are
blessed with this instinct from the start, but most of us must wait
for the simple realization that at last we don't have time to keep
doing things over.
</P>
<P>
   Doing things right can lead to great achievements, or it can
lead to endless fussing. You are going to be obsessed with
something: the trick is to discover the right obsession.
</P>
<P>
   As I look around at retired people I know, the happiest of them

   The explosion in self-directed retirement plans has, of
necessity, turned millions of Americans into students of investing.
</P>
<P>
   They read magazines like ``Worth,'' join online affinity groups
like the Motley Fool, and trade tips around the watercooler, all to
squeeze a little more return out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trying to do the best for yourself as
an investor. But two basic choices can have a far more dramatic
effect on your well-being in retirement than any portfolio decision
you're likely to make.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, which have absolutely nothing to do with
investing and everything to do with personal freedom, can
dramatically reduce the income you need in retirement _ or increase
the income you have.
</P>
<P>
   The two key choices to make in retirement are what kind of house
to live in and where that house is located.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't mean trading a four-bedroom country French home
in Greenwich for a rusted-out trailer south of Mazatlan. It means
executing the simple geographic arbitrage that American retirees
have been practicing for decades. You know, swap New York for
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in geography and shelter are great surrogates for a
lifetime of investing. Consider the 50-ish homeowner, comfortably
installed in a suburb in the Northeast, looking forward to a good
20 years of life after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming his home costs $25,000 a year to operate, he'll need to
save $500,000 just to run his home in retirement. How long will it
take to save that? If he puts away the current maximum of $10,000 a
year into his 401(k) and it compounds at a 10 percent annual rate,
it will take him nearly 18 years to accumulate $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, our worried friend can ``save'' that $500,000
without picking a single mutual fund _ indeed, without even
touching his portfolio _ just by moving to Arizona or New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Savings like those point up the limitations of the familiar rule
of thumb that says in retirement you need 70 to 80 percent of your
pre-retirement income. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to knock the rule, as it's based on some pretty
solid real-world experience. The 70 to 80 percent range comes from
Georgia State University in Atlanta, where researchers have been
working on something called the RETIRE Project since 1988 (RETiree
Income REplacement _ get it?).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, as in previous years, project leader Bruce Palmer took
multiple income levels and adjusted them for the financial changes
that come with retirement _ retirees no longer pay Social Security
taxes and often pay lower federal, state, and local income taxes,
while their personal savings rate usually drops to near zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers went through the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey to find changes in spending
that occurred at retirement and that reduced (or increased) needed
income by the amount of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, a family earning $30,000 a year before retirement
would see its spending rise by $327 a year, while a family earning
$90,000 would see its expenses decline by $5,246.
</P>
<P>
   Once the researchers found how much was needed to maintain a
given standard of living in retirement, they worked backward to
calculate tax liabilities and added the result to the amount of
income that had to be replaced at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That figure clustered at _ guess what _ around 70 to 80 percent
of pre-retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   The RETIRE Project has compiled similar tables for single-worker
and two-earner families, because marital and earning status have
impacts on taxes and Social Security benefits. But before Social
Security benefits, the calculations regularly show that you need
somewhere between 65 and 85 percent of your pre-retirement income
when you retire.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. All this careful calculation assumes that
after you retire you will make very few changes in how you live.
But if you move, you can come up with a whole new set of figures to
plug into the retirement calculator. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's first look at how trading down in the housing market
affects the need for retirement income. Start with the family home.
At last you own it free and clear. It's worth $400,000 and costs
about $24,000 a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell it, free of capital-gains taxes, and buy a smaller
house for $200,000, you'll have shelter that might cost $12,000 a
year to support and $200,000 of cash left to invest.
</P>
<P>
   You could put that money in a drawer and pay your expenses for
16 years. Invest the same $200,000 and it might earn enough to pay
all your shelter bills for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose your pre-retirement income was $90,000 and you spent
$24,000 on your $400,000 house. A trade-down could cut your income
needs from $56,064 to $48,446. Part of the savings comes from an
expense reduction of $12,000, part from new investment income of
$12,000, and part from the $3,620 in tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   For that $90,000-a-year household, trading down has more value
($27,620) than the household's Social Security benefit ($21,995).
It also cuts the income required from pensions or savings from 47
percent of pre-retirement income to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we can carp at these figures any number of ways. A
move from a high-cost, high-appreciation state like Massachusetts,
New York or California would be a breeze to put into effect, while
a move from a low-cost, low-appreciation state like Texas or
Arizona would be a bit tougher to do.
</P>
<P>
   But for millions of families that have been fortunate in
residential real estate but have done poorly in the private-pension
lottery, the trade-down is likely to be the single best way for
them to improve the quality of their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A more encompassing version of the same idea is to sell your
working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one way millions of American have to get rich _ or at
least richer _ quick. &QL;

working-years home and move to an area with all-around lower costs.
There is even a Web site to help you figure how much you can save.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently used by prospective job changers, the Homefair site
(www.homefair.com) has a salary calculator that will tell you how
much you'll need in one location to match the lifestyle you can buy
with a given income in another location.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that these figures will only get you in the
ballpark. Homefair cautions site users to do their own tax
calculations. Other decisions you make, from the kind of car you
plan to drive to how you plan to spend your time, will also
influence the amount you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   But even the ballpark figures are pretty darn dramatic. Small
wonder that natives in New Mexico and Colorado complain about
immigrants from California inflating home prices. And small wonder
that the snowbird's path from New York to Florida is so well worn.
</P>
<P>
   A move from Manhattan to Fort Myers will cut your cost of living
by an amazing two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that Social Security check doesn't look nearly so puny
and impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Note that we're not suggesting that you buy a double-wide
trailer and live downwind of a feed lot in Amarillo. All we're
talking about is downsizing the house or moving to an area of the
country that isn't congested.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one way millions of American have to get rich _ or at
least richer _ quick. &QL;

<P>
   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, image can be everything. Since there are more
and more media covering more famous and more notorious faces, the
number of random associations of designer labels linked to news
images is proportionately on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While many are absurd and probably have negligible impact on the
label, there are much more serious cases when a product repeatedly
is linked to a negative news story or figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect varies according to the brand and the brand's
personality,'' said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for
Retailing Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
``Some brands are so tiny that anywhere they are noticed can have a
deep impact,'' he said. ``But for a more established brand, it's
not so simple because the power of a brand extends from so many
things, especially the effects of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Being linked to the wrong person can be a serious problem for a
brand, he said. And while brand managers can pay to have their
products placed in movies, on television or on celebrities,
``there's no way you can pay to keep the wrong people from wearing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands are pretty fragile,'' Gordon said. ``The way to tank a
brand like Diesel would be to have Bill Clinton or David Brinkley
wear it, because that kills the effectiveness of the image that the
brand is young and hip. It doesn't have to be someone like Mike
Tyson or the obvious shock of seeing a mass murderer wearing your
sweatshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan got a shock in January when Time magazine ran an
up-close image of Monica Lewinsky wearing a DKNY beret in the
well-worn video clip in which she's embraced by President Clinton.
The hat turned out to be part of a 1992 collection; it sold for
$38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed is the word,'' said Patti Cohen, senior vice
president of public relations, describing her reaction to the
ensuing media requests for information about the hat. ``I got a fax
from the Washington Post asking all these questions about a hat on
the cover of Time,'' she said. ``I couldn't quite get why such a
serious publication would be asking such questions about a hat. I
thought it was an April Fool's Day joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fisher, senior vice president of global communication
at Tommy Hilfiger, said companies naturally want to see their
products shown in the best possible light. But, she said, when
products appear in a negative situation, consumers are smart enough
to realize these images are not a reflection on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's label is geared to images of diversity,
multiculturalism and a broad range of ages, which in some ways
buffers the company from the side effects of unexpected
associations. Whether the label appears on a rhythm and blues
singer like Aaliyah or on President Clinton, who was photographed
in China last month wearing a polo shirt with a Hilfiger crest,
Hilfiger sees these as positive images.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hugh Grant situation, Fisher said, ``I don't think
customers would in any way associate Tommy with, uh, the deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems an obvious conclusion that in an age when
cultural media often is driven by paid product placements, when
sharp-eyed moviegoers and television watchers have become
accustomed to stop-frame images of Kodak cameras and Calvin
Klein-wardrobed sets, consumers notice when these products appear
in other, unexpected places.

   It's like making a deal with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, there is no better product placement than having an
``it'' starlet wearing a designer's drop-dead gown. On the other,
what happens when celebrities are caught in compromising positions
while wearing designer labels with which they have no commercial
association?
</P>
<P>
   Slap a logo on anything and find out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, paying Demi and Bruce to star in an ad campaign is
one thing, but who'd have thought Monica Lewinsky would become an
unwitting Donna Karan spokesmodel when she wore a DKNY beret to a
November 1996 photo op with the president?
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Grant shilling for Tommy Hilfiger? In 1995, the actor
donned a Hilfiger cap for the most unglamorous of occasions _ his
arrest for soliciting a prostitute on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Coco have thought if she knew socialite Jocelyne
Wildenstein _ whose history of cosmetic surgery borders on the
bizarre _ was the sort of person who would create international
headlines as she battled her ex-husband for custody of, among other
things, a $350,000 Chanel couture dress?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the world's most notorious unpaid product pitchman
these days is O.J. Simpson, the man who sent sales of white Ford
Broncos soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handedly, Simpson pumped up sales of Aris Isotoner gloves
and established Bruno Magli's brand name in the United States by
denying he wore the company's shoes and calling them ``ugly-ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, unsolicited, has now taken to wearing a Nike cap to
public appearances. Most notably, he was televised wearing the hat
as he discussed an appeal of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment
against him in the deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Is Nike grateful?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't react in any way,'' said Robert Mitchell, Nike senior
manager of corporate communications. ``The main thing here is that
we did not place that product with him. He just went out and bought
it like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's reaction _ distant, indifferent, but not damning _
illustrates how companies view these random product appearances.
Whether they can really damage brand equity is a tricky issue, even
if the consequences are only comical.
</P>
<P>
   There is one school of public relations that maintains ``any
press is good press.'' Even if the product is associated visually
with an infamous person, the thinking goes, its image is still
subliminally ingrained in the consumer consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, image can be everything. Since there are more
and more media covering more famous and more notorious faces, the
number of random associations of designer labels linked to news
images is proportionately on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While many are absurd and probably have negligible impact on the
label, there are much more serious cases when a product repeatedly
is linked to a negative news story or figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect varies according to the brand and the brand's
personality,'' said Erik Gordon, director of the Center for
Retailing Research at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
``Some brands are so tiny that anywhere they are noticed can have a
deep impact,'' he said. ``But for a more established brand, it's
not so simple because the power of a brand extends from so many
things, especially the effects of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Being linked to the wrong person can be a serious problem for a
brand, he said. And while brand managers can pay to have their
products placed in movies, on television or on celebrities,
``there's no way you can pay to keep the wrong people from wearing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands are pretty fragile,'' Gordon said. ``The way to tank a
brand like Diesel would be to have Bill Clinton or David Brinkley
wear it, because that kills the effectiveness of the image that the
brand is young and hip. It doesn't have to be someone like Mike
Tyson or the obvious shock of seeing a mass murderer wearing your
sweatshirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan got a shock in January when Time magazine ran an
up-close image of Monica Lewinsky wearing a DKNY beret in the
well-worn video clip in which she's embraced by President Clinton.
The hat turned out to be part of a 1992 collection; it sold for
$38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed is the word,'' said Patti Cohen, senior vice
president of public relations, describing her reaction to the
ensuing media requests for information about the hat. ``I got a fax
from the Washington Post asking all these questions about a hat on
the cover of Time,'' she said. ``I couldn't quite get why such a
serious publication would be asking such questions about a hat. I
thought it was an April Fool's Day joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Fisher, senior vice president of global communication
at Tommy Hilfiger, said companies naturally want to see their
products shown in the best possible light. But, she said, when
products appear in a negative situation, consumers are smart enough
to realize these images are not a reflection on the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's label is geared to images of diversity,
multiculturalism and a broad range of ages, which in some ways
buffers the company from the side effects of unexpected
associations. Whether the label appears on a rhythm and blues
singer like Aaliyah or on President Clinton, who was photographed
in China last month wearing a polo shirt with a Hilfiger crest,
Hilfiger sees these as positive images.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Hugh Grant situation, Fisher said, ``I don't think
customers would in any way associate Tommy with, uh, the deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems an obvious conclusion that in an age when
cultural media often is driven by paid product placements, when
sharp-eyed moviegoers and television watchers have become
accustomed to stop-frame images of Kodak cameras and Calvin
Klein-wardrobed sets, consumers notice when these products appear
in other, unexpected places.

`A MERRY WAR': LIFE OF PURE POETRY TENDS TO OLD GROW 
</HEADLINE>
 REVIEW-NYT   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six decades before poetry slams turned a fragile literary art
form into a gladiatorial sport, wiltingly sensitive versifiers who
would faint if asked to declaim their rhymes on a stage could bask
in the fantasy that publishing a slender volume of their exquisite
insights might one day catapult them into international fame and
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As T.S. Eliot had proved and W.H. Auden was showing, in the
1930s, poets could be stars. According to the myth of the starving
artist, to be a great poet was to follow a higher calling worth
almost any sacrifice of material comfort.
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell's early satirical novel, ``Keep the Aspidistra
Flying,'' published in 1936, zeroes in on this form of narcissism
with a chortling sarcasm. Its main character, Gordon Comstock, is
an advertising copywriter who in a dizzy fit of self-congratulation
quits his well-paying job after his first book of poetry is
reviewed favorably by The Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   Penniless but intoxicated with his ostentatiously proclaimed
freedom, George wanders around London with a notebook under his arm
trilling verses to himself about the beauty of ``bending poplars''
and other earthshaking matters. Even as his living conditions
deteriorate, George, who subsists on handouts from his sister,
self-righteously imagines that he exists on a higher, purer plane
than the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   When an American publication pays him $50 for a manuscript,
George goes temporarily insane. Having suddenly achieved
international renown in his own mind, he celebrates his new
imagined status as a wealthy famous man of letters by blowing the
money on a colossal bender. At a fancy restaurant to which George
takes his girlfriend and his editor for dinner, George obnoxiously
toasts his arrival into the upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Orwell's novel has been turned into a witty film in which the
quiveringly ectomorphic Richard E. Grant is George and Helena
Bonham Carter his increasingly exasperated fiancee, Rosemary. The
book and movie's central metaphor is the inescapable aspidistra, a
plain, hardy houseplant nicknamed ``the cast-iron plant,'' that
symbolizes the middle-class destiny George can't avoid no matter
how strenuously he tries.
</P>
<P>
   If ``A Merry War'' isn't much more than a charming period piece,
Robert Bierman has directed it with a fine awareness of the story's
satirical nuances. ``A Merry War'' refers, among other things, to
the embattled relationship between George and Rosemary, a sensible
graphic artist at his advertising agency who endures George's abuse
and outrageous self-dramatization with a patient tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, an actor who tends to go haywire when not carefully
directed, makes George at once insufferable and sympathetic. His
performance has just enough comic detachment and charm to keep
George from seeming monstrous. Ms. Bonham Carter's Rosemary (a
rather thankless role) is the embodiment of patient middle-class
stolidity. Sooner or later, she knows, George will come to his
senses. But until he does, she is willing to endure bedbugs, walks
in the rain (when he can't afford the bus after a country outing in
which he's squandered his borrowed funds on expensive wine), and
other indignities.
</P>
<P>
   Several sharply observed minor characters give the movie an
extra bite. George's wealthy editor, Ravelston (Julian Wadham), who
(in a conflict of interest) wrote The Times review, is an
ultrasuave cynic who is rarely seen without a glass of Champagne in
his hand and his beautiful girlfriend, Hermione (Lesley Vickerage),
nearby wheedling him into bed. Although the haughty, impatient
Hermione gives lip service to socialist values, she is utterly
disdainful of any sign of working-class grit.
</P>
<P>
   After George temporarily descends into poverty, he prates
ludicrously about how the poor are so much more honest and ``real''
than the rich because they have nothing to lose. While living in
squalor, he also stops writing. The small hard-headed film reminds
us that poets, like serious artists everywhere, need coddling. And
it doesn't come from the lower class but from above.

`STORY OF 54': AS IN STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years from now, if Mark Christopher's timid, meandering film
``54'' is spoken of at all, it will probably be lumped together
with Whit Stillman's ``Last Days of Disco'' as one of two movies
released in 1998 to bungle the same opportunity. Both films, while
purporting to examine New York City's voracious late-1970s disco
culture, adopt a primly distanced attitude toward a moment, just
before the AIDS epidemic struck, when voluptuous hedonism became a
kind of mass hysteria. Sex, drugs and disco: you couldn't ask for a
juicier mix. But when it comes to squeezing juice, both movies come
up dry.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher's film is an informal history of Studio 54, the
disco culture's ultimate pleasure dome and celebrity hangout, a
kind of floating Andy Warhol party whose glory days ended abruptly
when the place was raided by the Internal Revenue Service. Unable
to decide if it's a retrospective expose, a ``Saturday Night Live''
spoof or a ``Saturday Night Fever'' retread, ``54'' ends up a
confused mishmash of all of the above. You see garbage bags filled
with cash, a lot of avid cocaine snorting and fleeting glimpses of
Warhol and Truman Capote, but it all feels ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   While the production notes for ``54'' list an impressive roster
of vintage disco hits on the soundtrack, hardly any of them seem to
have made it into the actual movie, which feels strangely
truncated, both musically and dramatically. How could a movie about
the king of all discos not include a single note of music from the
era's two reigning disco queens, Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor?
Even in its abbreviated dance-floor scenes, ``54'' never surrenders
to the beat. The film provides only scattered intimations of the
tribal ecstasy, the beat-driven synergy of light, sound,
drug-enhanced eroticism and the giddy narcissistic euphoria of
imagining yourself at the center of the world, which was the
essence of the Studio 54 experience.
</P>
<P>
   The disco scenes in Stillman's movie are set in a fictional club
that suggests a sedate hybrid of Studio 54 and its arch-rival,
Xenon. Although ``The Last Days of Disco'' has a fuller, more
richly nostalgic soundtrack, the music serves only as an
unobtrusive nostalgic backdrop for another one of Stillman's
articulate comedies of New York WASP manners. The director
conveniently forgot that the decibel levels in those clubs were
much too high to allow his characters to carry on their witty
analytical dialogues in anything less than a shout.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest element of ``54'' is its star Ryan Phillippe,
whose character, Shane O'Shea, sporadically narrates the movie. An
ambitious 19-year-old nobody from Jersey City, Shane drives into
Manhattan one night with a bunch of friends and finds himself the
only member of his party selected for entrance into the magic
kingdom presided over by the club's gay social director, Steve
Rubell (Mike Meyers). But before being allowed in, Shane is told he
must take off his shirt. He obliges happily and displays what one
admiring woman who later takes him to bed describes as the body of
Michelangelo's ``David'' attached to a Botticelli face.
</P>
<P>
   Ascending from busboy to bartender, Shane becomes one of the
club's in-house stars who at the height of his glory drives around
in a car with personalized license plates. The movie pussyfoots
around Shane's rapid ascent. If it were honest, it would be the
story of how a handsome working-class boy, upon discovering his
sexual market value, calculatedly hustles his way up the pecking
order and eventually gets carried away with his ``stardom.''
</P>
<P>
   After his inevitable comeuppance and exile from the magic
kingdom, he emerges chastened. But the movie barely hints at
Shane's embrace of a self-promoting bisexuality, and the outcome of
a crucial scene in which Rubell puts the moves on him is left
ambiguous. Phillippe, however, skillfully captures Shane's
metamorphosis from working-class innocent into a vain, self-deluded
demi-celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most pungent moments suggest the darker side of the
convergence of exploitation and snobbery that Shane's kind of
stardom entails. Whisked off to a fancy Park Avenue party, he finds
himself the butt of sly, condescending humor. Told he's a
troglodyte, he initially accepts it as a compliment, not knowing
what the word means.
</P>
<P>
   Shane is given a tepid love interest, a soap-opera star named
Julie Black (Neve Campbell), who also turns out to be from New
Jersey and who is also trying to hustle her career into high gear.
But Phillippe and Ms. Campbell don't click together, mostly because
of Ms. Campbell's hopelessly insipid acting.
</P>
<P>
   As Rubell, who calibrated Studio 54's nightly chemistry of
celebrities, pretty boys, models, moguls and colorful eccentrics,
Meyers turns in a skin-deep caricature that is only a half-step
away from a comic spoof. Although there is real pathos in the story
of a Brooklyn entrepreneur who suddenly finds himself a New York
social arbiter with all the money, drugs and boys he could possibly
want at his fingertips, Meyers plays Rubell as a groggy, grinning
casualty of his own success. Rubell's charm, energy, ferocity and
desperate eagerness to belong are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie might have worked had it decided which story it wanted
to tell and stuck to its guns. But instead of exploring the hearts
and souls of its urban dreamers, it feels like a crudely
patched-together collection of notes for a project that got lost on
the cutting-room floor.

`WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE': MUSICAL AND ROMANTIC ONE-TRICK PONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the raucous, comic ``Rashomon'' of rock-and-roll titled ``Why
Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the brief, meteoric career and busy,
turbulent marital life of the singer Frankie Lymon furnish the
pretext for a trip through time to the 1950s and '60s, when much of
a generation fell under the spell of a new kind of music.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, this uneven but often entertaining movie, written
by Tina Andrews and directed by Gregory Nava, whose credits include
``Selena'' and ``El Norte,'' manages to recapture some of the
excitement and turmoil of those days, revel in high spirits and
lowdown humor and provide a happy sampler of hits like the title
song, as well as ``Goody Goody,'' ``ABC's of Love,'' Little
Richard's hit ``Tutti Frutti'' and the Platters' hit ``The Great
Pretender.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most mediocre, this post-mortem farce, built around a
battle for Lymon's estate among three women, each claiming to be
his wife and the heir to his royalties, is compounded of courtroom
scenes that will leave lawyers gnashing their teeth, shaky acting,
ludicrous lines, unconvincing locations and backgrounds and cliched
efforts to evoke nostalgia and achieve psychological depth through
grainy montages.
</P>
<P>
   Musically speaking, Frankie Lymon was pretty much of a one-trick
pony who was a 13-year-old soprano from Upper Manhattan at the end
of 1955, when his recording of ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' with
four neighborhood boys called the Teenagers catapulted them to
doo-wop fame.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1957, after four hits, a cross-country tour,
recordings for an Alan Freed film and an appearance at the London
Palladium, Lymon had parted company with the rest of the quintet.
His solo career was a failure. He drifted into despair and picked
up a heroin habit. But he seemed to have overcome it when, just
before a scheduled recording date in a comeback effort in 1968, he
died of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   The film picks up the story in 1985, a few years after the Diana
Ross version of ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' made the song a hit
all over again. According to the film, this brought the major women
in Lymon's life out of the woodwork: Halle Berry as Zola Taylor,
the glamorous lead singer of the Platters, the supposed first wife;
Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters, a shoplifter who met Lymon after
his heyday and said she turned to prostitution to try to help him
overcome his drug habit, and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle, the
reserved Southern schoolteacher who married Lymon while he was in
the Army, settled with him into a serene domestic life, saw him off
on his last fatal trip and buried him. All seem to have a good time
with their roles, and Larenz Tate, though far less baby-faced than
the original, makes an appealing Lymon.
</P>
<P>
   The indecorous courtroom contest that makes enemies and friends
of the three women as their lives with Lymon are depicted in
flashback also brings to the stand Little Richard as an
irrepressible witness, situates Pamela Reed on the Surrogate's
Court bench as the incredulous and incredibly lenient judge and
casts Paul Mazursky as the villain of the piece, Morris Levy, the
owner of Roulette Records who collected millions in proceeds from
the success of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Lymon's career may have been short and sad, but ``Why Do Fools
Fall in Love'' finds the melodrama of his life in the exciting
music of his time and the tumult of his romances.

   EMBASSY-BOMBINGS-FBI (Washington) _ Although FBI Director Louis
Freeh praises the work of U.S. investigators for the capture of a

BUFFETT KEEPS CARNIVAL ROLLING AT GREAT WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSFIELD, Mass. _ In Jimmy Buffett's new book, ``A Pirate Looks
at Fifty,'' he states why he thinks his audiences come back year
after year. ``It is the spirit of the Carnival,'' he writes. ``It
knows no rules or geographical boundaries. It is a vaudevillian
slap in the face of the hard realities of day-to-day life.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, prepare to get slapped again.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is back for three summer-climaxing nights, once again
drawing a total of 60,000 carnival-seekers. And Wednesday night,
Buffett satiated them with more musical theater than ever. He sang
three new songs from his Broadway-hopeful musical, ``Don't Stop the
Carnival,'' while his band dressed in blindingly colorful island
costumes. He even did a skit as the story's central character, a
stressed-out Manhattan public relations man who runs away to the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has lived a similar escape _ it's the basis of his Midas
touch _ and he's still on the road singing about it. As a
court-jesting tapper of the pleasure principle, he remains without
peer. Wednesday night's show, while slow to ignite, still reached
blastoff, as he and a sea of red-eyed Parrotheads found their
nirvana together.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett started the show slowly, playing a first set that had a
few obscure numbers such as ``The Weather Is Here, I Wish You Were
Beautiful'' and the country-inflected ``Take Another Road.'' It was
daring to sandwich them all in a row, and it didn't quite work.
</P>
<P>
   The set picked up, however, with classics ``Pencil Thin
Moustache'' and ``Come Monday,'' followed by the festive ``Public
Relations'' (from ``Carnival'') and the heat-raising ``Changes in
Latitude, Changes in Attitude,'' ``Cheeseburger in Paradise'' (with
a video of him flipping burgers in a funky Southern restaurant),
and ``Last Mango in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett made repeated references to the hurricane working its
way up the coast (``This is the calm before the storm!'' he yelled)
and to the tropical heat (no joke) at Great Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As he does every year, Buffett had some new tricks to go along
with the pan-Caribbean music played by his 10-piece band, led by
keyboardist Mike Utley and steel pan player Robert Greenidge (who,
as members of the side band Club Trini, serenaded fans by the front
entrance before the show). For the top new trick, Buffett showed a
video made that day of him bicycling around Boston Back Bay wearing
a Boston Red Sox cap and looking like a tourist on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   The second set was a winner throughout. It started with an
acoustic mini-set featuring the poetic ``Son of a Son of Sailor''
and ``A Pirate Looks at Forty,'' before a ribald segue from ``Bali
Hai'' (from the musical ``South Pacific'') to ``Why Don't We Get
Drunk,'' with a hula-skirted dancer. ``You won't see this in Disney
World,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   And then he rocked out: ``One Particular Harbor'' to
``Margaritaville'' to ``Southern Cross'' and ``Fins,'' and a
surprise encore of Frankie Ford's ``Sea Cruise.'' The carnival was
nearly complete.

BOY SURVIVES SHARK ATTACK OFF CALIFORNIA COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A shark attacked a teen-aged boy who was
enjoying one of the last days of summer boogie-boarding with
friends, causing two deep wounds to the youngster's right thy.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kathrein, 16, of San Rafael was hospitalized after the
attack Wednesday, but a spokeswoman for the John Muir Medical
Center in Walnut Creek said the injuries were not considered
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, Kathrein was on his boogie board in
about 5 feet of water, 50 yards out from Stinson Beach, said
Suzanne Summers, a spokeswoman for the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area, which includes the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrein felt something bump his board and then the shark's jaw
closed around his thigh, pulling him off the board, she said.
</P>
<P>
   His friends heard him scream for help, and by the time they, and
a lifeguard, reached him, he had managed to pull himself back onto
the boogie board and begin paddling for shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this blood, and then we saw his whole entire leg was
right open,'' said Bradley Carroll, another surfer who witnessed
the attack. ``It was really scary. It could have been me. I was
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge Kathrein, Jonathan's mother, spoke to her son by telephone
shortly after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very brave, and he said, `I'm OK, mom, but my leg
really hurts,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first shark attack ever documented at Stinson Beach,
although the beach has been closed from time to time because of
shark sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks inhabit the waters all along the California coast,
frequently hunting seals and sea lions, experts say.

`MY BEST FRIEND MOVED AWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Sept. 3)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam learned to ride his bike by going to Johnny's house.
</P>
<P>
   From our driveway, his father and I would watch his white helmet
bob like a pingpong ball until it drifted over to the Colemans'
doorstep and disappeared inside.
</P>
<P>
   How lucky our 7-year-old was, I thought, to have a best friend
within a baseball's throw of our front porch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Coleman family moved into our Plant City (Fla.)
neighborhood four years ago, I had staked out their house. We lived
in a quiet subdivision with several retirees and widows, but few
children. So when I noticed the boys' bicycles leaning against
their garage wall and the in-line skates in the driveway, I was
hoping for an age-compatible playmate for my preschooler.
</P>
<P>
   While riding my bike through the neighborhood one day, I stopped
to introduce myself to Marie, the serene matriarch of the Coleman
clan. As luck would have it, her 3-year-old son was just a few
months older than mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if Johnny could come down and play with Adam for a
few hours,'' I said. Despite this being the first time we'd met,
Marie searched my face for a few seconds, then strapped him into
the toddler seat on the back of my bike.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a fine friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny and Adam progressed from wading pools and Duplos to
diving into the deep end of a neighbor's in-ground pool and
exploring the trails through the scrub pine woods behind our home.
</P>
<P>
   The night before first grade, Adam told his father he had prayed
that both his best friends _ Joshua and Johnny _ would be in his
class. Unsure how to dispel the notion that God arranges elementary
school class rosters, Jim just nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into Mrs. Adam's class that morning, we were floored to
see Johnny and Joshua sitting at their new desks. Adam wasn't
surprised in the least.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were sometimes weeks where tempers flared or
feelings were hurt, Adam and Johnny remained friends throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the teacher became concerned about him at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam seems to have little interest in making new friends,''
she wrote on his progress report. ``He's extremely loyal to the
ones he already has.''
</P>
<P>
   As his parents, though, we were happy with his choice. Johnny
was a polite, bright child who shared many of Adam's interests. And
they were learning diplomacy with each other, becoming less eager
for adult intervention during their bickering.
</P>
<P>
   Many a Saturday afternoon, especially after Adam's little
sister, Sarah, arrived on the scene, I would invite Johnny over or
send Adam to his house, gaining a few hours to play with the baby
or catch up on chores.
</P>
<P>
   So when the decision for our family's move to Atlanta was
reached, Johnny and Adam went through the pangs that are universal
to best friends everywhere: How do we say goodbye?
</P>
<P>
   There was the all-night Nintendo fest/sleepover, the dinner out
at their favorite pizza joint, a trip to Discovery Zone to play
``Men in Black'' laser tag. But the most heart-rending, at least to
their parents, were the letters and gifts that were passed back and
forth the last week: a favorite Gak pack, a note reading ``You will
be my best frend (sic) always,'' a gray-and-blue Orlando Magic
T-shirt, and a computer print-out photo of Johnny and Adam with
their arms slung around each other's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the move, they played with favorite action figures on
the boxes and ran from room to empty room in our house, trying to
preserve the adventure of the day instead of the inevitable ending.
</P>
<P>
   The final goodbye was brief _ just a quick handshake in the
front yard _ but there were tears over unrelated slights for hours
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   When we called Marie soon after settling into our new home, she
said Johnny's first assignment in second grade was to write about
who he was and what his summer had been like. This is what he
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Johnny Coleman. I have eight people in my family.
Hockey is my favorite sport. My best friend moved away.''

 &HT;    ISRAEL BOMBING KILLS NONE, BRINGS TERROR SPREE BACK TO ISRAEL
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV A rush-hour bombing Thursday killed no one but injured
18 Israelis, left impressions of nails in metal window panes and
the brought world's latest act of terror to Israel, so often its
target.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims of the nail bomb, placed in a large plastic
trash bin on the corner of two four-lane streets, were lightly
injured and had already been released from the hospital by Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But, windows were shattered up to the third floors of buildings
on both sides of the street, attesting to the deadly potential of
what police said was just a small, possibly one pound, bomb. The
steel post of a nearby pay telephone was punctured and shredded by
shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no arrests by Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting victims in a
Tel Aviv hospital, said the bombing appeared to the work of a
Palestinian terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   He said it could not be linked to the spree of bombings lately,
including at a Planet Hollywood in South Africa and the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, except that it showed the need to
fight terrorism worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu referred to recent comments by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in vowing an American war against terror, and said that
Israel has been making that effort already. ``That is precisely our
policy,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came a week after a rabbi was killed in his house in
Hebron, in an area occupied by Israel since the 1967 war, and a
couple weeks after two Jewish settlers were ambushed and killed in
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   However, all indications were that the peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians over land captured by Israel in the
1967 war would apparently continue, albeit in the same faltering
way they have for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on terrorism lately has centered on threats to
Americans, sounded recently by fundamentalists reportedly connected
to dissident Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. For Israelis on the
streets of Tel Aviv, the bombing made a scene that was disturbing
but familiar.
</P>
<P>
   A damaged clock was stopped at 8:39 a.m., the (local) time of
the bombing, in the key shop of 50-year-old Moshe Mendelson, who
had crouched against a wall when he heard the explosion across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   His front window was shattered and his glass counter broken by
debris, but he was uninjured and lucky that a minivan was between
him and the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is we are thinking about it all the time. It is in
our veins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the bombing, his shop was open for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do. We just have to go on. What they
want to do is interrupt our lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson also wanted the Israeli government to go on with the
peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat condemned the
bombing but Netanyahu said the peace process would progress if
Arafat fought terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Steinberg, professor of political science at Tel Aviv's
Bar Ilan University, said the fact that there were no fatalities in
the bombing would keep it from derailing the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would account for coverage in the local media
that was subdued compared to two suicide bombings that killed 21
people last summer.

`LAST KABBALIST OF LISBON': A RIDDLE IN A MYSTERY ABOUT MYSTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What lives for centuries but can still die before its own
birth?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that cabalist riddle _ or at least what Richard
Zimler presents as a cabalist riddle in his intriguing mystery of
16th-century Lisbon _ will not be disclosed here, but you can find
out in ``The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon'' (as Zimler spells the term
for Jewish mysticism).
</P>
<P>
   My prediction is that you won't regret spending a few hours with
this book. I'm not sure how deep your understanding of cabala will
become, but you will find yourself drawn into a moody, tightly
constructed historical thriller that is both entertaining and
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Zimler, an American writer who has lived in Portugal since 1990,
has invented a manuscript that, he explains in a preface, was
discovered a few years ago in Istanbul inside a tik, a small
cylindrical chest traditionally used by Sephardic Jews to house the
Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament. Inside this tik
was not a Torah but a cache of manuscripts by one Berekiah Zarco,
all written with the sort of reed pen used in 16th-century Iberia.
Seven of the volumes are treatises on cabala, but three, written in
the form of an early picaresque novel, tell the story of the murder
of Berekiah's revered uncle, a great cabalist scholar from Lisbon
named Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Zimler's description of this discovery is clever enough to seem
real rather than part of a fictional conceit. He is not persuasive
on every page, however, as he tries to create the impression of an
authentic early Renaissance document written from inside the
chiaroscuro world of hidden Jewry in the years of the Portuguese
Inquisition. Here and there modern locution creeps into his text _
a reference to pragmatism, for example, or the appearance of a bit
of dialogue tinged with a late-20th-century sensibility _ like
``Save it, Carlos! I don't want your protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The author also frequently uses ``gift'' as a verb, as in, ``I
realized the powers of disguise gifted to the man I need to bring
to justice,'' which seems stilted without being authentic to the
period.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking ``The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon'' is both
a good mystery story and an effective evocation of a faraway time
and place. Zimler begins by subjecting Berekiah's manuscript to
some critical scrutiny, citing evidence that it is authentic and
wondering why there is no mention of it in ``contemporaneous Jewish
manuscripts.'' Possibly, he conjectures, Berekiah's ``disparaging
characterizations of Old Christians'' _ as distinct from the Jewish
``conversos,'' or ``New Christians'' _ and his ``treatment of such
topics as sex and the schism between cabbalists and rabbinical
authorities,'' led him to suppress his own writings, although they
have happily resurfaced now.
</P>
<P>
   Berekiah says that he began writing his tale in the Hebrew year
5267, corresponding to the Christian year 1507. The Jews had been
expelled from Spain in 1492. Portuguese Jews were forcibly
converted to Christianity in 1497, but in 1506, some 2,000 of these
New Christians, suspected of secretly observing Jewish rites, were
massacred in an orgy of fire and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Berekiah's story takes place during several days of Passover
that year, during and just after the massacre. His Uncle Abraham,
whom he calls ``my master,'' is found murdered in the hidden cellar
synagogue of the family house in the old Lisbon Jewish quarter. The
rest of the story involves Berekiah's investigation of the crime
and his effort to find and punish the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The murder scene, as investigated by Berekiah, is both
intriguing and disturbing. Next to Abraham is a naked young girl,
also stabbed to death. Semen is found on the uncle's thigh, so it
looks as if he had been engaging in illicit fornication when he was
killed. The door to the cellar had been bolted from inside when
Berekiah broke into the room and discovered the corpses, so how did
the murderer make his way out? The throats of both victims had been
cut just below the windpipe, as if by a shohet, a Jewish ritual
slaughterer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a traitorous New Christian led the followers of the
Nazarene to my uncle, then slit his throat?'' Berekiah wonders. ``I
pictured a Dominican friar rousing the mob to break into our
cellar, my master taken and handed over to this Jewish mercenary
like a sacrificial lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   We do in the end learn who killed Uncle Abraham and the young
girl, but not before Zimler has taken us on a colorful journey
though Lisbon, phantasmagorically caught up in the ritual of
slaughtering Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cast of characters, most of them secret Jews, are a
priest named Carlos, several members of a secret cabalist group
assembled by Abraham to smuggle Hebrew texts out of Portugal and a
presumed nobleman, the count of Almira, who seems, like others in
this story, to have a keen interest in ancient Hebrew texts. The
murdered Abraham himself was a renowned manuscript illustrator, and
Berekiah finds clues to the murder in his illustrations of a
Haggadah, the Passover prayer book, in which some of the characters
of the novel are portrayed as biblical figures.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are here and there some fragments of cabalistic
lore: ``Books are created from holy letters,'' Berekiah tells a
certain Dom Miguel, one of his uncle's smugglers. ``Just as angels
are, according to some. Viewed from this perspective _ through a
window of kabbalah, if you like _ an angel is nothing but a book
given heavenly form.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zimler brings us to the conclusion of his ``translation'' of
Berekiah's rediscovered text, it is passages like this one, little
riffs of mysticism and Jewish lore, that give his book its special
and endearing character.

IN SOUTH TEXAS, TORRENTIAL RAINS EASE DROUGHT RESTRICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JERRY NEEDHAM  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The silver lining in the recent tropical downpour
in South Texas is that the drought appears to be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in San Antonio and the Edwards Aquifer water
authority that serves the region eased water-use restrictions
Wednesday, although they urged continued conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authority recognizes that many water suppliers have opted
to remain in conservation mode, and we applaud those efforts,''
said Greg Ellis, the Edwards Aquifer agency's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are reducing the water-use restrictions now, it is
important for citizens to remember that we still have five or six
weeks of potentially hot weather left in our South Texas summer,''
San Antonio City Manager Alex Briseo said. ``With that in mind, we
urge citizens to keep their outdoor water use to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions under both the aquifer authority's and city's
drought-response plans were triggered at the same time by falling
aquifer levels earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains triggered by a sputtering Tropical Storm Charley
caused severe flooding along the Rio Grande in South Texas and in
Mexico. At least 17 deaths have been blamed on the flooding on both
sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis called the rainfall ``temporary relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a region, we need to stay focused on using water
efficiently year-round to help get us through the dry spells,''
Ellis said. ``We need to start thinking about next summer, and the
water we don't use today will help increase aquifer levels next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought-response plans are designed to slow the rate at
which water is withdrawn from the aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   The authority can impose administrative fines of up to $1,000
per day per violation and also file lawsuits to seek civil
penalties.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A few years back, an aspiring screenwriter
named Robb Bindler walked out of a Longview bar, astonished to see
bright lights blazing at a nearby Nissan dealership _ at 2 a.m.
Curious, Bindler walked over to investigate, and found a bunch of
people standing with their hands on a fully loaded $15,000 pickup.
They had been there for hours, and the last person to take his or
her hand off the pickup got to take it home. Silly stuff, Bindler
thought, and kinda boring. He watched for a half-hour, then headed
home. Six years later, Bindler's late-night adventure has evolved
into one of the best movies to play these parts in 1998. ``Hands on
a Hard Body,'' the first-time filmmaker's movie about the contest,
is a funny, fascinating and ultimately moving documentary about
competition, companionship, endurance and the importance of having
a pickup in Texas. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''

problem.'' -- Emmet Fox)

</P>
<P>
   The prophets of Old Testament times, esteemed in leadership
positions, assumed two major roles in their society:
</P>
<P>
   --As advisers they had an aptitude for solving the problems that
confronted the ancient Hebrews.
</P>
<P>
   --As seers they had the ability to anticipate the outcomes of
various plans the ``chosen people'' considered as their culture
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seers are sometimes called research analysts because they
seek to anticipate outcomes. Advisers are known as doctors,
lawyers, merchants, business executives, and others who also try to
anticipate outcomes and solve problems in their area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Emmet Fox, a twentieth-century author and problem-solver, wrote
that the only way to solve a problem is to ``lift your
consciousness above the level where you met the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem appears as an obstacle unlikely to be seen accurately
because it dominates our mental landscape. From the meadow, the
forest may appear ominous and troubling; the trees may seem to
block our journey to a desired destination.
</P>
<P>
   A lifted consciousness, however, functions like a hot air
balloon -- when it gets up high enough, the forest can be revealed
in is entirety, and shown in proper relationship to its
surroundings. Distance, height, and growing awareness can provide
an encompassing perspective that may be helpful in showing us how
to cope with challenging circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Often a successful problem-solver is one who creates a new
context in which to view the problem. This can often be done by
directing one's attention away from the distracting details of the
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   From a detached perspective, we may examine the situation in a
new or different light and, after exploring information and
options, choose an appropriate course of action.
</P>
<P>
   King Solomon was noted for his wisdom. As an aid in solving the
problems that were presented to him, he examined the inner
motivation of the participants in order to gain perspective.
</P>
<P>
   His decision in the case of two women who claimed the same child
has become legend and illustrates how he used wisdom and
imagination to get inside of people's true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon examined the motivation of the woman by suggesting that
the infant be divided in half so that each woman could have an
equal share of the child. The true mother begged him not to do so,
preferring that her child should live, even if with the other
woman, rather than be destroyed so that she could have her ``fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon easily determined the rightful parent by her concern for
the child.
</P>
<P>
   Prophets are perhaps most widely acclaimed for their ability as
seers. But prophets are not the only ones endowed with some
capacity to anticipate outcomes. Each one of us possesses the
ability to discern, that is, to make choices. Each one of us can
examine the appearance of a situation, look at motives, and then
make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some judgments or choices must be made based on information from
the five senses -- touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Other judgments yield more beneficial results when made at the
level beyond what may be readily available as fact. This kind of
discernment may be recognized through a hunch (sometimes called
intuition), and sometimes it may be deemed truly wise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph E. Coleman, a neuropathologist, has for many years
made a study of psychophysics -- the science of relations between
mental and physical processes and phenomena. Today this science is
closely connected with such other new sciences as biophysics,
cybernetics, biomedical engineering, and medical sciences of a
neural or behavioral type.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman made a speciality of the relationship of the seen and
the unseen, the physical and the nonphysical, the body and the mind
in our human existence -- a speciality that was waiting for ages to
have persons of high quality devote their attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper entitled ``The Enigmas of Psychophysics,'' Dr.
Coleman writes, ``Man is innately curious about life and its
significance. His curiosity has caused him to search (and research)
in hope of escaping the dissatisfactions of the present and of
obtaining a future knowledge and freedom from discontent.... Modern
medical science considers the mind and the living physical body
inseparable parts of the whole person.''
</P>
<P>
   This wonderful ``mind'' within each person may be the catapult
to lift us above the present level of any problem.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you may not be able to change or control the people or
circumstances around you, but you can determine the level of
consciousness on which you meet them and react to any situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most significant discoveries we can make. You
do not have to be fearful, and you really do not have to worry or
be anxious. You can determine your reaction and then your course of
action, and you can choose a higher level of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Testament prophets understood higher wisdom and
judgment. They used it; they sought to anticipate results as a way
to solve problems. They were the leaders of their day.
</P>
<P>
   Often the ability exists today in you, as it did in the ancient
prophets, to rise above the problem, examine motives, look at
options, and make choices.

 &HT;    PRESSURE MOUNTS ON YELTSIN TO LEAVE AS RUBLE CONTINUES ITS
FREEFALL
 &HT;    With LATAM-ECONOMY-0828.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian ruble continued its uncontrolled drop in
value Thursday, a free-fall that sent shock waves through the
world's stock markets and placed increasing pressure on President
Boris Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirled throughout Moscow of Yeltsin's imminent
resignation, prompting the Kremlin to issue repeated and firm
denials of what it called ``absolutely groundless, idle
inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from a political vacuum and ever-deeper economic
chaos, Russia offered further evidence Thursday that its central
bank has lost its grip on the tattered banking and currency system.
</P>
<P>
   The bank indefinitely suspended exchange-trading of the ruble
after its value slid Thursday nearly 50 percent from where it stood
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The official exchange rate of 7.86 rubles to the U.S. dollar,
like the ruble itself, was rendered meaningless. The value of the
ruble was essentially left to be determined on the streets, where
it was trading as low as 11.5 to the U.S. dollar, compared to 6.2
on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin, struggling to form
a new government after Yeltsin cleaned house Sunday, said he was
``doing my utmost to avert a disaster for the country and the
people.'' He said he would pursue market reforms while dealing with
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander Shokhin, the leader of a parliamentary faction
aligned with Chernomyrdin, said the new government may implement
Soviet-style price controls and state ownership of some banks and
companies. It may also eliminate the ruble's status as a
convertible currency and print more money to pump up the economy at
the risk of sparking massive inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps would reverse Russia's evolution to free-market
capitalism since the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy and the chill it has cast over global markets
will dominate the summit between Yeltsin and President Clinton
scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's largest creditor, Germany, warned the government
Thursday that it could expect no further aid from the West unless
it pursues meaningful free-market reforms. ``Without he reforms it
will not be possible to mobilize money,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, dollars were scarce as Russians clamored to trade
their rubles for a safe-haven currency. To protect their assets,
banks have frozen or limited withdrawals, making it difficult for
Russians to retrieve their savings and impossible for some
companies to pay wages or buy imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin remained in seclusion at his country residence,
Chernomyrdin held consultations with opposition leaders, including
Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov, increasing speculation that
he will seek to form a coalition-style government.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov said the Kremlin was becoming increasingly amenable to
Communist Party demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament, is
to decide Friday when it will schedule debates on the issue of
Chernomyrdin's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and other opposition parties continued the call for
Yeltsin's resignation. A commission of government officials and
opposition parliament members drafted a broad power-sharing
agreement that would force Yeltsin to give lawmakers more control
over cabinet appointments and government policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin angrily denied the speculation about Yeltsin's
resignation, including a CBS News report that Yeltsin had signed an
order providing for his resignation sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Linnik, editor of Pravda newspaper, called the ailing
Yeltsin, 67, ``a president who is ruling in absentia.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts said it was doubtful that Yeltsin would resign
before Chernomyrdin wins Duma confirmation as prime minister. It
also seemed unlikely that Yeltsin would leave office before his
scheduled summit with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The United States urged Russia's new government not to abandon
pro-market economic reforms and to move quickly to stabilize its
battered economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it changed course in any kind of fundamental way that would
be a serious concern to us,'' Clinton's National Security Adviser
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Yeltsin would be in his offices there on Friday
where he is scheduled to meet with the visiting Bulgarian
president. Yeltsin also will hold consultations with Chernomyrdin
on the political and economic crisis, and with acting Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on the upcoming summit with Clinton.

taking Latin America down with it.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial crisis, along with depressed markets in Asia,
is sending Latin stocks into a tailspin while pushing interest
rates higher to ward off concerns that currency devaluations might
spread.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many analysts have become wary over the future of
Latin America's leading markets, which were among the darlings of
emerging markets only in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and Asia have sneezed and Latin America may catch
pneumonia,'' said Jerry Haar, a senior research associate at the
University of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be rough sledding through 1999,'' he said. ``And
we sure haven't seen the worst of it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thanks to a flurry of economic reforms across Latin
America in recent years, including the privatization of antiquated
state-run enterprises and the overhaul of banking systems, few
expect a repeat of the recession that swept the region in 1981 on
the heels of a debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts still predict a regional growth rate of 2 to 3 percent
this year, compared to 5.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot rides on politics and on the performance of Latin
America's own policymakers over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Stock indexes in Mexico and Brazil have fallen to at least
19-month lows this week. Markets also have tumbled in Argentina,
Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela as regional dollar bonds have
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Among currencies, the Mexican peso has suffered the most,
falling 21.7 percent this year, to 10.19 American cents.
</P>
<P>
   But in general it's Venezuela that's been hit hardest by the
financial turmoil. There, a drop in oil prices already has had an
impact on a worrisome budget deficit and raised fears of a currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan stock market has plunged to a 29-month low, while
bonds are trading at levels not seen since the country's banking
crisis in 1995. At the same time, interest rates have skyrocketed
as the government works to raise money to finance its ballooning
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse from an investor's standpoint, a populist
presidential candidate, Hugo Chavez, has made a lot of noise about
not paying the foreign debt and is now favored to win December's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, President Carlos Menem said Thursday that the
economy will bear up despite market turmoil that has sliced 40
percent off Argentine stock values this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peso will not move one cent. The banking system is intact
and the stock market is slowly recovering from an imbalance, which
is not ours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also are watching Brazil, Latin America's largest
economy, where speculators have begun a new assault on the
currency, the real, hoping to force a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   To fend off these attacks, Brazil's central bank on Monday
unveiled measures to attract dollars and keep foreign reserves at
$70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is not doing too bad because it just privatized its
phone company and got more than $14 billion, but where are they
going to get $14 billion next summer?'' Haar asked.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brazil sold its 19 percent interest in the
state-controlled phone utility Telebras to raise badly needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   October's presidential election has added to a climate of
uncertainty in Brazil and so, if investors were to lose confidence,
a devaluation of the real would be likely.
</P>
<P>
   But President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who's running for
re-election, said the economy will remain sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the means to react calmly and firmly,'' he said.

 &HT;    PRESSURE MOUNTS ON YELTSIN TO LEAVE AS RUBLE CONTINUES ITS
FREEFALL
 &HT;    With LATAM-ECONOMY-0828.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian ruble continued its uncontrolled drop in
value Thursday, a free-fall that sent shock waves through the
world's stock markets and placed increasing pressure on President
Boris Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirled throughout Moscow of Yeltsin's imminent
resignation, prompting the Kremlin to issue repeated and firm
denials of what it called ``absolutely groundless, idle
inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from a political vacuum and ever-deeper economic
chaos, Russia offered further evidence Thursday that its central
bank has lost its grip on the tattered banking and currency system.
</P>
<P>
   The bank indefinitely suspended exchange-trading of the ruble
after its value slid Thursday nearly 50 percent from where it stood
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The official exchange rate of 7.86 rubles to the U.S. dollar,
like the ruble itself, was rendered meaningless. The value of the
ruble was essentially left to be determined on the streets, where
it was trading as low as 11.5 to the U.S. dollar, compared to 6.2
on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister-designate Viktor Chernomyrdin, struggling to form
a new government after Yeltsin cleaned house Sunday, said he was
``doing my utmost to avert a disaster for the country and the
people.'' He said he would pursue market reforms while dealing with
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander Shokhin, the leader of a parliamentary faction
aligned with Chernomyrdin, said the new government may implement
Soviet-style price controls and state ownership of some banks and
companies. It may also eliminate the ruble's status as a
convertible currency and print more money to pump up the economy at
the risk of sparking massive inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps would reverse Russia's evolution to free-market
capitalism since the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy and the chill it has cast over global markets
will dominate the summit between Yeltsin and President Clinton
scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's largest creditor, Germany, warned the government
Thursday that it could expect no further aid from the West unless
it pursues meaningful free-market reforms. ``Without he reforms it
will not be possible to mobilize money,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, dollars were scarce as Russians clamored to trade
their rubles for a safe-haven currency. To protect their assets,
banks have frozen or limited withdrawals, making it difficult for
Russians to retrieve their savings and impossible for some
companies to pay wages or buy imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin remained in seclusion at his country residence,
Chernomyrdin held consultations with opposition leaders, including
Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov, increasing speculation that
he will seek to form a coalition-style government.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov said the Kremlin was becoming increasingly amenable to
Communist Party demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament, is
to decide Friday when it will schedule debates on the issue of
Chernomyrdin's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and other opposition parties continued the call for
Yeltsin's resignation. A commission of government officials and
opposition parliament members drafted a broad power-sharing
agreement that would force Yeltsin to give lawmakers more control
over cabinet appointments and government policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin angrily denied the speculation about Yeltsin's
resignation, including a CBS News report that Yeltsin had signed an
order providing for his resignation sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Linnik, editor of Pravda newspaper, called the ailing
Yeltsin, 67, ``a president who is ruling in absentia.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts said it was doubtful that Yeltsin would resign
before Chernomyrdin wins Duma confirmation as prime minister. It
also seemed unlikely that Yeltsin would leave office before his
scheduled summit with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The United States urged Russia's new government not to abandon
pro-market economic reforms and to move quickly to stabilize its
battered economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it changed course in any kind of fundamental way that would
be a serious concern to us,'' Clinton's National Security Adviser
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Yeltsin would be in his offices there on Friday
where he is scheduled to meet with the visiting Bulgarian
president. Yeltsin also will hold consultations with Chernomyrdin
on the political and economic crisis, and with acting Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on the upcoming summit with Clinton.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Like a dowager in decline, Buffalo still has
good bones to remind people of her more prosperous and glamorous
days.
</P>
<P>
   Drive out Delaware Avenue, one of the fine boulevards radiating
from downtown. They were laid out by Joseph Ellicott, a brother of
Andrew Ellicott, Pierre L'Enfant's chief surveyor in the planning
of Washington. Look at the baronial manors that line it, like the
Williams-Butler Mansion at the corner of North Street. This is an
urban version by Stanford White of the castles his firm turned out
for the Vanderbilts in Newport and the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 19th century, when such houses were built, and early
in the 20th, when architects of genius like Frank Lloyd Wright
worked here, Buffalo was a city of burly self-confidence and
substantial riches, drawn from the great factories and steel mills
on its periphery. Grain elevators towered over its waterfront. An
outpost of the East and a gateway to the West, it was a
transportation hub, profiting from its privileged position at the
point where communication lines from New York City _ the Erie
Canal, which opened in 1825, and later the New York Central
Railroad _ reached the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the monumental Art Deco City Hall, John J.
Wade, said that it ``expresses primarily the masculinity, power and
purposeful energy of an industrial community.'' So it does, with
reliefs of toiling workers above columns resembling gigantic Roman
fasces. It also memorializes, with bronze statues at the facade's
corners, the two presidents who came from Buffalo, Millard Fillmore
and Grover Cleveland. Neither quite made the first team.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman said derisively of Fillmore: ``At a time when we
needed a strong man, we got a man who swayed with the slightest
breeze. About all he ever accomplished as president, he sent
Commodore Perry to open up Japan to the West, but that didn't help
much as far as preventing the Civil War was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt, a wholly different character, took the
presidential oath of office in Buffalo at the apogee of the city's
power in 1901, after William McKinley was assassinated while
opening the Pan-American Exposition. Only the Parthenon-like
headquarters of the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society
remains from the dozens of buildings built for the exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The city has changed swiftly in the last half-century. Most of
the mills have closed; the children and grandchildren of the
blue-collar workers who manned them are mostly white-collar
workers. The State University of New York at Buffalo, with two
campuses, is now the city's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 330,000, Buffalo remains the state's
second-largest city, but it is dwarfed by New York's 7.5 million.
And then there are the jokes about the snow; Buffalonians say
Rochester gets more, many years, but Buffalo gets the jokes, every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this remains a tightly knit, family-oriented, heavily Roman
Catholic community, still a rich ethnic stew of Polish-, Irish-,
Italian- and German-Americans. It is fiercely proud of its football
Bills and hockey Sabres,as well as Ani DiFranco, the punky pop
star who runs her own record company here. Buffalo stands apart,
less homogenized than many American cities. It eats hamburgers with
the rest of us, but also Ted's charcoal-grilled hot dogs and
Wardynski's kielbasa, Perry's ice cream and of course Buffalo
chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   Every block or so has its tavern, with a fish fry on Friday
night, and people tend to identify themselves by their parish. Ask
them where they live, and they answer, St. Monica's, or Holy
Family, or St. Stanislaus.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Russert, a native son and the anchor of ``Meet the Press''
on NBC, is Buffalo's booster in chief. He boasts about the Bills,
when they're winning, about the city's five lovely parks designed
by Frederick Law Olmsted, and about the accomplishments of people
like Peter Crotty, the state and local Democratic leader who helped
make John F. Kennedy president and Robert F. Kennedy a senator.
Crotty lived all his adult life in the same simple South Buffalo
house, a self-taught scholar of Latin who liked to read ``The
Aeneid'' in his basement library.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, Buffalo owes a huge debt to the discerning eye and
open wallet of a dynamo named Seymour H. Knox, universally known as
Shorty. Thanks largely to him, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery houses
one of the nation's best collections of modern art. It has two
buildings, a Greek revival temple whose design derives from that of
the Erechtheum on the Acropolis, with caryatids carved by no less
than Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and a sleek International Style
addition by Gordon Bunshaft, a Buffalo native famous for Lever
House in Manhattan.

 BUFFALO, N.Y.: in Manhattan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Albright-Knox's collections date back to the cycladic era,
but it excels in European and American painting of this century.
Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock are represented among artists from
this side of the Atlantic, along with many others, and from the Old
World, stars like Max Beckmann and Henri Matisse, whose quickly
brushed ``Glimpse of Notre-Dame in the Late Afternoon'' is one of
my favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Other museums can match such canvases, but only Buffalo has a
roomful of the jagged, vividly colored pictures of the reclusive,
inadequately celebrated Clyfford Still, who gave the Albright-Knox
no fewer than 31 works.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities have been missed in Buffalo. It is cut off for the
most part from Lake Erie, by expressways and industrial jungles,
taking far less advantage of the water's scenic and recreational
potential than Chicago, with its parks, piers and beaches along
Lake Michigan. But Buffalo has an even longer history of
architectural distinction than Chicago; you could do worse than
take it as a textbook for a course in modern American buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hobson Richardson, the great forerunner of the modern
movement, built his first neo-Romanesque building in Buffalo. It is
a vast mental hospital, now called the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,
with a pair of rusticated, chateaulike sandstone towers at its
center. A series of pavilions is linked to them and to one another
by curving passageways that can be sealed off in the event of fire
or other disturbance _ an early example of form following function.
Even in its current shabby state, this is a building of real
magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the pantheon comes Louis Sullivan, and he is
significantly represented in Buffalo, too. With his partner,
Dankmar Adler, he designed the Guaranty Building, the first
skyscraper entitled, in my view, to be called a masterpiece. With
the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, it is one of only two
surviving Sullivan skyscrapers, and it would have been lost were it
not for the labors of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Completed in
1896, it is a century old, but it looks as fresh as the day after
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Its frame is steel, but every square inch of the exterior is
covered with Sullivan's foliate ornamentation, executed in ocher
terra-cotta so that the building ``reads'' from a distance as
stone. The filigree reaches a climax at the corners atop the
13-story structure, which is capped with a row of oculi and a flat,
overhanging roof. Inside, much of the vibrant decor has been
preserved _ the intricate metalwork of the elevator cages, door
handles and balusters; the mosaics, the crisp lighting fixtures and
an exquisite stained-glass skylight. How could anyone have thought
of tearing it down?
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's protege and onetime draftsman, Frank Lloyd Wright,
left the most distinctive architectural mark on this city: five
houses, with a sixth nearby. But his greatest Buffalo project, the
Larkin administration building, a looming, almost unadorned
structure finished in 1906, was demolished only 44 years later. It
had the stark, geometric power of the churches in Santa Fe and
Taos. Today, it is universally considered one of the landmarks in
modern industrial architecture, along with the equally massive AEG
building by Peter Behrens in Berlin. Its soaring atrium, central if
rudimentary air-conditioning system and metal office furniture were
decades ahead of their time.
</P>
<P>
   All of Wright's residential work in the area, which remains
standing, was commissioned by people with a connection to the
Larkin Company, then a flourishing mail-order firm. The William R.
Heath house, built for a Larkin vice president, strikes me as
forbiddingly fortress-like, especially when compared with the Robie
House in Chicago, for which it was a kind of prototype. But no such
criticism can be leveled at the houses clustered in the Parkside
section, near the Buffalo zoo (a rather cramped place, which
nonetheless boasts an animated group of gorillas and spectacular
snow leopards).
</P>
<P>
   The Walter V. Davidson House, commissioned by a junior Larkin
executive, shows what Wright could do on a relatively limited
budget, using stucco instead of brick or stone and clear instead of
stained glass. For the nearby Darwin D. Martin complex, now being
restored after long periods of neglect, the sky was obviously the
financial limit. The main house is a large, splendidly horizontal
affair, with terraces, elongated urns, deeply overhanging roofs and
interior spaces that flow seamlessly into one another; it is much
the best example of the Prairie Style outside the Midwest. A
pergola, now lost, connected it to other buildings, notably a trim
little gardener's cottage and the subtly cruciform George Barton
house, which was built for Darwin Martin's sister and her husband,
who, like Martin, worked for Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Graycliff, a summer house that sits on a cliff above Lake Erie,
in the town of Derby, south of Buffalo, was yet another Martin
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was also connected, through his marriage to the writer
and philosopher Elbert Hubbard's sister, to Hubbard's Roycroft
community at East Aurora, half an hour east of Buffalo. This was a
semi-Utopian Arts and Crafts colony that for a time rivaled Gustav
Stickley as a producer of furniture, metalwork and other decorative
arts. The handsome Roycroft Inn, built to house visitors to the
community, has been faithfully restored, down to the last carpet
and table lamp, and it is once again operating as a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the buildings that have gone up in Buffalo in the last 75
years, the most influential by far is the Kleinhans Music Hall,
designed by the father-and-son team of Eliel and Eero Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks back to the elder Saarinen's Romantic Revival buildings
in Finland, like the Helsinki railway station, and, especially in
the airy interior, forward to the younger Saarinen's sweeping
curves in the TWA building at Kennedy Airport in New York City and
the terminal at Dulles Airport in Washington. The acoustics
approach perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the main tenant in the
Kleinhans hall, has been skating along the edge of bankruptcy in
recent years; its players even advertised, a few years back, for
another city to adopt it. That was quite a comedown for an ensemble
whose music directors have included Josef Krips, William Steinberg,
Julius Rudel and the composer Lukas Foss, a champion of innovative
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Theater has done a lot better, and by next spring, residents and
visitors alike will be able to see mega-musicals on a new stage of
Shea's Performing Arts Center, which is built around an ornate old
movie palace. For roughly half the year, Buffalo can also profit
from the excellent George Bernard Shaw Festival at nearby
Niagara-on-the-Lake in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   This year's edition, running from April 15 to Nov. 1, features
Shaw's ``Major Barbara'' and John Galsworthy's ``Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime attraction for visitors to the Buffalo area is, of
course, Niagara Falls, half an hour north by freeway. The world has
been beating a path to the falls for more than two centuries;
Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's nephew, took his bride there in 1803,
establishing a tradition. These days, 10 million visitors a year
come to view the spectacle of billions of gallons of gray-green
water crashing over a precipice that extends for 3,600 feet, in two
parts _ the American Falls on the United States side and the
spectacular Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.
</P>
<P>
   Some are impressed, some aren't. Henry James called the falls
``the most beautiful object in the world,'' but Oscar Wilde
dismissed them as ``the second most disappointing experience of
American married life.'' The point is, both made the trip, and so
should you, if you get as close as Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   You can view the cataracts from the Skylon, a tower on the
Canadian side; from the Maid of the Mist, a little boat that bobs
in the spray underneath, and from the Cave of the Winds walk along
the base of the cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   But for my money the best vantage point is Queen Victoria Park,
also on the Canadian side, where you can stroll in bountiful,
immaculately kept gardens directly opposite the falls. They look
close enough to reach out and get your finger wet.

 BUFFALO, N.Y.: innovative programs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A BUFFALO VISITOR'S PRIMER
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting Buffalo, N.Y., along with
travel and lodging tips:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   HYATT REGENCY, 2 Fountain Plaza, Pearl and Huron Streets, (716)
856-1234. In the thick of things downtown, a block or two from
theaters, this is the city's best hotel. It is also a useful piece
of urban recycling, combining a modern glass atrium, something of a
Hyatt hallmark, with a building dating from 1923. Three bars and
two restaurants produce a fair amount of hubbub. Weekend rate: $85
a night, single or double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM'S MARK, 120 Church St., (716) 845-5100. Until a few months
ago, this was a Hilton; its name and ownership have changed, and it
will get a major face lift starting later this year. With 475 rooms
and suites, it is Buffalo's largest hotel, overlooking the
waterfront at the point where the Niagara River flows into Lake
Erie. Fine health facilities, including six indoor tennis courts.
Weekend rate: $99 a night, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIOTT, 1340 Millersport Highway, Amherst, (716) 689-6900.
Location, location, location _ in this case a few minutes from the
airport, on the way to Niagara Falls and not too far from downtown
Buffalo. The rooms are cookie-cutter specials, though adequate
enough. Welcome features are a year-round indoor-outdoor pool and a
garden courtyard overflowing with summer bloom. Weekend rate: $109
to $119 a night, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOR BAR, 1047 Main St., (716) 886-8920. Frank and Teressa's
Anchor Bar remains unchanged, a dingy neighborhood tavern where
most of the food is eminently forgettable and the chicken wings,
invented here, are immortal. Well, almost. They deep-fry them on
command, a minimum of 10 to an order, which is plenty for a snack
for two. Pay your $5.65 and marvel at the improbably habit-forming
qualities of these chubby chicken chunks nestling in a puddle of
hot sauce, with celery sticks and Roquefort dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ENCHANTE, 16 Allen St., (716) 885-1330. In a bohemian
neighborhood called Allentown, near downtown, Enchante serves a
modest lunch that reminds you why the French still rule the
culinary roost. Alain Jorand's menu and decor are a little faded,
but what counts is what's on the plate. Trained by Gerard Boyer,
the great three-star chef in Champagne, he makes a sinful
vichyssoise, using both the green and white parts of leeks, and
other satisfying dishes.
</P>
<P>
   FRITZ, 6010 Goodrich Road, Clarence Center, (716) 741-5085.
Easily the best restaurant in the area, this is the creation of
Joerg Fritz Goeing, a onetime cruise-ship steward from northern
Germany who met and married, Love Boat style, a young woman from
Buffalo. The setting is cool, blond, clean-cut; the food is
Pacific-influenced. Try the steamed clams with Thai spices or the
tuna California rolls with sesame seeds and a cantaloupe and
cucumber salsa.
</P>
<P>
   HUTCH'S, 1375 Delaware Ave., near Gates Circle, (716) 885-0074.
Every Friday and Saturday night, they run 200 or more people
through this bubbling bistro, with paper table coverings and Thonet
chairs, and everyone eats well. The rib-eye steak rubbed with
garlic, stuffed poblano chiles, dark-hued french fries and tuna are
all exemplary. There is swift service from waiters in long white
aprons, and check the wine prices: 1995 Ridge Zinfandel Pagani
Ranch, $37.
</P>
<P>
   SCHWABL'S, 789 Center Road, West Seneca, (716) 674-9821.
Schwabl's makes one of the great sandwiches in America _ beef
sliced thinly from a steamship round when you order it, piled on a
round roll studded with caraway seeds and pretzel salt, moistened
with natural juices and perked up, if you like, with a smear of
horseradish and a Molson's on draft. They call it beef on weck
(short for ``kuemmelweck''), and it's well worth the drive from
downtown Buffalo, or Toronto, for that matter. The family has been
in the business since 1837.
</P>
<P>
   MING TEH, 126 Niagara Boulevard, Fort Erie, Ontario, (905)
871-7971. Across the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, this Chinese
restaurant serves Beijing, Cantonese and Szechuan dishes. Gaudily
ugly outside, understatedly modern inside, it faces the
swift-flowing Niagara River, where you can watch the speedboats
dart past on summer evenings. Our pickled Szechuan cabbage soup
with pork, tangy steamed vegetarian dumplings and chewy dry-fried
beef strips with ginger and garlic were all subtle and complex.
Sweet but disorganized service. Architecture
</P>
<P>

Several times a year the garden is open to the public for charity

PREVIEW OF UPCOMING FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, the traditionalists tell us, the time of frivolity and
carefree film-going comes to an end as summer ebbs, and serious
viewing begins as the days grow shorter. Yeah, which is why there
are two cartoons this fall about ants and one about a guy who dies,
comes back as a snowman and learns what it means to be a real
father. That one must be based on the Jane Austen novel.

previewed are not yet firmly set.

HENRY HYDE WOULD LEAD ANY IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BY THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Congress ends up launching an impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton's behavior, the spotlight would
focus intently on Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the portly chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee and one of the senior statesmen of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, 74, a 23-year House veteran whose district is clustered
around O'Hare airport in Chicago's western suburbs, gets first
crack at the long-anticipated report of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr on President Clinton's conduct in the Whitewater and Monica
Lewinsky matters. The report is expected on Capitol Hill next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is gearing up already, with both Republicans and
Democrats hiring lawyers and staff in case the House decides to
trigger the constitutional machinery that could remove a president
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Although any such proceedings are almost guaranteed to be
fraught with razor-edged partisanship, there's widespread agreement
among Democrats and Republicans that if anyone can bring a sense of
decorum and common purpose to this process, it is Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man for all seasons, particularly this season, because
he has transcended partisan politics,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, a Judiciary Committee member. ``I think he'll be a
unifier, not a divider.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, while not relishing the prospect of delving further
into Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky, believe Hyde is
their best hope for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman has made great efforts to avoid charges of
partisanship,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also a Judiciary
Committee member. ``I think he's eager to come out of whatever
happens with the country saying `Good job, Henry.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 6'3'' with considerable girth and a grandfatherly mane of
white hair, Hyde is the gentle giant of the House's conservative
leadership. He is best known for his staunch opposition to abortion
and sponsorship of the 1976 Hyde Amendment restricting federal
expenditures for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also is an implacable foe of gay rights, having steered the
1996 Defense of Marriage Act through the Judiciary Committee. The
law allows states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed in
other states, and defines marriage as something reserved for men
and women in terms of awarding federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde does not always walk in lock step with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and the other GOP conservatives. For example, he
opposes term limits, which he calls the ``dumbing down of
democracy.'' Hyde also opposes repeal of the assault weapon ban,
saying he doesn't want ``the kid next door having a flame thrower
or a Gatling gun.''
</P>
<P>
   As stridently conservative as he is on some issues, friends and
colleagues in both parties say he manages to put forward his views
with aplomb and humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares fervently about a number of issues, but the reason we
all admire him is that he manages to deal strongly with these
issues, but seldom offends anybody,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde would need all these assets to guide his contentious
committee, if it is tasked to explore whether to recommend that the
full House consider impeachment. Panel members range from Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., who first called for Clinton's impeachment in November
1997 three months before Lewinsky leaped into the national
limelight, to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the committee's senior
Democrat whose verbal assaults regularly sting Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Abner Mikva, former Clinton White House counsel and federal
judge who befriended Hyde when both represented Chicago-area House
districts in the 1970s, called Hyde an ``institutionalist'' eager
to see that the presidency _ and Congress itself _ come through any
scandal as unsullied as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry is a partisan, a conservative rock-ribbed Republican,''
Mikva said. ``On the issues, I expect that he and Bill Clinton
couldn't be further apart. But this is an institutional problem.
Henry realizes that if it comes before Congress, hard as it is, the
partisan concerns should be put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's style contrasts sharply with that of Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., the caustic chairman of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee who referred to President Clinton as a
``scumbag'' in a newspaper interview earlier this year. Burton's
continuing probe of campaign finance irregularities in the 1996
election has made little progress amid partisan crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, by contrast, is a nice guy from Chicago who grew up in a
household so poor that the family subsisted on chop suey. The Hydes
were devout Catholics. His father worked for the telephone company,
collecting nickels from pay phones and his mother read St. Thomas
Aquinas.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde interrupted his career as a basketball star at Georgetown
University to serve in the Navy in the South Pacific during World
War II. He married his Georgetown girlfriend, Jeanne Simpson, in
1947 and they had three sons and a daughter. She died of cancer in
1992, a loss that remains palpable for Hyde, according to friends.
</P>
<P>
   He received his law degree from Loyola University in Chicago in
1949, worked as a defense lawyer, and served in the Illinois
General Assembly from 1967 to 1974. It was there that he began his
personal crusade against abortion after a colleague tried enlisting
him as a co-sponsor of an abortion rights law.
</P>
<P>
   He won his seat in Congress in November 1974, three months after
President Richard M. Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal.
Twenty-four years later, Hyde finds himself on the brink of a
similar whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr hands over his report to Congress, the House
Judiciary Committee would investigate, hold hearings and ultimately
decide whether to recommend impeachment. If the panel makes such a
recommendation, the full House then would vote on impeachment,
which is an accusation similar to an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The issue would move to a trial in the Senate where House
Judiciary Committee members would prosecute and the president could
field his own defense team. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would
be the judge. The jury would be the 100 senators. A two-thirds vote
is needed for conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1868, the House moved to impeach President Andrew Johnson,
but the Senate fell short of the two-thirds majority necessary to
convict and expel him.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1974, the Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of
Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., voted on bills of impeachment against
Nixon. On Aug. 8, Nixon announced his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Rodino, according to Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution,
had come to the chairmanship strictly through seniority and was not
particularly known for his adroit leadership skills. Nevertheless,
he showed great ingenuity in forging a consensus that ultimately
pushed Nixon out of office, thus avoiding the ordeal of a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder now because you have sharp-tongued ideological
members on both sides and the media in general gives politicians
less breathing room,'' Hess said. ``The whole scene is more
cynical, so there is less reason to expect (a bipartisan solution).
But I expect if it does happen, it will be because of Henry Hyde.''

MORE INTIMATE THAN A MUSEUM: AN ARTIST'S HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Artists' houses. You have to love them. Otherwise, these
valuable three-dimensional documents can sink into oblivion and be
lost forever. Indeed, love may be the primary ingredient in any
preservation effort, the emotional trigger by which the present
reconstitutes the past as a gift for the future.
</P>
<P>
   This thought comes repeatedly, and sometimes sadly, to mind when
one visits some of the artists' houses that lie within a half-day's
drive of New York City, along either side of the Hudson and in
Massachusetts. The artists who inhabited, and occasionally built or
altered, these structures range from Hudson River School stars like
Frederic Edwin Church and Jasper Cropsey, both of whom died in
1900, to the 20th-century American modernists Suzy Frelinghuysen
and George L.K. Morris, whose International Style country house and
studio in Lenox, Mass., opened for tours only last month. Also
included is the home of Thomas Cole (1801-1848), the founding
spirit of the Hudson River School, which has been decaying for
several years, shuttered and neglected where it sits in Catskill,
N.Y., but whose fortunes are on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   These homes provide valuable insights into their inhabitants'
quirks, sensibilities and achievements, and illuminates as well the
architecture, taste and living conditions of their time (and to
some extent their class). Plus, each house comes with its
preservation saga, one usually initiated by one determined
individual _ often a descendant of the artist _ and carried forth
against heavy odds, sometimes with tragic losses of material.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the big picture can be equally valuable, and sobering or
thrilling, for anyone interested in architectural or artistic
preservation. Each house represents different levels of financing,
attention and understanding, a degree and kind of love measured in
physical condition and intellectual coherence, and some remind us
that love can be blind when genuine vision is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   The parts of this picture are arranged in neither chronological
nor geographical order, but according to the substantialness of the
houses and in an effort to bring both their lessons and their
pleasures into sharper relief.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest triumph of artist's-house salvation , because it is
the most complete, is fittingly also the greatest artistic
achievement in the group: Frederic Edwin Church's magical,
magnificent Olana, a Victorian-Moorish fantasy perched high above
the Hudson a few miles south of Hudson, N.Y. The views from Olana's
grounds, towers, porches and windows are among the most spectacular
along the Hudson, or any river. Still, inside and out, the house
withstands the challenge spectacularly. And it seems to have been
blessed with a fierce guardian, Church, the artist's
daughter-in-law, who lived out her widowhood at Olana, dying in
1963. Apparently, she never moved a thing in the lavishly appointed
ground-floor rooms, the artist's studio included.
</P>
<P>
   Made wealthy by the success of his dramatic panoramic paintings
of the Andes and Niagara Falls, which thousands of people paid to
see, Church was drawn back to the Hudson Valley just before his
marriage to Isabel Carnes, in 1860. He purchased a 126-acre farm,
whose topography he already knew and loved. From its various high
points, he had sketched and painted the surrounding landscape with
Thomas Cole, whose home lay directly across the river. (The
precocious Church was Cole's only student, studying with him in
1844 and '45.)
</P>
<P>
   Living first in a smaller cottage, Church began planning a
hilltop in the mid-1860s. But in 1865, he and his wife went abroad
for 18 months to recover from the sudden deaths of their two young
children from diptheria. They visited England, savoring the sober
decorativeness of the Esthetic Movement, and then the Middle East,
where they became entranced by Persian culture. They returned home
with a completely different concept for their new house.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Morris Hunt, who had drawn up the initial plans, was
replaced by Calvert Vaux. And Vaux was soon relegated to overseeing
structural and engineering matters while Church designed the house
and, with Isabel, decorated its elaborate interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Squarish, with a robust Italianate tower rising from one corner,
the house has great bones. To this austere structure, Church added
key-hole archways and windows, a smaller tower and turret, and
eventually a new studio, all pulled together by borders of
decorative brickwork, tile and polychrome wood, sometimes in
relief. At once massive and delicate, the result conjures up a
mosque, a citadel and a summer palace that is also clearly the work
of a painter. Inside, the decorated borders, usually stenciled,
continue to mesmerizing effect around moldings and across doors,
unifying rooms that change from green to yellow to salmon _
perfect-pitch tones that Church mixed on his palette.
</P>
<P>
   The colors and borders also bring coherence to a mind-boggling
range of furniture, art and decorative objects from around the
world _ a Japanese Buddha, Chinese porcelains, copies of mosque
candle lanterns, Turkish rugs and kilims. These are mixed with
Church's paintings and those of his contemporaries, usually
landscapes keyed to the real landscapes framed by every window. The
totality is surprisingly tranquil and harmonious, as if Church had
translated his penchant for universalizing the natural landscape
into a deftly orchestrated celebration of world cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York state refused to accept Olana as a bequest
from its last occupant, it was rescued from the brink of auction by
a group led by the artist's biographer, David Huntington, which
included Philip Johnson, Lincoln Kirstein and Edgar Kaufman Jr.
They knew that Olana and its grounds, on which Church lavished
equal attention, were the artist's final and possibly his greatest
work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey's Ever Rest
</P>
<P>
   If Olana is the blazing jewel in the crown of artists' houses,
Jasper Cropsey's Ever Rest, a yellow-and-white gingerbread cottage
in Hastings-on-Hudson, is a lustrous little gem that has recently
been given a somewhat awkward setting. This setting is the
Newington-Cropsey Foundation Gallery of Art and Cultural Studies
Center, which opened on adjacent property in 1994 in a sprawling
yellow-and-white, Palladian-style villa.
</P>
<P>
   The Newington-Cropsey Foundation, which is headed by Barbara
Newington, Cropsey's great-granddaughter, seems to exemplify that
is at least partly blind. Mrs. Newington and her husband deserve
incalculable credit for reassembling an enormous collection of
Cropsey's paintings, watercolors and drawings over the last 45
years. Together with archives maintained by the family since
Cropsey's death, these artworks form an extraordinarily complete
repository that will undoubtably benefit Cropsey scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   But everything about the new building seems garishly
inappropriate and amateurish, starting with the overwrought, badly
scaled architecture. The central double-height gallery, based on
the Pantheon, includes a staircase fit for a scene in ``Gone With
the Wind.'' And Cropsey's paintings are skied, poorly lighted,
unlabeled and, worst of all, appear to have been vigorously
overcleaned to a harsh, uniform brightness.
</P>
<P>
   The art is much more at home, and is far easier to see, at the
Cropsey homestead, which he bought in 1885 and lived in for five
years, until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey, four years younger than Church, lacked the latter's
sense of spiritual drama and sweeping, eye-of-God perspectives.
Influenced by Constable, Cropsey was an earthier, more prosaic
painter, more likely than Church to include everyday signs of
domestic life and modern progress _ farms, grazing cows, villages,
trains and bridges _ in his elegantly worked paintings, which
reflect a special talent for portraying the glowing colors of
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   And while Church backed into architecture, discovering a new
outlet for his visionary impulses, Cropsey trained as an architect
and frequently worked as one even after his focus changed to
painting. His architectural credits include several Manhattan
brownstones, the 14th Street subway station for the old Sixth
Avenue el and the Moravian Church on Staten Island. (The most
informative display at the gallery is a small room devoted to his
architectural renderings.)
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey may also have built his own Olana, a 37-room
Elizabethan-Tudor mansion and studio in Warwick, N.Y., which he
named Aladdin. He was forced to sell it in 1884, after the Hudson
River School fell out of favor and his fortunes slumped; it burned
to the ground a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ever Rest, a relatively modest board-and-batten house built in
1830 to which Cropsey added a studio that he designed, is a
pleasure. It has a breathtaking view of the Hudson and is
chockablock with furniture and objects acquired by succeeding
Cropseys. Also on view are several pieces of furniture designed by
the artist; his palette, brushes and portable easel; the dress suit
he wore when presented to Queen Victoria, and a series of small
studies depicting the Battle of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   The work lining the walls of Ever Rest forms a veritable Cropsey
retrospective, with the small oil studies and dozens of fine small
drawings as standouts. And the large studio is especially dramatic:
a grand, medieval banquet hall of a room lined with elaborate
paneling and crowned with a cupola whose windows open with pulleys.
An easel displays the artist's last work, an unfinished portrait of
his wife. A small watercolor reveals that the studio is almost an
exact replica of the one that Cropsey built at Aladdin.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's Locust Grove
</P>
<P>
   Locust Grove, the sprawling gentleman's estate farm that the
painter-turned-inventor Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791-1872)
purchased in 1847, is also a repository for art and furniture
acquired by several generations of inhabitants. It is much more of
a composite than Cropsey's Ever Rest, in part because Morse's life
and career were peripatetic _ he abandoned painting after it failed
to support him _ and in part because his children sold the house in
1901. Its new owner was William Young, whose daughter Annette lived
in the house until she died in 1975 and endowed a small trust to
maintain the estate as a historic site.
</P>
<P>
   The Youngs were sensitive to the Morse connection, retaining
some of his furniture and purchasing a few paintings by him (the
house also contains a model of the original telegraph). But they
were also inveterate collectors, especially of furniture, filling
the house with acquisitions that ranged from the 1700s to the late
19th century. The house is an amazingly crowded pastiche of
artifacts _ a Dutch marquetry bedroom set here, an Empire
gentleman's chest there, various pieces of Chippendale, numerous
grandfather clocks and even an Elizabethan Revival dining room set.
</P>
<P>
   In its profusion and disorder, Locust Grove is something of the
``Un-Olana,'' and what the public sees is only the tip of the
iceberg of decorative arts holdings. A new visitors' center, under
construction near the edge of the site, promises to be sympathetic
and unobtrusive. It may relieve some of the congestion, but the
current ambience of a large, high-end antiques store is not
altogether unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting aspect of the estate, aside from its
beautiful grounds, which Morse had a hand in planning, is the
house. It was Morse who enlarged and completely transformed it,
with the help of the architect Alexander Jackson Davis. The
original rectangular Federal structure was encased in an octagonal
Tuscan-style villa flanked by verandas, an arched porte-cochere on
one side and, on the other, a four-story tower with breathtaking
views of the Hudson. It is a graceful if subtly mongrel structure,
unfazed by the Youngs' addition of a dining and bedroom wing in
place of one of the verandas.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edward Hopper House Art Center
</P>
<P>
   Hopper House, in Nyack, N.Y., is an example of the artist's
house as empty vessel _ one that, as these things go, was never
very full. Built in 1858 by his maternal grandfather, the clapboard
two-story house was Edward Hopper's birthplace and childhood home.
He left it in 1906 at age 24 and never lived there again, although
he retained title to the house and his sister lived there until her
death in 1965. But Hopper visited Nyack regularly and the area's
storefronts and houses appear in a few of his paintings. At his
death, in 1967, he was buried in Nyack's Oak Hill Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper House is a shoestring, grass-roots operation. Slated for
demolition in 1970, it was saved by local residents who formed the
Edward Hopper Landmark Preservation Foundation, solicited donations
and donated time and expertise to its restoration. Today it is a
cultural center, holding exhibitions, drawing classes and concerts;
its upstairs rooms are rented as offices. One small room is devoted
to Hopper's life and work, but it contains none of his art and,
except for an austere settee, no Hopper family furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to enter this green-shuttered white house, with its tall
French windows overlooking the Hudson, wide bare floorboards and
airy, high-ceilinged rooms, is to come under a spell that can be
described only as Hopperesque. The house is the modest prototype of
the austere white houses that Hopper turned into icons of
small-town America. Even the emptiness of the rooms seems to echo
the sparse interiors and emotional isolation of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprisingly affecting to see the point of origin of this
motif, and this mood. It resonates throughout Hopper's sensibility,
and gives the house its own kind of fullness.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Historic Landmark
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cole's yellow-and-white home, which overlooks the
Catksill Mountains, not the Hudson, as is often supposed, is an
instance of artist's-house purgatory. Although Cole inhabited it
for only the last 12 years of his life, his descendants occupied it
until the early 1960s, preserving much of his art and many of his
belongings. They even went so far as to block a proposed approach
to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge that would have required moving or
demolishing the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cole house received National Landmark status in
1965, it was refused as a gift by New York state. Emptied of its
contents in a heartbreaking auction, in which large paintings by
Cole sold for less than $1,000, the house was finally purchased by
a well-meaning group headed by the New York art dealer Ira
Spanierman. Calling itself the Thomas Cole Foundation, this hastily
assembled body ultimately lacked the money to keep the house open
or even to maintain it properly.
</P>
<P>
   But a happy ending may be in sight. In recent weeks, the Greene
County Historical Society, which bought some Cole items at the
auction, signed a contract to purchase the house from the
foundation. Management of the house will be overseen by a separate
board of directors, headed by Robert Stackman. A state grant has
been received for exterior repairs; a federal grant and affiliation
with the National Park Service may soon be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board does not expect to be able to reconstitute
more than a few rooms with displays of art and objects original to
the house during Cole's time, it says the house will be open in
time for Greene County's bicentennial celebration in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen Morris House
</P>
<P>
   With the house and studio of Suzy Frelinghuysen (1911-1988) and
George L.K. Morris (1905-1975), the 19th century gives way to the
20th, nature takes a backseat to culture and abstraction, and white
stucco and glass brick prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen and Morris, both from wealthy families who
encouraged their interests in art and music, married in 1934. A
devout abstractionist, founding member of the American Abstract
Artists and, later, an editor and art critic at Partisan Review,
Morris rekindled his wife's childhood interest in painting. By the
early '40s, they were known as the ``Park Avenue Cubists,'' along
with A.E. Gallatin and Charles Shaw, two other abstract painters of
independent means.
</P>
<P>
   Morris built the Bauhaus-inspired house on his family's Lenox,
Mass., estate in the early 1940s, working with the Stockbridge
architect John Butler Swann. He linked it to a studio that he had
built in 1930 that was based on the Paris studio of Le Corbusier,
with whom he had studied. The blazing white (recently repainted)
compound formed by these buildings has a nautical, Art Deco glamour
suitable to Nick and Nora Charles. There is a sunken bar underneath
the spiral stairs in the foyer and, instead of Asta, a pug named
Miss Rose once waited by the front door. But there is also a
well-chosen collection of works by Picasso, Gris, Miro, Leger,
Matisse, Braque and Helion, and Nonobjective fresco murals by the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Morris painted the ones in the house's courtyard, curving
stairway and living room. Frelinghuysen held forth in the dining
room, with bold Synthetic Cubist compositions in a signature
palette of blue, soft chartreuse and black. While her best efforts
are often more satisfying than Morris' more cerebral works, she
clearly took things less seriously, painting her bedroom with a
frothy landscape and quoting Mantegna on the ceiling, while he
created handsome wood and bakelite wall reliefs for his bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which was established in Frelinghuysen's will,
is overseen by her nephew, the artist T. Kinney Frelinhuysen, who
prepared the house for public display, while also managing to leave
it much as it was.
</P>
<P>
   As the visitor departs through the woods surrounding the house,
past a large reclining nude by Gaston Lachaise, an interesting
question takes shape: How many houses of 20th-century American
artists have already been lost to posterity, and how many will soon
be in danger?

ANTIQUES: PAPERWEIGHTS _ BEAUTY PLAYS ALL THE ANGLES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do President Clinton, King Farouk, Eva Peron,
Colette and Truman Capote all have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They all collected glass paperweights. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of glass paperweights is as practical as it is
esthetic. Alan Kaplan, the son of a longtime Manhattan antiques
dealer, Leo Kaplan, is only half joking when he asks: ``What other
kind of art is as easy to maintain? All it takes is Windex or
vinegar and water. Glass paperweights don't break easily, and they
are fake free.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count, Leo Kaplan, whose antique shop is at 967 Madison
Ave., at 75th Street, had 350 antique glass paperweights for sale
at $250 to $80,000 apiece. It has all kinds of weights:
19th-century Bohemian examples, pieces from the top French glass
houses like Baccarat, Clichy and Saint Louis, and specimens from
England and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But fake-free? Perhaps to experts like the Kaplans. The rest of
us need professional guidance or a lot of study. This will be
possible soon, when Christie's previews its sale of the Homer G.
Perkins collection of glass paperweights in Los Angeles from Sept.
12-14 and in New York from Sept. 19-22. The auction will be held in
New York at Christie's on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, a former president of the Paperweight Collectors'
Association, a group with chapters all over the world, is selling
his second collection of weights. He sold the first in 1981. ``With
that accomplished, I thought I was cured,'' he said, ``but it was
not to be.'' He started buying them again two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 180 lots in the sale are weights with flowers, swirls,
overlays, reptiles and butterflies. Among the rarest examples is a
Baccarat garlanded engraved horse similar to the one sold by the
New-York Historical Society at Sotheby's on Jan. 18, 1995, in a
sale which set the record ($1,503,768) for a paperweight auction.
That horse sold for $40,250, a record for a Baccarat equestrian
weight sold at auction. It had a pre-sale estimate of $15,000 to
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christie's sale, the popular favorite among
nonspecialists will probably be the Gila monster weight made by
Pantin, a French factory. It has a black reptile with orange
markings crawling under green plants with yellow flowers (yellow
flowers are the rarest color, according to Alan Kaplan). It has a
low estimate ($3,000 to $4,000) because it has a crack, but it may
well appeal to boys of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   The history of glass paperweights is short. French glassmakers
evidently got the idea to make paperweights after attending the
Austrian Industrial Fair in Vienna in 1845. At the fair, a Murano
glassworker, Pietro Bigaglia, displayed his Venetian wares. A 1975
book, ``Paperweights for Collectors,'' by Lawrence H. Selman and
Linda Pope-Selman, relates that a few of those weights, bearing the
initials BP, have survived. ``They are usually abstract in
design,'' the authors write, ``containing bits and pieces of
colored glass rods and occasionally silhouette canes representing
famous people, gondolas, or initials.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Bigaglia examples were the inspiration, the French
houses of Baccarat, Clichy and Saint Louis suddenly began making
fine glass paperweights. The golden age of paperweights was 1845 to
1860. Soon English factories also began producing paperweights, at
Stourbridge in the Midlands and George Bacchus &AMP; Sons at
Birmingham. As Melissa J. Bennie, the Christie's expert on
paperweights, pointed out, ``The English shapes are usually
different; each company had its own distinctive molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Paul Hollister, has written that the English
weights were more pastel and brighter in color than ones in France
and ``were for the most part uninspired.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Boston &AMP; Sandwich Glass Co., Gillinder &AMP;
Sons, Mt. Washington and the New England Glass Company also began
making weights after the 1850s. But as the 20th century approached,
paperweights were no longer fashionable, and fewer were made. Today
most collectors buy weights made in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing variety of styles is documented in ``The Collector's
Dictionary of Glass'' (1961), by E.M. Elville. The most
recognizable weights are called millefiori (thousand flowers),
decorative glass made by fusing glass rods of different shapes and
colors that are then thinly sliced in cross sections. A lot of
weights, including some millefiori, depict flowers, fruit, animals,
reptiles and human figures. Sulphide weights incorporate medallions
or portraits, made of a porcelainlike substance, that usually
portray famous figures like Napoleon or the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The antique-paperweight market goes through cycles. After a
lull, it is heating up again. ``There's a strong collecting group
out there right now,'' Ms. Bennie said, ``and new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Stair, a former dealer who consults at Christie's, said:
``Most of the new collectors are men _ doctors, industrialists,
movie directors _ interestingly enough. The market is wider than it
used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, according to Judy Murphy, the proprietor of Copley
South Antiques in Cape Neddick, Maine, is ``age and history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when most people's desks are covered with phones,
computers and mounds of paper,'' she said, ``it's nice to have
something not produced in the modern world.'' Mrs. Murphy is
selling a 19th-century English piece called an end-of-day
paperweight, made with leftover glass remnants swept up at the end
of the day. It costs $975.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Feingold, the owner of Gem Antiques at 1088 Madison Ave.,
at 82nd Street, has a lot of paperweights for sale. ``When I
started 30 years ago, the market was American,'' he said. ``Now I
sell to the Orient, Europe, South America and Mexico, even
Australia.'' His weights average $2,000 to $3,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Acevedo, owner of the Alexander Gallery at 942
Madison, at 74th Street, has been collecting weights since the
1960s. (He bought the rare black salamander at Sotheby's last April
29 for $160,000.) He tries to limit his collection to 30 pieces, so
he is constantly selling as he trades up. ``I had a field day for
years,'' he said. ``Until this year, I didn't have much
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly good paperweight collections can be seen at the
Corning Glass Museum in Corning, N.Y.; the Bergstrom-Mahler Museum
in Neenah, Wis., and the new Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art at
Ligonier Valley, in western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In Ligonier, the New York architect Michele Rudolph has invented
a new way to display paperweights, a spectacular paperweight wall
of glass that lets people see the weights from all angles. ``It was
inspired by Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum displays the collections of Walter Carlyle Shaw and
his daughter Elizabeth Shaw Gamble. Situated amid the horse farms
and golf courses of rural Ligonier, between Frank Lloyd Wright's
Falling Water and Pittsburgh, it is one of the country's most
beautifully sited museums.

<P>
   Artists' houses. You have to love them. Otherwise, these
valuable three-dimensional documents can sink into oblivion and be
lost forever. Indeed, love may be the primary ingredient in any
preservation effort, the emotional trigger by which the present
reconstitutes the past as a gift for the future.
</P>
<P>
   This thought comes repeatedly, and sometimes sadly, to mind when
one visits some of the artists' houses that lie within a half-day's
drive of New York City, along either side of the Hudson and in
Massachusetts. The artists who inhabited, and occasionally built or
altered, these structures range from Hudson River School stars like
Frederic Edwin Church and Jasper Cropsey, both of whom died in
1900, to the 20th-century American modernists Suzy Frelinghuysen
and George L.K. Morris, whose International Style country house and
studio in Lenox, Mass., opened for tours only last month. Also
included is the home of Thomas Cole (1801-1848), the founding
spirit of the Hudson River School, which has been decaying for
several years, shuttered and neglected where it sits in Catskill,
N.Y., but whose fortunes are on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   These homes provide valuable insights into their inhabitants'
quirks, sensibilities and achievements, and illuminates as well the
architecture, taste and living conditions of their time (and to
some extent their class). Plus, each house comes with its
preservation saga, one usually initiated by one determined
individual _ often a descendant of the artist _ and carried forth
against heavy odds, sometimes with tragic losses of material.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the big picture can be equally valuable, and sobering or
thrilling, for anyone interested in architectural or artistic
preservation. Each house represents different levels of financing,
attention and understanding, a degree and kind of love measured in
physical condition and intellectual coherence, and some remind us
that love can be blind when genuine vision is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   The parts of this picture are arranged in neither chronological
nor geographical order, but according to the substantialness of the
houses and in an effort to bring both their lessons and their
pleasures into sharper relief.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest triumph of artist's-house salvation , because it is
the most complete, is fittingly also the greatest artistic
achievement in the group: Frederic Edwin Church's magical,
magnificent Olana, a Victorian-Moorish fantasy perched high above
the Hudson a few miles south of Hudson, N.Y. The views from Olana's
grounds, towers, porches and windows are among the most spectacular
along the Hudson, or any river. Still, inside and out, the house
withstands the challenge spectacularly. And it seems to have been
blessed with a fierce guardian, Church, the artist's
daughter-in-law, who lived out her widowhood at Olana, dying in
1963. Apparently, she never moved a thing in the lavishly appointed
ground-floor rooms, the artist's studio included.
</P>
<P>
   Made wealthy by the success of his dramatic panoramic paintings
of the Andes and Niagara Falls, which thousands of people paid to
see, Church was drawn back to the Hudson Valley just before his
marriage to Isabel Carnes, in 1860. He purchased a 126-acre farm,
whose topography he already knew and loved. From its various high
points, he had sketched and painted the surrounding landscape with
Thomas Cole, whose home lay directly across the river. (The
precocious Church was Cole's only student, studying with him in
1844 and '45.)
</P>
<P>
   Living first in a smaller cottage, Church began planning a
hilltop in the mid-1860s. But in 1865, he and his wife went abroad
for 18 months to recover from the sudden deaths of their two young
children from diptheria. They visited England, savoring the sober
decorativeness of the Esthetic Movement, and then the Middle East,
where they became entranced by Persian culture. They returned home
with a completely different concept for their new house.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Morris Hunt, who had drawn up the initial plans, was
replaced by Calvert Vaux. And Vaux was soon relegated to overseeing
structural and engineering matters while Church designed the house
and, with Isabel, decorated its elaborate interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Squarish, with a robust Italianate tower rising from one corner,
the house has great bones. To this austere structure, Church added
key-hole archways and windows, a smaller tower and turret, and
eventually a new studio, all pulled together by borders of
decorative brickwork, tile and polychrome wood, sometimes in
relief. At once massive and delicate, the result conjures up a
mosque, a citadel and a summer palace that is also clearly the work
of a painter. Inside, the decorated borders, usually stenciled,
continue to mesmerizing effect around moldings and across doors,
unifying rooms that change from green to yellow to salmon _
perfect-pitch tones that Church mixed on his palette.
</P>
<P>
   The colors and borders also bring coherence to a mind-boggling
range of furniture, art and decorative objects from around the
world _ a Japanese Buddha, Chinese porcelains, copies of mosque
candle lanterns, Turkish rugs and kilims. These are mixed with
Church's paintings and those of his contemporaries, usually
landscapes keyed to the real landscapes framed by every window. The
totality is surprisingly tranquil and harmonious, as if Church had
translated his penchant for universalizing the natural landscape
into a deftly orchestrated celebration of world cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York state refused to accept Olana as a bequest
from its last occupant, it was rescued from the brink of auction by
a group led by the artist's biographer, David Huntington, which
included Philip Johnson, Lincoln Kirstein and Edgar Kaufman Jr.
They knew that Olana and its grounds, on which Church lavished
equal attention, were the artist's final and possibly his greatest
work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey's Ever Rest
</P>
<P>
   If Olana is the blazing jewel in the crown of artists' houses,
Jasper Cropsey's Ever Rest, a yellow-and-white gingerbread cottage
in Hastings-on-Hudson, is a lustrous little gem that has recently
been given a somewhat awkward setting. This setting is the
Newington-Cropsey Foundation Gallery of Art and Cultural Studies
Center, which opened on adjacent property in 1994 in a sprawling
yellow-and-white, Palladian-style villa.
</P>
<P>
   The Newington-Cropsey Foundation, which is headed by Barbara
Newington, Cropsey's great-granddaughter, seems to exemplify that
is at least partly blind. Mrs. Newington and her husband deserve
incalculable credit for reassembling an enormous collection of
Cropsey's paintings, watercolors and drawings over the last 45
years. Together with archives maintained by the family since
Cropsey's death, these artworks form an extraordinarily complete
repository that will undoubtably benefit Cropsey scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   But everything about the new building seems garishly
inappropriate and amateurish, starting with the overwrought, badly
scaled architecture. The central double-height gallery, based on
the Pantheon, includes a staircase fit for a scene in ``Gone With
the Wind.'' And Cropsey's paintings are skied, poorly lighted,
unlabeled and, worst of all, appear to have been vigorously
overcleaned to a harsh, uniform brightness.
</P>
<P>
   The art is much more at home, and is far easier to see, at the
Cropsey homestead, which he bought in 1885 and lived in for five
years, until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey, four years younger than Church, lacked the latter's
sense of spiritual drama and sweeping, eye-of-God perspectives.
Influenced by Constable, Cropsey was an earthier, more prosaic
painter, more likely than Church to include everyday signs of
domestic life and modern progress _ farms, grazing cows, villages,
trains and bridges _ in his elegantly worked paintings, which
reflect a special talent for portraying the glowing colors of
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   And while Church backed into architecture, discovering a new
outlet for his visionary impulses, Cropsey trained as an architect
and frequently worked as one even after his focus changed to
painting. His architectural credits include several Manhattan
brownstones, the 14th Street subway station for the old Sixth
Avenue el and the Moravian Church on Staten Island. (The most
informative display at the gallery is a small room devoted to his
architectural renderings.)
</P>
<P>
   Cropsey may also have built his own Olana, a 37-room
Elizabethan-Tudor mansion and studio in Warwick, N.Y., which he
named Aladdin. He was forced to sell it in 1884, after the Hudson
River School fell out of favor and his fortunes slumped; it burned
to the ground a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ever Rest, a relatively modest board-and-batten house built in
1830 to which Cropsey added a studio that he designed, is a
pleasure. It has a breathtaking view of the Hudson and is
chockablock with furniture and objects acquired by succeeding
Cropseys. Also on view are several pieces of furniture designed by
the artist; his palette, brushes and portable easel; the dress suit
he wore when presented to Queen Victoria, and a series of small
studies depicting the Battle of Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   The work lining the walls of Ever Rest forms a veritable Cropsey
retrospective, with the small oil studies and dozens of fine small
drawings as standouts. And the large studio is especially dramatic:
a grand, medieval banquet hall of a room lined with elaborate
paneling and crowned with a cupola whose windows open with pulleys.
An easel displays the artist's last work, an unfinished portrait of
his wife. A small watercolor reveals that the studio is almost an
exact replica of the one that Cropsey built at Aladdin.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's Locust Grove
</P>
<P>
   Locust Grove, the sprawling gentleman's estate farm that the
painter-turned-inventor Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791-1872)
purchased in 1847, is also a repository for art and furniture
acquired by several generations of inhabitants. It is much more of
a composite than Cropsey's Ever Rest, in part because Morse's life
and career were peripatetic _ he abandoned painting after it failed
to support him _ and in part because his children sold the house in
1901. Its new owner was William Young, whose daughter Annette lived
in the house until she died in 1975 and endowed a small trust to
maintain the estate as a historic site.
</P>
<P>
   The Youngs were sensitive to the Morse connection, retaining
some of his furniture and purchasing a few paintings by him (the
house also contains a model of the original telegraph). But they
were also inveterate collectors, especially of furniture, filling
the house with acquisitions that ranged from the 1700s to the late
19th century. The house is an amazingly crowded pastiche of
artifacts _ a Dutch marquetry bedroom set here, an Empire
gentleman's chest there, various pieces of Chippendale, numerous
grandfather clocks and even an Elizabethan Revival dining room set.
</P>
<P>
   In its profusion and disorder, Locust Grove is something of the
``Un-Olana,'' and what the public sees is only the tip of the
iceberg of decorative arts holdings. A new visitors' center, under
construction near the edge of the site, promises to be sympathetic
and unobtrusive. It may relieve some of the congestion, but the
current ambience of a large, high-end antiques store is not
altogether unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting aspect of the estate, aside from its
beautiful grounds, which Morse had a hand in planning, is the
house. It was Morse who enlarged and completely transformed it,
with the help of the architect Alexander Jackson Davis. The
original rectangular Federal structure was encased in an octagonal
Tuscan-style villa flanked by verandas, an arched porte-cochere on
one side and, on the other, a four-story tower with breathtaking
views of the Hudson. It is a graceful if subtly mongrel structure,
unfazed by the Youngs' addition of a dining and bedroom wing in
place of one of the verandas.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Edward Hopper House Art Center
</P>
<P>
   Hopper House, in Nyack, N.Y., is an example of the artist's
house as empty vessel _ one that, as these things go, was never
very full. Built in 1858 by his maternal grandfather, the clapboard
two-story house was Edward Hopper's birthplace and childhood home.
He left it in 1906 at age 24 and never lived there again, although
he retained title to the house and his sister lived there until her
death in 1965. But Hopper visited Nyack regularly and the area's
storefronts and houses appear in a few of his paintings. At his
death, in 1967, he was buried in Nyack's Oak Hill Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hopper House is a shoestring, grass-roots operation. Slated for
demolition in 1970, it was saved by local residents who formed the
Edward Hopper Landmark Preservation Foundation, solicited donations
and donated time and expertise to its restoration. Today it is a
cultural center, holding exhibitions, drawing classes and concerts;
its upstairs rooms are rented as offices. One small room is devoted
to Hopper's life and work, but it contains none of his art and,
except for an austere settee, no Hopper family furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to enter this green-shuttered white house, with its tall
French windows overlooking the Hudson, wide bare floorboards and
airy, high-ceilinged rooms, is to come under a spell that can be
described only as Hopperesque. The house is the modest prototype of
the austere white houses that Hopper turned into icons of
small-town America. Even the emptiness of the rooms seems to echo
the sparse interiors and emotional isolation of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprisingly affecting to see the point of origin of this
motif, and this mood. It resonates throughout Hopper's sensibility,
and gives the house its own kind of fullness.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Historic Landmark
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cole's yellow-and-white home, which overlooks the
Catksill Mountains, not the Hudson, as is often supposed, is an
instance of artist's-house purgatory. Although Cole inhabited it
for only the last 12 years of his life, his descendants occupied it
until the early 1960s, preserving much of his art and many of his
belongings. They even went so far as to block a proposed approach
to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge that would have required moving or
demolishing the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cole house received National Landmark status in
1965, it was refused as a gift by New York state. Emptied of its
contents in a heartbreaking auction, in which large paintings by
Cole sold for less than $1,000, the house was finally purchased by
a well-meaning group headed by the New York art dealer Ira
Spanierman. Calling itself the Thomas Cole Foundation, this hastily
assembled body ultimately lacked the money to keep the house open
or even to maintain it properly.
</P>
<P>
   But a happy ending may be in sight. In recent weeks, the Greene
County Historical Society, which bought some Cole items at the
auction, signed a contract to purchase the house from the
foundation. Management of the house will be overseen by a separate
board of directors, headed by Robert Stackman. A state grant has
been received for exterior repairs; a federal grant and affiliation
with the National Park Service may soon be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board does not expect to be able to reconstitute
more than a few rooms with displays of art and objects original to
the house during Cole's time, it says the house will be open in
time for Greene County's bicentennial celebration in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen Morris House
</P>
<P>
   With the house and studio of Suzy Frelinghuysen (1911-1988) and
George L.K. Morris (1905-1975), the 19th century gives way to the
20th, nature takes a backseat to culture and abstraction, and white
stucco and glass brick prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen and Morris, both from wealthy families who
encouraged their interests in art and music, married in 1934. A
devout abstractionist, founding member of the American Abstract
Artists and, later, an editor and art critic at Partisan Review,
Morris rekindled his wife's childhood interest in painting. By the
early '40s, they were known as the ``Park Avenue Cubists,'' along
with A.E. Gallatin and Charles Shaw, two other abstract painters of
independent means.
</P>
<P>
   Morris built the Bauhaus-inspired house on his family's Lenox,
Mass., estate in the early 1940s, working with the Stockbridge
architect John Butler Swann. He linked it to a studio that he had
built in 1930 that was based on the Paris studio of Le Corbusier,
with whom he had studied. The blazing white (recently repainted)
compound formed by these buildings has a nautical, Art Deco glamour
suitable to Nick and Nora Charles. There is a sunken bar underneath
the spiral stairs in the foyer and, instead of Asta, a pug named
Miss Rose once waited by the front door. But there is also a
well-chosen collection of works by Picasso, Gris, Miro, Leger,
Matisse, Braque and Helion, and Nonobjective fresco murals by the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Morris painted the ones in the house's courtyard, curving
stairway and living room. Frelinghuysen held forth in the dining
room, with bold Synthetic Cubist compositions in a signature
palette of blue, soft chartreuse and black. While her best efforts
are often more satisfying than Morris' more cerebral works, she
clearly took things less seriously, painting her bedroom with a
frothy landscape and quoting Mantegna on the ceiling, while he
created handsome wood and bakelite wall reliefs for his bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which was established in Frelinghuysen's will,
is overseen by her nephew, the artist T. Kinney Frelinhuysen, who
prepared the house for public display, while also managing to leave
it much as it was.
</P>
<P>
   As the visitor departs through the woods surrounding the house,
past a large reclining nude by Gaston Lachaise, an interesting
question takes shape: How many houses of 20th-century American
artists have already been lost to posterity, and how many will soon
be in danger?

IBM SWIMS AGAINST THE TIDE WITH HIGH-END APTIVA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Now that we're all comfortable with the idea of buying really
cheap home computers, IBM Corp. is stepping out with a bold new
strategy _ selling really expensive home computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Aptiva SE7, nicknamed Cobra, is the hottest box IBM has ever
built for home users. It features a 450-megahertz Intel Pentium II
processor, a DVD-ROM drive that can show razor-sharp digital
movies, and a hulking 16.8 gigabyte hard drive, all in a sleek
black case that IBM executives compare to the look of an Air Force
Stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Either you want the fastest thing or you want the best
style,'' said Ellen Reid Smith, vice president of worldwide
marketing for IBM's consumer products division. ``The stealth
series we're bringing out has both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra will come to market after Labor Day and carry a list
price of $2,399, enough to pay for a couple of lesser machines.
Computer buffs with money to burn can also invest in a matching
15-inch flat-panel monitor for $999, available in October.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can buy an entire computer for $999 these days.
But Smith says there's a hunger for high-end hardware. She says
that despite all the hoopla over cheap computers, only about 20
percent of PCs purchased this year will cost less than $1,000, not
including monitor. Meanwhile, machines priced above $2,000 will get
nearly as big a slice &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; about 18 percent of the market. Right
now, said Smith, most of that high-end business is going to the big
direct marketers like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway 2000 Inc. Now
IBM is determined to get its share.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad move, according to Aaron Goldberg, executive vice
president of industry research firm Ziff-Davis Market Intelligence.
``What IBM is saying is, there's a person out there who wants to
buy the Cadillac,'' said Goldberg. Indeed, a better example might
be the Dodge Viper, the radical high-end sports car produced in
small numbers by Chrysler Corp. Just adding the Viper to its
product line helped Chrysler sell its lesser models as well.
Goldberg said the Cobra could do the same for IBM's line of PCs.
``There's a certain halo effect that having something really cool
gives them.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the cruel relish of a bleak Irish wit, Colin
Quinn recalls for us the peculiar narrow-minded characters of his
Brooklyn youth: J.T., the scornful druggie; Aidan, the venomous
alcoholic; Margaret, the perpetual martyr; Jimmy, the judgmental
do-nothing. Yet for all the dark and finely drawn characters he
introduces in the course of his one-man show, the most surprising
character on the stage of the Helen Hayes Theater is Quinn himself.
</P>
<P>
   Given his prominent television comedy job, as the new anchor of
``Weekend Update'' on ``Saturday Night Live,'' you might have
assumed that ``Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake,'' which opened Thursday
night, would be a satirical spinoff of his late-night showcase. But
if you were expecting a standup comic, a Seinfeldesque brush with
Broadway, fuhgeddaboutit. What you get in Quinn instead is an
honest-to-goodness seanachai.
</P>
<P>
   A who? A seanachai, which is pronounced SHAWN-uh-kee: an Irish
storyteller, a weaver of legends. At the foot of a set of steps,
designed by Eugene Lee to resemble the stoops of Park Slope, Quinn
spends a little more than an hour recreating the twisted universe
of his late adolescence and invoking the small-town voices that
echo on the insular blocks of the big city. He seems relieved to
have blasted out of that universe, because the voices are harsh;
there is not a scintilla of sentimentality in Quinn's admirably
brutal, mostly unlovable portraits. But they certainly sound
authentic, to the point where sections of ``An Irish Wake'' feel
like documentary outtakes.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``An Irish Wake,'' which Quinn wrote with Lou
DiMaggio, and which is directed by Bobby Moresco, is in its
specificity and literacy. The vehemence of Aidan's attack on a boy
who fails to bring him a proper Scotch and soda (``The little
pimple-faced Judas has sold me out for 30 pieces of silver,'' Quinn
declares in an Irish accent), the self-abnegating response of
Margaret when a mourner stomps on her foot _ ``No, it's OK, honey,
I'll offer it up'' _ indicate a highly developed ear for the
ironically funny detail, a pleasing awareness of the magnetic
appeal of precision in language. He's a tale-spinner who chooses
his words with the utmost care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the persistent sense of an assignment unfinished
about ``Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake,'' and it has more to do with
Quinn the performer than the writer. Unlike other soloists who
speak in multiple voices, like John Leguizamo and Anna Deavere
Smith, Quinn is no chameleon. As is apparent in the roles he gets
on ``Saturday Night Live,'' he usually plays Colin Quinn. That's
not a knock. He's extremely funny; his smart-alecky ``Weekend
Update'' spots have reinvigorated that hoary feature. Although he
makes no claim on the stage of the Helen Hayes to be an
impressionist _ roundish and impish, he charts a neutral
performance course in conjuring his neighborhood cronies, relying
on subtler cues in the text to make the people come alive _ a bit
of the mimic's craft here would not be amiss.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, his characters are all specific in the same
ways; it's difficult, at times, to figure out where one person
begins and another ends. And the 39-year-old Quinn, who is a genial
but not especially warm presence, makes the dangerous assumption
that you arrive at the theater well-versed in the kinds of people
and situations he knows so well; his shorthand discussions of the
seven sacraments, around which he structures the stories, will
mystify many a non-Roman Catholic. He provides so little context in
this piece, in fact, it's as if you had been invited to a friend's
office party, where everyone is telling jokes about people you've
never heard of. You want to laugh with them, but mostly what you
feel is left out.
</P>
<P>
   The monologue is set on a day in 1976 when a beloved veteran of
the neighborhood, Jackie Ryan, has died, and the community gathers
for his wake. One by one, Quinn sizes up the working-class Irish
characters who made up his world. The respect he pays them is that
the portraits are unvarnished. These are people who fall easily
into black moods, who complain and curse with equal fluency, who
view love as a bitter pill and a life's progress as falling
naturally into the regulatory path of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you had a group of people who had spent their whole lives
doing what they were told, kept their mouths shut, beaten by the
nuns and told that sex was bad,'' one of the characters explains.
``Then 20 years later, when our marriages were filled with silence,
violence and bad sex, we blamed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's people are ferociously devoted to their narrow ways;
they are fatalistic and terribly hard on one another. And they're
brawlers who lash out madly at ideas that frighten them. At
Jackie's wake, his pal Jimmy notes, ``There was the sober Jackie,
who played stickball with the neighborhood kids, and there was the
Jackie three beers later who chased an Econoline van with a
broken-off car antenna, because he thought he saw a peace sign on
the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The storyteller is not a benign presence. The stories he selects
do not portray these people in the most favorable light. They are a
carelessly nasty crew. Aidan hisses ``Whore!'' at the boy who
serves him the wrong drink; J.T. has sex on the grave of his
grandmother. What binds these souls is a duty to religion, a
sneering mistrust of the rest of the world and a sense that the way
things are is just the way things are. These are small stories
about small people, and they get a bit swallowed up on a Broadway
stage. Perhaps in more intimate surroundings, the clear-eyed
Quinn's tormented characters would cast bigger shadows.

   &UR; Careful Steps On Career Path &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger has a few things in common with Ellen Gulden,
the character Ms. Zellweger plays in the coming ``One True Thing,''
which also stars Meryl Streep and William Hurt and is to be
released by Universal on Sept. 18. Ellen is a budding magazine
writer, and Ms. Zellweger initially wanted to major in journalism
when she entered the University of Texas. The two are brainy. They
are also uncompromising, but in a way that sets them apart and also
explains why Ms. Zellweger, a surprise hit in ``Jerry Maguire'' two
years ago, has been choosy in the parts she has played since then
and is only now emerging with a major role in a big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her ambition defines her,'' Ms. Zellweger said of Ellen, a
young woman who reaches a personal crisis in part because her
family life conflicts with her professional aims. ``I'm not like
that,'' she observed. ``I think I'm a determined person, but not
for the same reasons as her, not at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has come relatively quickly for Ms. Zellweger, but, so
far at least, it has been largely on her terms, an unusual thing
for a 29-year-old actress. The tendency when an attractive young
woman hits it big is to accept the many roles that require good
looks even if they don't offer much substance. Ms. Zellweger has
rejected that approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when you start out, especially when you're just
starting out, and if you're blond, to play the bimbo, the party
girl, the ex-girlfriend is kind of a natural,'' said the blond Ms.
Zellweger, who hails from Katy, Texas ``It's a really frustrating
process.''
</P>
<P>
   She added in her breathy whisper of a voice, ``I decided I
wasn't going to be in those kinds of films _ you know, the triple-D
girl by the keg.'' In this spirit, she was cast against type as an
independent-minded young Hasidic wife in the critically praised ``A
Price Above Rubies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Zellweger has not gone unscathed. She played Tammy, a
girl who has a one-night stand with Ethan Hawke in ``Reality
Bites.'' ``There's always something to learn,'' Ms. Zellweger said
of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' is a quiet, emotionally intense drama about a
young woman called back to her parents' home after her mother falls
ill. She reluctantly puts her writing career aside and wrestles
with the self-absorption of her father, a renowned college
professor, and the seeming superficiality of her mother, a
housewife caught up in the rhythms of small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the story, based on the the novel by Anna Quindlen, a
former columnist for The New York Times, is about people learning,
reluctantly, to listen to their hearts rather than their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a bit like the way Ms. Zellweger describes her own
deliberate career path. ``It was never so much about taking what
you can get as what you want ultimately from what you do,'' she
said. ``I always thought it was so much harder to double back and
get on the right road after you do that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tolkien Times 3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In its biggest, and perhaps most unusual, financial commitment
ever, New Line Cinema has decided to spend more than $130 million
producing a film version of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy tale,
``The Lord of the Rings.'' But for Robert Shaye, New Line's
chairman, the issue is not spending huge sums but saving $50
million, sort of like the person who says that buying a Rolls-Royce
for the cut-rate price of $100,000 is really saving $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Tolkien project is exceptional because it involves the
consecutive production of three different movies, generally
following the story line of Tolkien's trilogy about the journey of
Frodo Baggins as he fights the Dark Lord, Sauron, and saves the
hobbits. The movies are expected to run in close proximity, perhaps
six months apart, starting on Christmas 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are great risks as well as potential rewards. If the first
movie fails, this will bode ill for the remaining two. But it will
actually be a relatively low-cost production, in spite of the huge
overall price tag. The director, co-writer and co-producer will be
Peter Jackson, a New Zealander best known for his role as a writer,
producer and director of ``Heavenly Creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will be filming the three movies in New Zealand, where
productions are significantly cheaper than in the United States. In
addition, he has started a special-effects company in New Zealand,
which is expected to produce the large number of computer-generated
shots to be used in the fantasy films.
</P>
<P>
   Shaye said that by making the three films together, without the
need to create a new infrastructure each time, the overall costs
would be reduced by as much as $50 million. Jackson said the films
would be shot over the period of a year, with short breaks in
between. The movie would be largely live action with some computer
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, Jackson was originally working with Miramax on
the project. But when he insisted on making it into more than one
movie, which is what Miramax wanted, it allowed him to take the
idea elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many projects I'd spend three and a half years
on,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview from Wellington, New
Zealand. ``But `The Lord of the Rings' is so special, so
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's always been regarded as impossible to film, but
with what we can do with the computers now, it's just the right
time.'' He said that, in another effort to keep costs down, the
movies would use relatively unknown actors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Battle Joined &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The technology pioneer Steve Jobs is not exactly unfamiliar with
ferocious competition, but he was unusually upbeat in a recent
interview in describing how he sees his position in a market that
has grown dangerously cluttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so far ahead of anyone else it's not funny!'' Jobs
exclaimed. Referring to his new film, ``A Bug's Life,'' he added,
``It has 10 times the computer power of anything we did in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is well known as a founder and currently interim chief
executive of Apple Computer, but he was talking in this instance
about another passion, movies. ``A Bug's Life,'' an animated movie
his company, Pixar, will be releasing through the Walt Disney
Company in November, is a contender in what promises to be the most
heated battle ever in the market for children's films.
</P>
<P>
   Five major movies with animation will be released between
October and Christmas in a contest that some people believe could
alter the competitive landscape, depending on who can actually turn
a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life,'' which follows Pixar's last film, ``Toy
Story,'' and will be released on Nov. 20, offers, as Jobs puts it,
``the most striking animation ever made.'' ``The Rugrats Movie,''
to be released by Paramount on Nov. 20, builds on the hugely
popular cartoon franchise from Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt,'' due on Dec. 18 from Dreamworks, is
regarded as an expensive effort by the new studio to steal a
significant portion of the animated-movie business from the leader,
Disney. And then there are ``Antz'' , a co-production of Dreamworks
and due on Oct. 2, and ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' due on Nov. 25
from Universal, a sequel to ``Babe,'' a film that involves live
action and a modest amount of computer effects to give the illusion
that the animals are talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought the summer was a much more likely time
for some of these,'' said Joe Roth, the chairman of Disney's movie
division. ``You worry about this competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the studios has approached the problem by trying to
argue that its film is unique and not really in competition with
the others. Terry Press, the head of marketing for Dreamworks, for
instance, said that both ``Antz'' and ``The Prince of Egypt'' were
not solely children's movies, but rather were aimed at a slightly
older audience, for those 8 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman, the vice chairman of Paramount, said that ``The
Rugrats Movie'' would enjoy the benefit of an instantly
recognizable franchise and that it would be about family values.
</P>
<P>
   And some are more straightforward. ``We think we have a very
good film,'' Jobs said.

SCIENCE PROGRAMS STRIVE TO BE LABORATORIES OF DIVERSITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WALTHAM, Mass. _ This summer, Julius Wilder spent most of his
waking hours, often seven days a week, conducting painstaking DNA
immunology research that would cause most college students to flee
for the beach. The 20-year-old junior wasn't intimidated or bored
by his experience, however; he was juiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made me excited to enter this world,'' Wilder said
recently between experiments at a Brandeis University lab. ``But I
have to admit it's kind of daunting, at times, to look and see that
there's almost nobody in this world who looks like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades after other disciplines diversified their ranks, or at
least began drawing upward trend lines for women and minorities,
the sciences remain starkly white and male.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, along with Hispanics and Native Americans, accounted for
just 6.5 percent of the job market in science and engineering in
1995, according to statistics compiled by the National Science
Foundation. The comparable figure for women, whose participation in
most careers approaches or equals that of men, was 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these continuing disparities _ perhaps the
largest gender and racial gaps in any profession today _ American
colleges and universities are aggressively pursuing an array of
initiatives directed at ``underrepresented minorities'' and women.
They are doing so despite the assault on affirmative-action and
set-aside programs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the public generally understands the problem,
and it goes beyond just wanting to make the sciences representative
for reasons of principle,'' said Freeman Hrabowski III, president
of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. That institution's
Meyerhoff Scholarship program is considered one of the most
ambitious, successful efforts in the country to move blacks into
the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a national priority to eliminate the gap in the health
status between minorities and the white population,'' Hrabowski
added. ``To reach that goal, the country needs ... scientists who
understand the social and environmental backgrounds of the
populations involved. The sciences need everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity efforts aimed at women and other minorities, some
involving small amounts of money and others entailing millions of
dollars, all have the same goals: to lure their targets into
science education, to maintain their interest in subjects that can
be dry and rigorous, and to lead them into related careers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University, for instance, has a half-million-dollar piece
of a $65 million US government endeavor to develop prototypes for
21st century high-tech computing. About $500,000 of the national
total is aimed specifically at promoting participation by women,
blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Roscoe Giles, deputy
director of BU's Center for Computational Sciences, said there is
an ``overall emphasis'' throughout the project to include members
of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Asians are not considered ``underrepresented minorities''
because their percentages among students and workers in
science-related fields consistently exceed their proportion (3
percent) of the general American population.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis administers a fellowship project in which 25 of its own
students are joined each summer by six high-achieving minorities _
three black undergraduates from the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County and three Hispanics from the University
of Puerto Rico. The idea, funded with a total of $775,000 in
renewable grants since 1993, is to show off the best of the
sciences by paying the expenses of students who otherwise might not
get exposed to a prestigious institution, and letting them work
with some of the country's top academics and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of hands-on, one-student-at-a-time approach is typical
of programs throughout the United States. And, although statistics
show only small progress, participants insist their projects are
steadily chipping away at a historic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent but the success rate, ... based on
hearing from past students who now work in the sciences, is really
good,'' said Joan Press, a biology professor who runs the Brandeis
program. ``We're making headway, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, National Research Council reports show that, from 1977
to 1995, the proportion of all master's degrees in the natural
sciences and engineering earned by blacks rose from 3.9 percent to
5.3 percent; from 3.1 to 5.8 percent for Hispanics; and from 0.4 to
0.5 percent for Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While only nibbling at the edges of the problem in the short
run, the long-range intent of these targeted programs is to change
the image of and atmosphere within the sciences. Most try to do
that at institutions of higher education, thereby creating more
role models, but many initiatives also are designed to reshape the
perceptions of younger females and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Eighty urban teenagers in eighth to 10th grade nationwide,
including three from the Boston area, attended a weeklong camp at
the University of Minnesota earlier this month sponsored by the
Association of Science and Technology Centers and the National
Association of Biology Teachers. The students studied bugs and
plants, but they were also part of a bigger effort to get
youngsters interested in science careers.
</P>
<P>
   _The National Science Foundation, which directs tens of millions
of dollars into initiatives nationwide to attract women and
minorities, began the Black Churches Initiative six years ago. In
that project, adults who run day-care centers and other children's
programs in 5,000 US churches are trained to teach young people
about various sciences.
</P>
<P>
   _The public school system in Hartford, which is 94 percent
minority and is the second-largest in New England, is in the middle
of a five-year, multimillion-dollar project _ funded by the
National Science Foundation _ aimed at tripling the number of its
black and Hispanic students who enter science, math, and
engineering tracks when they go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way we can change the current situation, which badly
needs changing ... is to expose people to the sciences earlier, and
in a positive, appealing way,'' said Steven Zottoli, a biology
professor at Williams College who administers a $900,000 grant
directed toward women and minorities at his school, as well as two
other projects with the same targets.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the public National Science Foundation, which was
established by Congress, the most vigorous advocate for women and
minorities is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. ``We very much
have taken on as one of our goals to get a full cross-section of
American society into the sciences,'' said David Jarmul, a
spokesman for the Maryland-based institute, which is primarily a
research facility with a $500 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes Institute spends about $90 million a year on
educational efforts outside its walls, much of it intended directly
or indirectly to diversify the sciences. The Brandeis and Williams
College programs are both funded by Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others are a $300,000 project called CityLab, run out
of Boston University's School of Medicine and designed to expose
high school students to scientific research; a $2.25 million
program at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, which seeks
to better train that city's teachers in science-teaching skills;
and $2.6 million in subsidies to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for summer programs for minorities.

<P>
   ``People may disagree about the remedy, but there's no question
that it's an insane situation,'' said Giles of Boston University,
referring to the racial and gender gulf in the sciences. ``It's so
big that you have to do something.''

 &HT;    Pain, peril break serenity of daily life
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ason is killed, a wife dies, a lover ends a long relationship.
As Yeats wrote, ``Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.'' That
line from ``The Second Coming'' leapt to mind in reading three
well-wrought novels in which day-to-day reality is irreparably
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reservation Road. By John Burnham Schwartz. Knopf. $24. 292
pages.
</P>
<P>
   When the Learner family, returning from an outdoor concert,
stops by a gas station, 10-year-old Josh is killed by a hit-and-run
driver. His parents, Ethan and Grace, and 8-year-old sister Emma
struggle with guilt, anger and emotional paralysis. The killer,
Dwight Arno, hides his crime. He is a lawyer whose own life was
shattered when he beat his son, Sam, and his wife on the night she
ended their marriage. The novel moves forward in alternating
first-person voices of Ethan, Dwight and Grace. Their lives
intertwine in ways they do not recognize, but that readers do.
Eventually, Ethan pieces together the puzzle and confronts Dwight,
whose concern for Sam in the face of his own peril creates an
unusually moving scene. No character is solely good or evil, solely
perpetrator or victim in this gut-wrenching great American tragedy
from the author of ``Bicycle Days.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Death in Summer. By William Trevor. Viking. $23.95. 214
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Thaddeus Davenant, impoverished owner of a British country home,
marries the wealthy Letitia and they are blessed with a baby,
Georgina. When Letitia is killed in a bicycle accident, the fusty
Thaddeus feels guilty because he didn't love Letitia, married her
for her money, and because they argued before she died. Meanwhile,
Georgina needs a nanny, and the applicants, including one named
Pettie, are unqualified. Thaddeus reluctantly accepts the services
of Letitia's mother, Mrs. Iveson, who moves into the house, much to
the chagrin of the obsessed, spying Pettie. That summer there will
be two more deaths and an abduction, but to tell more would ruin
the tale. Yet, this is not so much a mystery as a marvelous dance
of class consciousness and language. Each character is presented
through a particular syntactical tenor, growing, much like flowers,
page by page in Trevor's subtle linguistic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Essence of the Thing. By Madeleine St. John. Carroll &AMP;
Graf. $22. 234 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Nicola, who has lived happily with Jonathan in a London flat for
years, is shocked when he abruptly announces he has ceased to love
her. Nicola is devastated, but still she irons the creep's shirts,
hoping he'll change his nerdy little mind. Gradually, she comes to
her senses and moves out and on with her life. American women, who
were reading this sort of thing back in the '70s, may at first
wonder why this book was nominated this year for a Booker Prize.
But as dialogue succeeds dialogue, as more couples come onstage,
the plot turns into an exploration of how to keep one's
individuality in a relationship. In one hilarious scene, two
friends cut inches off Nicola's hem, put her in fishnet hose, top
her off with the perfect hat and take her dancing all night.
Exhilarated, she returns to find guess who begging forgiveness.
Anyone who watches ``Ally McBeal'' can intuit her decision.
Sometimes, when things fall apart, they get better.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Closer inspection finds `Ryan,' `Titanic' kindred
spirits in film
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, about all that last year's smash hit,
``Titanic,'' which arrives in video stores this week, would appear
to have in common with this year's unanticipated hit, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' is that they both feature boats. Lots of little
boats for ``Saving Private Ryan's'' celebrated D-Day sequence and
one very big boat for ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   They also both have certified heartthrobs at their center:
``Titanic's'' blue-eyed blond, Leonardo DiCaprio, and ``Saving
Private Ryan's'' blue-eyed blond, Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they seem completely different. One is a hugely
expensive, rumor-plagued, unabashedly commercial behemoth. The
other is a carefully controlled, rumor-free, prestige picture.
One's Oscar-winning potential seemed almost an afterthought _ a
surprising yet somehow inevitable bonus of its immense box office
success. The other's Oscar chances seem part of its existence from
the very beginning while, conversely, its unexpected box office
clout (four weeks in the top spot) wasn't part of anyone's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Look more closely, however, and similarities surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both have similar forms,'' points out Michael Wilmington, the
lead film critic for the Chicago Tribune. ``It's a classical
Hollywood form. The John Ford paradigm. The story of `Stagecoach'
(the 1939 Ford film that launched John Wayne's career). A group of
people undergoing a crisis. And that crisis is revealing. Character
is stripped bare.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``And I'm not referring to the sketching scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Another parallel, Wilmington continues, is the way both movies
``are framed by something in the present that gives meaning to the
past. In a sense, they have exactly the same endings.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, consider the wraparound style of storytelling
that applies to both films. In each case, the main action, be it
the love story aboard the Titanic or the mission to find Private
Ryan, is book-ended by a present-day prologue and epilogue. In
James Cameron's script, elderly Gloria Stewart remembers her
tragic, life-altering teenage romance while staring at the rusted
hull of the once-mighty Titanic. In the Steven Spielberg film,
seventysomething Harrison Young seeks validation for his life while
staring at the grave of a fallen soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the most literal level, both are framed with flashbacks by
survivors,'' says Matthew Bernstein, associate professor of film
studies at Emory University. ``The two frameworks create that sense
of inevitability and fate. Of things out of control. Of who
survives and who doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People really connect with the various vignettes of
catastrophe in both movies,'' he adds, echoing Wilmington's Ford
paradigm. ``The idea of making difficult choices when the chips are
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A further likeness, notes Bernstein, is the simple fact of both
films' technical virtuosity. ``An aesthetic of astonishment'' is
his phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Titanic,' you've got this incredible spectacle. This ship
breaking apart and sinking in a way that's never been visualized
before. There's something similar in `Saving Private Ryan.' A
catastrophic battle scene that's never been photographed in that
way before. That immense scope coupled with that hand-held,
you-are-there camera work that immediately pulls you in.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bernstein says he thinks it's important to
give credit to the characters. ``People really connected with that
conventional romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
They find them very winning and endearing characters. And in
`Saving Private Ryan,' you have to give a lot of credit to Tom
Hanks and his reincarnation of Jimmy Stewart. Again, people really
connect with that all-American good guy. So both combine the epic
with the intimate in very compelling ways.''
</P>
<P>
   One final similarity: For all their size, both ``Titanic'' and
``Saving Private Ryan'' are personal projects, propelled by their
directors' unique vision. Neither is a sequel. Neither is a
pitch-perfect example of demographic-think. Both are films their
directors had to make. Maybe that's what audiences really connected
with _ a story worth telling told by an artist who had to be the
one to tell it.
</P>
<P>
   As Spielberg said to one interviewer, ``As I had children and as
I grew up, I wanted to leave something behind that I could really
be proud of that wasn't just dinosaurs stepping on stuff. ... I
felt I had a kind of duty to those veterans of World War II to
finally acquit them of their experience in a non-Hollywood way.''

 &HT;    Atlanta's producer at large
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York_When Alex Hitz was 8 years old and an overnight guest
at the White House, then-President Carter gave him his bathrobe,
saying that the boy ``must be cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hitz said recently, he was a little spooked, too. He'd
glanced in the Lincoln Bedroom, where his stepfather (then-Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra maestro Robert Shaw) and mother, Caroline, were
to sleep, and ``That room looked like it was full of ghosties.''
Young Alex opted to bunk in the Nixon Study, solo, and passed the
night without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Hitz at 30 is still a bit of a maverick and has the perfect job
description for someone of an independent bent: free-lance producer
at large.
</P>
<P>
   After various endeavors in his early 20s (art dealer, co-owner
of an Atlantra restaurant), the Washington and Lee University(Va.)
graduate went to see his famous stepfather receive a Kennedy Center
Honor in 1991 and there met lyricist and co-honoree Betty Comden.
They hit it off so well that Hitz became an associate producer of
the 1997 Central Park mounting of her ``On the Town,'' launching
that vintage musical toward its upcoming Broadway production. He
simultaneously helped produce last fall's ``The Triumph of Love,''
an 18th-century comedy set to new music that had some glowing
reviews but didn't live long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't be surprised,'' Hitz says with a rueful smile,
``but I find myself in a dog-eat-dog business that can be
terrifying. I learned a lot from Margo Lion (producer of ``Angels
in America''), but at some point you have to take your knocks and
figure out the political pyramids on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitz also was associate producer of the current Broadway revival
of ``The Sound of Music,'' expected to announce a tour soon. He's
done this while commuting almost weekly between his Ansley Park
condo and the Carlyle Hotel, his Gotham base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love both places, and it's also nice to get away from both
places,'' says the suave, single Southerner as he digs into a
Carlyle breakfast, a polka-dotted handkerchief artfully spilling
from his blazer pocket. In the words of Virginia Adair, a longtime
family friend: ``I don't think anyone gives a better dinner party
than Alex. He's got such an eye for detail, and he's got his
lyrical side; you just know he'll go far.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawson Foreman, an Atlanta lawyer and Hitz's cousin, recalls,
``I can remember Alex as a kid peddling around Ansley Park, talking
up a storm, finding out everything, building a social network. Now,
when I hear him talk about having dinner with Prince Charles, and
producing Broadway shows, it's like he was taken up in a spaceship
and this incredibly sophisticated fellow was sent back down!''
</P>
<P>
   Hitz's main role in the aforementioned shows has been raising
money _ some of it from friends in Atlanta, a good chunk of it lost
when ``Triumph'' tanked _ but now he's embarking on a more creative
path. He's one of the conceptualizers of ``68,'' a musical about a
girl's coming-of-age in that stormy year. His co-producers have
impressive credits: Richard Frankel (``Driving Miss Daisy''), Heidi
Ettinger (who designed the ravishing sets for ``The Secret
Garden'') and Jonathan Reynolds (author of ``Geniuses,'' who's
writing the musical book). Hitz says they're talking to Stephen
Trask, hottest theatrical rock songwriter of the moment (``Hedwig
and the Angry Inch''), about composing the score. The show will be
workshopped in New York in January with an eye toward a
pre-Broadway tryout in Washington in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hitz is also developing films _ one about the British
photographer and costume designer Cecil Beaton, and another with
``an Atlanta story, possibly with a very well-known screenwriter I
can't mention yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``The Sound of Music'' is, in Hitz's words,
``perking right along at the box office,'' and the production
reminds him of why all the aggravation is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moment during the cast party at Tavern on the
Green,'' Hitz says, ``when I saw the lights twinkling in the trees,
the people dancing and drinking champagne, and I thought, `Hmm _
there are worse businesses to be in.'''

 &HT;    `Civil War', `Aida' make regional rounds
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In terms of new musicals this fall, there is as much action out
of town as in. Major players of the theater world can be seen at
such perennial Broadway steppingstones as Boston, as well as newer
tryout cities such as Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major musicals trying out in the regional theaters
and on the road:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida.'' Atlanta has given
birth to several important plays and players in recent years, but
in terms of sheer show-biz visibility it's never seen the likes of
this: a world premiere collaboration between the Alliance Theatre
and Walt Disney Theatrical Productions. Songs are by Elton John and
Tim Rice, coming off their triumphant score for Disney's ``The Lion
King.'' Author Linda Woolverton (``Beauty and the Beast'') is
giving a somewhat contemporary spin to the biracial love-triangle
immortalized in Verdi's 1871 opera. Judging by a hearing of
rehearsals in New York, the music will rock; judging by a glimpse
of sets and costumes being loaded into the Alliance, the show will
dazzle. (Previews Sept. 17, opens Oct. 7).
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance.'' It's been 10
years since choreographer Bob Fosse collapsed and died on a
Washington street _ on his way to one of his shows, in tryouts _
and his legend only looms larger today. Livent (``Ragtime'') is
producing this compilation of his stylish, sensual dances. Variety
praised the show in its recent Toronto premiere. It's conceived by
Gwen Verdon, Fosse's one-time wife and frequent leading lady, and
co-choreographed by Ann Reinking, who so brilliantly adapted the
spirit of his dances for ``Chicago.'' (Previews Sept. 8, opening
TBA, through Sept. 27, Colonial Theatre, Boston. Previews Oct. 9,
opening TBA, through Dec. 6, Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles.
Expected to move to Broadway in December or January).
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Civil War.'' The War Between the States as ... a
musical? Springtime for Stonewall? A Ken Burns documentary with
production numbers? Not exactly. Burns has no role in this new
musical, but it uses some of the historical writings (by Lincoln,
Whitman, Frederick Douglass) that informed his magnificent PBS
series. Certainly these writers outshine the middlebrows who
usually collaborate with composer Frank Wildhorn, who has two shows
on Broadway (``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''). Though
he has a long way to go before reaching Andrew Lloyd Webber's
success, Wildhorn shares the Brit's knack for surviving bad reviews
with slick pop tunes that people love. They can hear them on two
advance CDs, one sung by Nashville stars for October release, and
the other a cast album to hit stores in January. (Previews Sept. 8,
opens Sept. 16, Alley Theatre, Houston).
</P>
<P>
   -- ``By Jeeves.'' Speaking of Lloyd Webber, his output has
slowed in recent years, and his most recent musical, ``Whistle Down
the Wind,'' is getting retooled in Great Britain. In the meantime,
he's put back into play the only other flop of his career, also
reworked, a 1970s collaboration with the endlessly imaginative
comic playwright Alan Ayckbourn. It's based on the beloved comic
stories of P.G. Wodehouse. (Previews Oct. 17, opening TBA,
Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Conn.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Gypsy.'' When the trumpet-voiced Betty Buckley (who sang
``Memory'' in ``Cats'') is found in a medium-size theater in
Millburn, N.J., you know there's a lack of top-shelf work for her
in Gotham. Then again, a trouper such as Buckley will go almost
anywhere for one of the best-written musicals (Arthur Laurents,
Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim) and one of the greatest roles, Mama
Rose, memorably played by Ethel Merman and Tyne Daly in years past.
Could the 1959 classic again be a candidate for Broadway? (Previews
Sept. 9, opening TBA, Paper Mill Playhouse).

 &HT;    Relative obscurity suits Chappell, a writer's writer
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Chappell is a poet and novelist of modest aspirations. ``I
don't really have any confidence that I will be remembered, or any
desire to be remembered,'' he says a few hours before delivering
the fall convocation address at Georgia College &AMP; State University
recently. ``If I am going to be remembered, I guess I'd like to be
remembered as someone who did less harm than he was capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in khakis, a blue Oxford button-down and only slightly
crooked bow tie, Chappell projects a genial, farm boy persona that
can't quite conceal his ability and his intellect. He is poet
laureate of North Carolina, a professor at the University of North
Carolina-Greensboro and the author of some 20 books of fiction,
poetry and short stories. Partly because he is not flashy and
partly because he hails from a writer-rich state that has nurtured
Reynolds Price, Anne Tyler, William Styron, Kaye Gibbons and
countless others in the contemporary pantheon, his name isn't as
widely known as his admirers would like. But at age 62, Chappell
basks in the freedom of ``relative obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred is a real marvel, an authentic genius to work so well in
every known mode and genre _ and to be so prolific and so
public-spirited,'' says fellow North Carolina writer Lee Smith
(``News of the Spirit''), who has known Chappell since the early
1960s. ``But Fred is a writer who would rather write than market
himself. He spends so much of his time talking to little groups of
poetry ladies ... and he's spoken at every podunk school in North
Carolina over the years. He's always taken such care to respond
personally to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: He's not schmoozing at Cape Cod every
summer. ... But he has this incredible national reputation among
writers, and he's at the peak of his powers right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell writes with the poet's love of language: ``The wind had
got into the clocks and blown the hours awry.'' His stories are
almost equal parts realism and fantasy, tall tales and mountain
yarns, hymns and dream sequences. Old people are ``age-bent,'' and
children are ``pigtail age.'' Knucklebones are as white as if the
``skin had been peeled off them.'' Sentences shoot out of a mouth
``like a rock from a slingshot.'' Things happen in places called
Worrisome Creek and Forgetful Mountain. And every year, teetotaling
grandmas quite knowingly allow some of their carefully canned grape
juice to ferment. Above all, Chappell's work is built on an abiding
sense of community _ not of a particular family or town, but of
humankind _ and an unfailing reliance on humor as a tool of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my aims in writing has always been to capture that
first excitement I got on reading writers who knocked me flat on my
butt when I was young: John Steinbeck, Ray Bradbury and, a little
later, Thomas Mann. And poets _ Keats, wooooo! Gee, that was good
stuff! It still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Chappell's fiction feels autobiographical, although he's
quick to say he's not sure exactly how much really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiction is memory and imagination _ neither one of them is
factually accurate. They are both accurate in a more profound,
important way. They're emotionally accurate. ... So I don't know if
anybody ever actually said a certain amount of dialogue. I have no
idea if I heard it somewhere or if I made it up on the spot. My
feeling is I probably don't make up too much of this stuff. But it
gets all jumbled from various sources, and it comes out the best
way it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think I have in my head is a lot of phony memories. My
earliest memory is of someone leaning over a crib or a bassinet.
There was this huge, enormous, ugly face _ probably my daddy or
mother _ and I was frightened by it. But whether that's a real
memory or not I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell is at once a product of and an escapee from the
Appalachian Mountains. Born and reared near the ``grimy'' little
mill town of Canton (population 5,000) in western North Carolina,
he discovered writing as many youngsters do, by way of reading. For
whatever mystical reason, the young Appalachian found something
irresistible in the nearly impenetrable prose of Thomas Mann. He
was entranced, and life on the farm was no longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   A raw talent for writing helped get Chappell into Duke
University(NC), where he spent the first two years ``drinking beer
and reading books out of the library and not going to class.'' ``I
was not a poster boy,'' he admits freely. ``I still am not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the displaced farm boy became immersed in the
classics, studying the various styles and forms that would help
shape his own distinctive voice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Chappell's fiction and poetry is firmly grounded in the
rural South, but throughout there are allusions on a much grander
scale to influences ranging from Dante, Baudelaire and Rimbaud to
Pound, Haydn and even Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   In his four-cycle poem ``Midquest'' (1981), the grandmother
warns the narrator, Ole Fred, not to get ``away from what you
are.'' Chappell seems to have found comfortable ground: Although he
``deserted'' his homeplace for a life of writing and academia,
clearly he plows much of that rural territory over and over again
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to train yourself to be an observer,'' Chappell says.
``And a lot of things you pick up without really observing. You
just kind of take it in through your pores. And after you learn to
observe, there's a difference in the quality of observation. This
was a problem in a lot of my material. I had learned to observe
after those experiences happened to me. So I had to bring tools
from later in life to bear on experiences in my earlier life
without falsifying those feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell has always found inspiration in the everyday: ``girls,
cats, wine, weather _ all the good stuff.'' And with a little
inspiration, the details of an ordinary life become universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was the life of Little Mary,'' Chappell wrote in
``Farewell, I'm Bound to Leave You'' (1996). ``She had got through
it, we each of us thought, the way you eat a plate of food when
you're not hungry a bit. She was only forty-three when she died. I
forget what medical reason the doctor wrote down, but it wasn't the
one that counted. The truth was, she wore out. Just wore thin and
then wore through, like a shirtsleeve at the elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   In his entire life, Chappell has spent only nine months living
outside the South: In 1967-68, he and his wife lived in Florence,
Italy, courtesy of a Rockefeller Foundation grant. Since 1964,
Chappell has taught literature and creative writing at the
University of North Carolina-Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching is what I do for a living. It's my vocation. ...
That's how I think of myself.'' After the instinctive pause of a
storyteller, he adds slyly, ``That's not always how my students
think of me. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, Chappell rises at 5 or 5:30 and writes for
four hours. ``And then, after that, I owe my soul to the company
store,'' he says. From early October until spring, schoolwork
generally ``overtakes'' him, and writing time has to be squeezed
into his daily routine whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   He composes everything in longhand _ poetry in pencil, fiction
in pen. ``I think it's nice to feel the pressure of your
personality on your words,'' he explains. ``You can't get that on a
computer. ... Plus, it just doesn't look right to sit in a bar and
type on a computer, but it's perfectly legitimate to sit in a bar
with a pen and scribble poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   When a poem or a chapter is ready, he often reads aloud to his
wife of 39 years, Susan. ``Mostly I trust her judgment,'' he says.
``Sometimes she's just dead wrong, but mostly I trust her
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell's soft-spoken manner and old-school charm allows his
self-deprecating humor to sneak up on you. He takes his work
seriously but never himself. It's a mind-set he tried to impress
upon students at Georgia College &AMP; State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, failure is my stock in trade,'' he said in his
convocation address Aug. 19. ``Every book I have published, every
poem I have written, is but a dim and scrawny shadow of the one
that was in my mind when I sat down to compose.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he explains, ``failure that comes after the best
possible effort has been put forth'' is not only acceptable but
honorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked upon this earth for 62 summers and have observed
statesmen and starlets, administrators and apple-pickers, warriors
and weavers, and scholars and students by the hundreds and have
concluded that those who succeeded rarely did so because of
brilliance of intellect or superabundance of talent. They succeeded
through strength of character _ which in some cases amounted to
arrant stupidity: They were too dumb to know when they were licked
or too stubborn to admit defeat when it was over them like thermal
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Chappell's convocation visit, all incoming
freshmen were required to read his novel ``Brighten the Corner
Where You Are'' (1989) and come to school prepared to discuss the
book in ``circles'' with faculty, staff and community members. At
several events during orientation, Chappell spent time talking to
the students, most of whom were new to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting Fred Chappell was magical for many of these
students,'' says Rosemary DePaolo, second-year president of the
college. ``He both entertained them and stretched them. He expected
them to know certain things ... so now in class they want to learn
about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell's appearance was part of the college's newly defined
mission to focus on being _ proudly and unapologetically _ a
liberal arts university. As a teacher, a writer and a dedicated
student of the classics, Chappell is happy to do what he can to
help the cause. His roots in education extend even beyond his 34
years on the Greensboro campus: His parents were both
schoolteachers until, ``curious about what it would be like to
eat,'' they went into the retail furniture business. ``But our
house was always full of books,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell is working now to conclude a story line that he began
in 1971, centering on the character of Joe Robert Kirkman,
protagonist in the four-cycle poem ``Midquest'' and three novels:
``I Am One of You Forever'' (1985), ``Brighten the Corner Where You
Are'' and ``Farewell, I'm Bound To Leave You.'' This fourth and
final novel in the series takes place after Joe Robert's death, as
his son Jess _ a thinly disguised, ``much nicer version'' of the
author as a boy and ultimately a man _ searches into his father's
life to see if he can understand this strange, eccentric figure.
</P>
<P>
   In a passage from the unfinished novel, Chappell reintroduces
Joe Robert:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you have seen the posters for the freaky old science
fiction movies of the 1950s. The muscular intrepid spaceman, having
arrived in a distant planet, steps out of his rocket, ray gun in
hand, to save the horrified blond damsel from the clutches of some
ill-tempered ambulatory fungus with too many tentacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my father, rescuing the Princess of Rational Thought
from the Superstition Monster _ only his spacesuit is such a one as
Charlie Chaplin might wear: ill-fitting and spotted with leaky
Band-Aids, equipped with a fishbowl helmet direly in need of
Windex. Upon close inspection his superscience ray gun turns out to
be a water pistol. The damsel in distress, bearded and balding,
bears an unfortunate resemblance to Charles Darwin.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of closing the books on the fictional lives of Joe
Robert and his family triggers some jumbled emotions in the writer
who created them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it will feel like to be through with it,''
Chappell says. ``It might feel like I've lost a limb. And a lot of
writers go into a deep, dark depression when they finish a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I feel a great sense of relief when I'm done with a
book, but this one I have a little apprehension about. It just
feels a little ragged to me. Terry Kay called the other night,
though ... and said every writer he knows hates the book when he
finishes it. So that's giving me some hope.''

 &HT;    Will John's score for ``Aida'' lead pack of new fall shows?
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_All ears will be on Atlanta this fall. The reason:
Broadway is starved for catchy melody and smart lyric, the
specialty of Elton John and Tim Rice. Their Disney/Alliance Theatre
musical, ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida'' (previewing Sept.
17) is expected to move to New York in early 1999, provided that
the British hit makers' sound can grab sophisticated young adults
the way their score for ``The Lion King'' delights families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives'' is just one of the tantalizing unknown
quantities of the new season's musicals. For instance, can
Atlanta-bred playwright Alfred Uhry tailor popular entertainment
from the city's notorious Leo Frank case of 1913? Will
``Footloose'' lose its dizzy charm in translation from film to
stage?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the critical long-term question is whether kings of pop
songwriting from the past three decades _ exemplified by John _ can
revitalize musical theater. Can they fill the void that gapes as
such old masters as Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, John Kander and
Fred Ebb enter their sunset years? Can they pick up the slack as
London-based hit meisters Andrew Lloyd Webber, Alain Bloublil and
Claude- Michel Schonberg slow their creative pace?
</P>
<P>
   Of the middle-aged pop kings, Paul Simon, Jimmy Buffett, Barry
Manilow and Randy Newman have scored only mixed success in their
theatrical debuts over the past two years. They could use
encouragement, and a successful outing by John _ in Atlanta, and
later in Gotham _ would give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Following are fall's most noteworthy Broadway tuners.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Little Me.'' Martin Short, a terrific singer as well as
comedian, plays the riotous multicharacter role created by Sid
Caesar in 1962. The divine Faith Prince plays the daffy femme
fatale who has the deja vu sensation of marrying the same man over
and over again. This star power is essential, because as we saw at
the Alliance two seasons ago, the score and Neil Simon book are
problematic. (Previews Sept. 30, opens Oct. 29, Roundabout
Theatre.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Footloose.'' It's an adaptation of the popular 1980s film
about a kid who sets his heartland town a-boogeyin' with forbidden
dance. A squad of songwriters (including Kenny Loggins) beefed up
the Tom Snow score, which includes the Oscar-nominated ``Let's Hear
It for the Boy.'' Trying out at Washington's Kennedy Center on
Tuesday through Sept. 20, the new show boasts red-hot director
Walter Bobbie of ``Chicago'' fame. (Previews Oct. 2, opens Oct. 22,
Richard Rodgers.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``On the Town.'' The great choreographer Jerome Robbins, who
died this month, conceived this 1944 musical about three sailors
getting every inch out of their last 24-hour shore leave, a
dizzying tour of the City in its prime. Featuring ``New York, New
York,'' the show bursts with the youthful joie de vivre of Robbins
and three other creators in their 20s: Leonard Bernstein (music),
Betty Comden and Adolph Green (book and lyrics). The revival is
produced and directed by George C. Wolfe (``Bring in 'da Noise,
Bring in 'da Funk'') and his Joseph Papp Public Theatre/New York
Shakespeare Festival. (Previews Oct. 20, opens Nov. 19, Gershwin.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Parade.'' A girl's mysterious murder in the Deep South, an
anti-Semitic mob, a press-circus trial, a lynching ... all the
elements of an American musical, right? Then again, in the words of
Uhry, ``A show about death at sea (``Titanic'') won a Tony, so who
knows?'' Indeed. Uhry, known for a gentle, mostly comic approach to
Atlanta characters (``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``The Last Night of
Ballyhoo'') delves into the darker side of his hometown's history
with his musical book about the infamous Leo Frank case of 1913.
The premiere is co-produced by Livent (``Ragtime'') and Lincoln
Center, with Hal Prince (``The Phantom of the Opera'') directing.
(Previews Nov. 12, opens Dec. 17, Beaumont.)

NOW `TITANIC' GOES BY TRUCK  
 NEW VIDEO RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how big it will get. But big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing approaches this,'' said Stan Meyers, executive vice
president of Baker &AMP; Taylor, the country's second largest video
distributor. After many years in the business, Meyers has seen the
biggest: ``The Lion King'' (the very biggest), ``Jurassic Park,''
``Forrest Gump,'' ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, casting a larger shadow across the landscape than
the spaceship in ``Independence Day'' (the second biggest), comes
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   No centralized count is available, but dealers say that about 26
million copies of the film, to be released Sept. 1 by Paramount,
are now in the distribution pipeline. The studio won't confirm that
figure, only that it took 6.5 million miles of videotape (260 times
around the planet) to fill the videocassettes that are, in turn,
packing, by the studio's estimate, the 1,000 tractor-trailer trucks
needed to get all that plastic to stores by midnight Monday, when
``Titanic,'' priced at $19.95, officially goes on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lay those trucks bumper to bumper and, Paramount has calculated,
the convoy would stretch 40 miles. Bob Webb, a vice president of
Ingram, the country's largest video distributor, said a truck would
carry 38,000 copies of ``Titanic.'' But the film is on two tapes,
so if a tractor-trailer loses its contents on the highway, it could
require the cleanup of 76,000 videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, all those millions of cassettes would send the
Titanic, along with a container ship or two, straight to the
bottom. How many of them will finally be bought by consumers can't
be determined, of course, but retailers say that millions of
advance orders from fans indicate that the first shipments will be
sold out during the first few weeks. That, they add, will lead to
heavy reordering. ``We're already seeing that,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, the nation's largest chain, promises there will be
copies enough for everybody come release day. That puts pressure on
other chains to follow suit. ``We're guaranteed to have it, and if
we don't, people will get a free rental,'' said Julie Gschwend, a
vice president of Video Avenue, a chain of 20 stores in South
Florida. Each store, she said, will stock 200 rental copies and
between 200 and 300 copies for sale. So far the chain has logged
more than 8,500 pre-orders, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial shipment phase ``The Lion King'' tallied 22
million copies, with about 30 million ultimately sold to consumers.
On the basis of its 26 million-copy start, ``Titanic'' may well
exceed that.
</P>
<P>
   All the factors that made the movie the biggest box-office
attraction ever are expected to weigh in once again for the video.
``There's Leo,'' said Larry Moyer, a manager of Video Stop, a chain
in Oregon and southern Washington, referring to Leonardo DiCaprio,
the film's megastar, a major draw for millions of adolescent girls.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, no matter how many times they may have watched the
movie in theaters, have figured strongly in the presale, and they
are expected to be a presence at ``Titanic''-related festivities at
many stores on release day. Blockbuster stores will stay open
Monday night until 2 a.m. (actually Tuesday morning). In Florida,
Video Avenue stores will stay open past midnight. The pizza will be
free.

   Mangling some Arthur Miller dialogue, Joe (Matthew Modine) lands
an assignment in a Madonna video. Meanwhile, his girlfriend
(Catherine Keener) takes self-defense classes and helps primp a
supermodel named Sahara (Bridgette Wilson) for spreads shot by
Blair (Marlo Thomas), a voraciously intense fashion photographer
who knows all about taking pictures but nothing about what they
represent. Finally, there's Joe's friend Bob (Maxwell Caulfield), a
smirky, sex-obsessed type on the prowl for a genuine blonde. Using
a sharp satirical eye, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
Tom DiCillio ``directed this shrewd comedy with a sharp notion of
exactly what he wants to skewer.'' &QL;

   In Bertrand Tavernier's film, the fiery, war-loving Conan
(Philippe Torreton) has trouble accepting the fact that World War I
is at an end and that he must disband his French irregulars
fighting on in the Balkans. Providing a temperamental and
philosophical counterpoint is the intellectual Lieutenant Norbert
(Samuel Le Bihan), the story's resident ethicist. While a hand-held
camera probes everywhere during trench warfare, memorably ambiguous
characters carry out an elaborate moral inquiry in a ``vast yet
subtle film'' (Maslin).

   Brooklyn streets are ingrained in the brand of basketball and
the people who play it in Danielle Gardner's pulsating documentary.
At the center of the story are the blustering Kenny Jones,
organizer and patriarch of Kenny's Kings, and his star guard Ed
(Booger) Smith. A tireless self-promoter, Jones is macho mother hen
to his players off the court and their loud, crude advocate on it.
Booger, on the other hand, coolly slides by and for a short time
becomes the New York playground prize of an Arizona junior college.
Soon, though, he's back in Brooklyn, swallowed up by the big city
from which he came in a film that lacks the sociological impact of
``Hoop Dreams'' and ``remains predominantly upbeat and utterly

Lucy (Kelly Lynch), who is the operation's packager. Later the trio
notices that the entire crop still stands unmolested by rippers

   NANOOK OF THE NORTH. Long a staple in the silent-film public
domain, Robert Flaherty's famous 1920 documentary (or photoplay, as
it was called then) about the hardships of an Eskimo hunter and his

   THE BRIDGE. During the last few days of World War II in Europe,
the Nazis rounded up seven teen-age boys from a high school, threw
them into uniform and sent them out to defend a bridge in the path
of the advancing Allies. Actually, the Germans had planned to
withdraw them before the attack arrived and blow up the bridge, but
the sergeant who knew that information was killed before he could
so inform the students, who are left to be mowed down. It's not
pretty. If combat scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan'' are

 &HT;    Pearl Jam slows flow of angst
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 30: DO NOT USE UNTIL THEN)
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _By all rights, Pearl Jam ought to be the
Band That Time Forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Choice and circumstance has, in recent years, sidelined the
once-dominant Seattle rock group. Its efforts to grow beyond the
formative ``grunge'' sound it helped to incubate in the early
1990s, and its past refusal to make rock videos or play music
venues whose ticketing is controlled by Ticketmaster, has cost the
group. While album sales shrank _ down to 1.3 million for its
flawed, ambitiously introspective ``No Code'' (1996) _ a new
generation of copycat acts launched careers by emulating the
musical postures that Pearl Jam has struggled to subvert.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if this is a band destined for nostalgia's dustbin, as some
critics have asserted, you wouldn't know it tonight.
</P>
<P>
   As more than 12,000 fans roar their approval at Michigan State
University's Breslin Arena, the five musicians respond in kind.
Bellowing at the limit of his lungs as guitars snarl and slash
behind him, Eddie Vedder slumps against the microphone stand, hair
obscuring his face, body limp, like he's about to collapse around
the wine bottle near his feet. The only part of the vocalist that
appears to work is his mouth, and it consumes
</P>
<P>
   everything around him. ``The whole world,'' he sings _ or,
rather, yodels, howls, groans _ ``will be different / The whoooole
</P>
<P>
   world. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Vedder, 32, intends a promise, a threat or some sort of
mockery, it's hard to know. He's a sincere enigma. But for Pearl
Jam the lyrics are already fact. The world, for this band, is
different. Embarked on its first major American tour since 1994,
when it began a quixotic battle against concert ticket-sales
monolith Ticketmaster, the group has emerged with the strongest
work of its career. Much as Pearl Jam's live performance, its new
album ``Yield'' (Epic) flaunts the musicians' knack for agile,
muscular thrash _ Vedder's every wail a protest against the nature
of existence. But more persuasively, songs such as the gorgeous
reverie ``Given to Fly'' detail complex emotions in ballads that
emphasize the ruddy textures in Vedder's voice, with folk-rock
foundations that draw on the gentler side of such '70s icons as
Neil Young and Led Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Yield'' (Grade: A) might imply that Pearl Jam is
giving in. The group is now playing Ticketmaster venues. A video
clip for the song ``Do the Evolution'' is being offered to MTV,
with a live rehearsal documentary ``Single Video Theory'' also
available for sale. The band's members, traditionally wary of the
media, have been talking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, says bassist Jeff Ament, is the band was eager to
return to performance. It was time to take the pressure off. ``You
go back and forth depending on what day it is,'' he says, alluding
to the group's bruised, but intact, integrity. ``OK, I'm gonna do
this and this and this, I'm gonna make my relationships better and
my family life better and my business better. Some days you wake up
and you don't give a (darn), you don't want to have to worry about
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   No band this decade has fretted so much, reaching a commercial
peak with its first album ``10'' in 1991, and then beating a steady
retreat from stardom. Major pop personas such as Bruce Springsteen
and Prince have made significant midcareer shifts, for example, by
staging a solo acoustic tour or releasing new work in three or
four-CD chunks that only hard-core fans can fully appreciate. It's
a rock 'n' roll version of downsizing that can give a creatively
crowded performer some breathing room (or perhaps encourage foolish
self-indulgence). Pearl Jam made of this a drama equal to the
tensions that propel its songs.
</P>
<P>
   As one fan, 24-year-old Jim Delacorte of Westland, Mich., puts
it: ``Whatever's popular, Eddie does the opposite and sees who's
going to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   His buddy, Rick Bennett, 25, of Ypsilanti, Mich., offers a
similar perspective. ``These guys come from a whole different
era,'' he says. ``They wanted to separate the wannabe fans from the
true fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. While the band launched its own voyage of discovery _
touring and recording behind kindred spirit Young, for instance,
or, as Vedder did, collaborating with the late Pakistani vocal star
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan _ the moody, dynamic swings of its guitars
and cries of rage and dysfunction were adopted by such groups as
Stone Temple Pilots, Live and Silverchair. Meanwhile, the ``heavy''
factor that once occupied radio station playlists influenced by
Pearl Jam and its Seattle neighbors Nirvana, was eroded by the soft
pop-rock of such phenomena as Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish and Jewel. It
didn't help that the band often seemed to be shooting itself in the
foot rather than slaying its corporate nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group, despite a steady number of high visibility bouts of
conscience, has managed to slip to the margins of the American
public's musical radar,'' observes Christopher Hawthorne, arts
editor of the East Bay Express in Berkeley, Calif., writing
recently in the Webzine Salon. ``While following other bands on
their voyages of musical self-discovery _ like the Beastie Boys,
say, who've never lost their sense of humor _ has been effortlessly
entertaining, with Pearl Jam it's always felt like a bit of a
slog.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough: Vedder's brooding, his air of refusal, seems
utterly perverse in this era of all-out celebrity saturation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole band got a little full of itself,'' says
Megan Frampton, senior director of sales and marketing for CMJ
publications, which include the trade magazine CMJ Monthly. An
early fan of the group, Frampton began attending Pearl Jam shows
when the band was still known by its original name, Mookie
Blaylock. ``I just haven't been interested. I don't know why. The
punk ethic doesn't really suit a stadium-filler band.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's a significant part of Pearl Jam's _ and Vedder's _
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's probably one of the major icons of pop music who's
kept his anonymity throughout,'' says Jay Young, a 19-year-old
Michigan fan who scratches his goatee as he hangs out with friends
at the show. ``They prove that their music speaks for itself. You
don't seem them on TV every five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   When everything in pop music can be construed as a franchise,
when every classic tune is just another jingle for a car
commercial, Pearl Jam might be that little mom 'n' pop store on the
dirt road under the new interstate. It's a band asserting a kind of
modesty in an immodest age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about artists seizing control,'' says Ted Mankin, an
Atlanta-based promoter with Cellar Door, which has produced Pearl
Jam concerts in the region. ``It's about taking back control and
taking care of the people that got you there and having a career.
They (careers) can go by in a blur if you don't make it special
somehow. Just as quickly as the momentum can build it can deflate.
It's hard, though. You lose some people along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though 18,000 tickets have been sold for the band's Atlanta
show, its new album has been steadily slipping down the charts.
Sitting at No. 166 after 27 weeks, ``Yield'' has sold a
million-plus copies. So has ``My Own Prison'' by Creed, a slavishly
derivative act whose sound is nearly identical to grunge knockoffs
Bush, a band indebted to Pearl Jam and Nirvana for its sound. After
45 weeks in release, the Creed disc is at No. 22, demonstrating
that there's still mileage left in post-adolescent wallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam is trying to relate to adulthood. ``You don't have to
represent yourself as the (tortured), angst-ridden artist all the
time,'' contends Ament, 35, calling from his home in Missoula,
Mont., during a break in the tour. ``It's not always that way. You
don't have to die at 26 and shoot drugs and be drunk all the time
along the way to create something good. It's easier to write those
kinds of songs and write those kinds of books because you tend to
be more inspired to put out those things when you're in that mode.
I'm not gonna hold it back and turn myself into a monster. I've
seen a lot of people do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from neurotic, world-beating rock supergroup to a
mature band in full control of its fortunes was necessary, if not
terrifically sexy. ``When you don't have any perspective, when
you're selling 10 million records and you don't know what that is,
and then you look around you and your friends aren't selling as
many records, you kind of wonder why,'' Ament continues, looking
back on the band's evolution. ``Those bands are at least as good as
we are. That provided some insecurity. You get a little paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not Vedder's stance tonight. Not the furtive Garbo some
have labeled him, he's talkative, downright chummy at times. He
makes speeches about campus censorship and summer romances,
revisits the band's biggest hits _ ``Jeremy'' and ``Alive'' _
which, defiant as they are, have become fraternity-row anthems, and
impressively moves between stirring, hymnlike confessionals (the
quiet ``Wishlist'') and more vigorously driven material (explosive
riff-fests such as ``Do the Evolution'' and ``Brain of J.''). It's
a substantive performance, in which themes of resistance and
redemption seem designed to fill a void.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, for an encore, Vedder does something
funny. Ha ha funny. He pledges his love to a guy in the audience,
and plucks him onstage _ wow, just like Bruce Springsteen does for
the unknown Courteney Cox in the ``Dancing in the Dark'' video _
only to send him back for dressing inappropriately: wearing an
offending Michigan jersey on rival turf, no less. Then, Vedder
invites a college-age woman to join him. She's gaga, you know, but
she gets it together because the singer has a task for her. He
hands her a book of lyrics to hold while he performs a song the
band has barely rehearsed. It's called ``Soldier of Love,'' by the
late, great Memphis songwriter Arthur Alexander, a soulful ditty
from 1962, a good 20 years before some of these fans were born.
</P>
<P>
   As he tentatively proceeds toward the chorus, which everyone is
encouraged to clap and sing along with, Vedder is neither the
roiling conscience of an uncertain generation nor a sullen
anti-star grumbling as he dodges fame's arrow. He's just a guy
who'd be as clumsy as you'd be standing in front of a bunch of
people, a little wine in your belly, trying to sing something sweet
from a forgotten jukebox to a pretty girl you'd only just met.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Vedder has to laugh. And, for a couple of minutes, the
world laughs with him.

`MIDSOMER MURDERS': THAT PROFITABLE PROPHET COMMUNED WITH DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strange things are afoot again in the Buckinghamshire village of
Midsomer,  &QL; 
this time at the Lodge of the Golden Wind Horse. That's a comfy
commune whose paying customers hope to be transported to a higher
spiritual plane. Trouble is, some people there are leaving this
lower plane rather abruptly. Dead, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this series isn't called ``Midsomer Murders'' for nothing.
Dark mysteries lurk beneath the bright blue skies. But Chief
Inspector Tom Barnaby is determined to straighten things out. He
always does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death in Disguise,'' this two-part tale of old-fashioned
deception under New Age trappings, is the third of five A&AMP;E
``Midsomer'' dramas, based on the novels of Caroline Graham. The
first hour of this charmingly lightweight diversion begins at 10
Friday night, with the loose ends tied into a conclusion next
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby (John Nettles) is first summoned to the lodge by one of
its residents, May Cuttle (Judy Cornwell), a dotty, cello-playing
woman of a certain age. One of the commune's two founders, William
Carter (Robert Pickavance), has taken a fatal plunge down a flight
of stairs after a loud argument with the other founder, Ian Craigie
(Michael Feast), the long-haired mystic known to his followers as
the Master.
</P>
<P>
   A tragic accident? Barnaby wonders, although his eager young
aide, Sgt. Troy (Daniel Casey), is not inclined to see foul play.
Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But as Barnaby begins to discover, some of the people seeking
enlightenment at the lodge are also seeking to escape from life's
complications. That includes Suhami (Anna Bolt), who turns out to
be an heiress, the very estranged 18-year-old daughter of a nasty
tycoon (Miles Anderson), who makes the mistake of showing up at the
lodge for a visit and further tarnishes the tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   And what a coincidence! Another resident, Trixie (Tilly
Blackwood), is the tycoon's discarded girlfriend. ``We had a
zoological fling,'' he snorts to the inspector. ``It lasted three
days.'' She hasn't forgiven him, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Master, who started the commune looking for
profit but has begun to warm to his role as prophet. Alas, he, too,
is ``astrally harvested,'' as one of his followers puts it,
dispatched with the knife used to carve the evening's nut roast.
Vegetarian diet, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   As all the two-dimensional characters bluster about, nearly
tripping over the red herrings planted in the script, the
three-dimensional Barnaby looks for answers, earnestly determined
to make sense of it all. You can try to sort things out before he
does, or let your mind fall into step with him. Either way, the
time will fly.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles' portrayal of the decent detective, rounded out by brief
glimpses of his home life with a loving wife and daughter, keeps
the proceedings from floating away on a cloud of froth. Not that
there's a serious moment in these two hours. This is not memorable
drama, spine-chilling melodrama or arch satire. But it is a
restorative trip to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it includes a bit of death. But that's life.

`I MARRIED A STRANGE PERSON!': MIND OVER MATTER, LITERALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kerry's new husband, Grant, begins doing peculiar things _
like making a swarm of insects suddenly appear around his
mother-in-law's head _ Kerry begins to wonder exactly what kind of
man she has just vowed to spend her life with. Is he a robot, she
wonders, the anti-Christ, a space alien, the Messiah? ``Oh, no,
it's worse than I thought,'' she concludes. ``He's working for the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't, actually. It's just that Smilecorp, the conglomerate
that wants to steal Grant's newfound superpowers, has its own
private army, so there are a lot of soldiers and tanks around.
</P>
<P>
   You could, however, watch all of Bill Plympton's animated film
``I Married a Strange Person!'' without figuring that out. The
story is a standard linear narrative, but the filmmaker seems
reluctant to spell out the plot developments clearly.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the movie, Grant, a square-jawed hunk of a
cartoon nice guy, develops a bump on the back of his neck. The bump
gives him the power to make things happen just by thinking about
them. This includes turning his wife into any woman he's
fantasizing about during lovemaking. Soon he's on a television talk
show, billed as an illusionist. As a result, Smilecorp's chief
executive officer, the head of its army and a washed-up comedian
named Solly all try to get their hands on Grant's bump. The chase
is on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plympton is clearly an inventive animator with great visual
style, including the animation equivalent of terrific camera
angles, but feature film may not be the best form for appreciating
his talents. An hour and 54 minutes is an awful lot of
shape-shifting humans, graphic sex scenes (sometimes between
normally inanimate objects), bloody body parts and exploding lawn
ornaments at one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Plympton's animation is aggressive, to say the least, sometimes
grotesque and definitely not to everyone's taste. The film begins
with a pair of flying ducks having sex in midair and ends with what
looks like a woman tying a man's hands together with his own
intestine. On the gentler side, Grant also has the power to stop a
bullet speeding toward his head by turning it into a hero sandwich.

``THE SEA'': AN EVIL INTRUDER IN FAMILY PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``See the Sea'' and ``A Summer Dress'' were shown as part of
this year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts
from the review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 31.
The films open Friday at the Quad Cinema in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Ozon's ``See the Sea'' is set at the Ile d'Yeu, a
French beach community, and filmed so precisely that it seems to
observe every grain of sand. Discreetly terrifying in the way that
only a tranquil, sunlit setting can be, the island is the backdrop
for an insinuating two-character story. An Englishwoman named Sasha
(Sasha Hails) is seen spending time in privileged isolation with
her baby daughter, as the camera carefully records the simple
rhythm of her days. Then a rude, sullen backpacker named Tatiana
(Marina de Van) appears and announces her intention to camp in
Sasha's yard. ``See the Sea,'' which is brief and expertly
chilling, watches an uneasy rapport develop between these two.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha is wary at first, but she is also lonely and complacent
enough to begin letting down her guard. She decides to share meals
with Tatiana. She grows curious about Tatiana's red tent and, at
one point, grows flirtatious enough to slip into a sundress that
matches it. And she flaunts her obvious love for the baby, an
especially delicious-looking toddler. Either this child is a
fabulous actress or she is Miss Hails' own daughter. She wails
pitiably every time her screen mother walks away.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time, and an occasion for profound alarm,
before Sasha has grown oblivious enough to leave the baby in
Tatiana's care. What happens next is not instantly horrific, but it
draws out the deep fears that Ozon plays upon so exquisitely. In a
film of such stark simplicity and visual elegance, the isolated
hints of Tatiana's fury are as potent as gunfire. The camera's few
minutes alone in the bathroom with her are reason enough for Sasha
to be heading for the next ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon, whose eerie exactitude owes strong debts to Chabrol and
Polanski, builds this simple film to unexpected heights of irony
and horror. Late in the story, for instance, the two women share
dinner as Tatiana abruptly asks Sasha what childbirth was like. In
complacent yuppie fashion, Sasha proudly answers that she took no
drugs because she wanted to experience the pain. All Tatiana has to
do to set your hair on end at a moment like this is simply to
listen, her expression perfectly blank, her eyes dead.
</P>
<P>
   The profoundly unsettling ``See the Sea,'' with its potent
undercurrents of sexual frustration and longing, runs only 52
minutes but packs a feature-length wallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Summer Dress,'' a 15-minute short by the same filmmaker,
uses a similar beach setting and similar visual style to vastly
different purpose. This time, in the story of a gay man who is
seduced by a woman and then vacillates between her and his male
lover, the tactics are similar but the effect is far more light.

QUALITY TEACHERS EMERGING FROM U.S. MILITARY TROOPS, SURVEYS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A five-year program called Troops to Teachers that
has sent more than 3,000 veterans to the classroom has proved to be
a boon for states needing good educators, according to surveys
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As it was downsizing the military, the Defense Department
started the TTT program in 1994 to help people find second careers
in teaching. Two federal grants of $65 million each funded the
program, which has placed teachers in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, California, Florida and Virginia have benefited most from
the program, with each hiring more than 200 vets. The program is
scheduled to end in October 1999, according to its director, John
Gantz.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys of more than 1,100 teachers and 380 school
principals found that overwhelmingly they have been satisfied with
the program. The teacher survey was conducted by the National
Center for Education Information (NCEI), a Washington-based
research organization, and the administrator poll was taken by TTT
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-one percent of the teachers who responded said they liked
their jobs, and about 70 percent of the administrators who hired
the veterans ranked them ``among the best'' teachers or ``well
above average'' or ``above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Eden Reyes, a former Air Force computer operator who teaches
fifth grade at Landrum Elementary in San Benito, Texas., about 10
miles northwest of Brownsville, said at a news conference here that
his military experience has helped him in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the most important skill he learned in his 20-year
military career was how to be a positive role model. Many of his
pupils are growing up in one-parent families, he said, and many
``have brothers, fathers, uncles in prison. From me they need to
see there is a different way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in teaching he has also relied on his experiences
working with computers, maintaining discipline, staying calm in
difficult situations and living in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In social studies, Reyes said, he shares with his students
first-hand knowledge about European countries. That excites his
students, he added, making ``them feel like they, too, have the
potential to one day visit those places.'' As a south Texas native,
he said, he wants his students to know that ``the sky's the
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   George C. Willett, director of the Washington state TTT program,
reported that teachers in the program often say, ``This is
something I've always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Osteen, principal of Lake Taylor High school in Norfolk,
Va., said of one teacher he hired from the program: ``He demanded
the best from every student without acting like the stereotypical
drill sergeant.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Emily Feistritzer, director of the education information
center, said 90 percent of teachers in the TTT program are male and
noted that the field they have entered is dominated by females.
More of the TTT teachers _ 29 percent _ are from minority groups,
compared with about 10 percent generally in the field, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports said 29 percent of TTT teachers are mathematics
instructors, compared with 13 percent of teachers nationally. Ten
percent of the TTT veterans are special education teachers, double
the national rate. Thirty-eight percent of TTT educators teach
biology, chemistry and physics compared with 26 percent of regular
public school teachers in those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Feistritzer said former military personnel are also more willing
to teach in ``combat zones'' such as the inner-city or rural towns.
Twenty-four percent of TTT instructors are in the inner-city
compared with 16 percent of regular teachers, she said.

`FAMILY-FRIENDLY' PAX GOES FOR A PIECE OF THE TV PIE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The symbolic birth of the PAX TV network is a ripe slice of
business legerdemain.
</P>
<P>
   It's late in the 1970s. Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson owns a little AM
radio station in Florida. An advertising client owes him a thousand
dollars. The client refuses to pay but instead offers Paxson an
overstock supply of 112 electric can openers. Paxson loads them
into his van.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, on his radio station, Paxson seized the
microphone and offered the can openers to listeners for $9.75
apiece. The station's five phone lines lit up. In 15 minutes, the
can openers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson parlayed that day's revelation into television's Home
Shopping Network, then into a string of penny-ante UHF TV stations,
and now into a weird network that will crackle to life at noon
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Now mega-wealthy and a born-again Christian, Paxson is seeking a
``family-friendly'' niche in the broadcasting spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   That supposedly means no gratuitous sex, violence or raw
language. Accordingly, Paxson has stocked his new network with a
few sterilized original shows and such off-network reruns as
``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV is expected to reach about 70 percent of the nation's TV
homes in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The network's launch is backed by a $25 million advertising
campaign, and the goal is to gain a 1 percent share of the national
viewing audience within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone tuned in at noon Monday will see, barring a Paxson
disaster, the debut of an informational and celebrity-interview
show called ``Great Day America.'' You get the impression that the
whole PAX TV audience will be people who wake up at sunrise,
stretch their arms and say to themselves, ``It's a great day,
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a bit odd because the president of the new network,
working under chairman Paxson, is Jeff Sagansky, the sad-eyed
former programming chief at CBS. Bud Paxson is an outsider still
based in Florida. Sagansky is a Hollywood insider. Paxson is a
tub-thumping Christian. Sagansky is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels he has this calling from God,'' Sagansky recently
said of his new boss. ``I don't feel the same calling.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Sagansky who'll oversee such original programming as
``It's a Miracle,'' a studio-based show about the power of faith,
and ``Cloud Nine,'' the umbrella title for kiddie cartoons hosted
by a trio of winged teen angels.
</P>
<P>
   Those are weekend shows. The weeknight prime-time schedule is
centered on reruns of ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman'' and ``Diagnosis Murder.'' The likes of ``Eight Is
Enough,'' ``The Hogan Family,'' ``Here's Lucy'' and ``The Love
Boat'' are also sprinkled around the PAX TV schedule.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that PAX TV had its official introduction to
network life even before its launch, when CBS filed suit earlier
this month to stop production of a ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''
special for PAX TV. CBS owns the show, which it canceled in May,
and claims the special is unauthorized. So already PAX TV is duking
it out in litigation with the source of much of its programming.
</P>
<P>
   Not even on the air yet, and already PAX TV is Touched by a
Lawyer.

WILLIAM HOGARTH ART REVIEW: SHARP EYE (AND WIT) FOR FOIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not many visual artists view their work as plays or novels, but
that was how the English satirist and social critic William Hogarth
(1697-1756) saw his. He spun out scathing sagas in the form of
paintings and engravings, produced in series like the famous
eight-part ``Rake's Progress'' (1735) and the six-chapter
``Marriage a la Mode'' (1745).
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth, whose gift for genre helped to breed the first really
English style of painting since the Middle Ages, was part of the
great era of English satire. Manners, morals, culture and politics
came under his comic and cynical scrutiny, and he compared his work
to the wittily moralizing novels of his contemporaries Henry
Fielding (on whom he had considerable influence) and Daniel Defoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have endeavored to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer,''
Hogarth wrote. ``My picture is my stage and men and women my
players, who by means of certain actions and gestures are to
exhibit a dumb show.'' Using a wealth of often symbolic detail, he
translated the novelistic into visual terms. Most of his prints
demand ``reading'' with the same focused attention as a meaty book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Age of Hogarth: Paintings and Prints from the Collection
of Earle W. Newton, '38,'' at the Mead Art Museum at Amherst
College, celebrates, slightly belatedly, the 300th anniversary of
Hogarth's birth in 1697 and provides an engaging precis of his
work. Included are a selection from his larger thematic groups of
engravings, lesser-known single prints and a few paintings,
although only one is by Hogarth himself. The rest are by followers
or contemporaries, including two fine portraits by Joseph Wright of
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The material is drawn from the extensive holdings of Newton, an
alumnus of the college who went on to found American Heritage
Magazine and to nurture a lifelong interest in the Georgian period
and Anglo-American history.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth's use of novelistic detail runs riot in ``A Rake's
Progress'' (probably the best-known of his works today because of
its reprise as an opera by Igor Stravinsky). As was his custom, he
began it as a series of canvases, partly inspired by French rococo
and Dutch genre painting, from which he made engravings for popular
dissemination. (People followed prints in the 18th century almost
the way they do, say, episodes of Masterpiece Theater today.)
</P>
<P>
   It tells the story of Tom Rakewell, a cad and a spendthrift who
dissipates his miserly father's fortune in drink, gambling and
womanizing, ending up in a madhouse. Scene 3 of the series, on view
here, shows assorted wastrels carousing around a tavern table, as
the inebriated Rakewell, in disheveled finery, is groped by one
woman while another steals his watch. The sleazy company also
includes two quarreling whores (one spits a stream of gin at the
other); a ``posture woman'' who is disrobing to gyrate naked on a
platter for the guests' amusement; a pregnant street singer holding
a lewd ballad, and a prostitute who sets fire to a map of the
world. They carry on in a shambles of broken dishes and
wineglasses, spilled food and drink, defaced pictures on the walls.
The abundance of garrulous detail, with every figure socially
placed and characterized by Hogarth's brilliant graphic skills, is
overwhelming; in our age of Minimalism and jump cuts, it boggles
the mind.
</P>
<P>
   His moral outrage was more sensationally expressed in ``The Four
Stages of Cruelty'' (1750), a sort of ballad _ and, incidentally,
an animal-rights tract _ about a murderer and animal abuser, Tom
Nero, who is eventually hanged. The most grisly is the fourth
stage, ``The Reward of Cruelty,'' in which the dead Nero, the rope
still around his neck, is shown on a dissecting table being carved
up (a common practice after an execution) by a team of zealous
surgeons. As Nero's entrails are pulled out, a dog prepares to
feast on his discarded heart.
</P>
<P>
   But Hogarth was not always given to moral lessons. His single
print ``The Enraged Musician'' (1741) is pure social comedy,
mocking the distance between high culture and daily existence. In
it, an effete, bewigged musician, in royal garb and brandishing a
violin bow, leans protestingly out a window as the cacophony of
street life assails him. Peddlers bawl out their wares; an
impromptu band of music makers includes a child beating a drum; a
beggar woman cries for alms, dogs yap and a little boy urinates.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth was not above using his graphic talents for personal
invective. The most salient example is ``The Bruiser'' (1763), done
the year before his death. It is an attack on John Wilkes, a
journalist and politician, and Charles Churchill, a cleric, both of
whom had publicly maligned him, in part for his opposition to the
popular statesman William Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this vituperative putdown, Hogarth erased his own
cocky face from a self-portrait, ``Gulielmus Hogarth (Self-Portrait
With Pug)'' (1749), and put in its place a likeness of Churchill as
a big, drunken bear, holding a tankard of beer and drooling over
his clerical garb. Trump, the pug dog in the original self-portrait
is still there, but in this version he urinates on a copy of
Churchill's screed against Hogarth. An inset at the bottom right of
the print shows Hogarth whipping the bear, with Wilkes also present
in the guise of an ape. If all this seems slightly schoolboyish, it
was, but the work of an extraordinarily clever schoolboy who could
exploit a grudge with graphic genius.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth's last print, ``The Bathos or Tailpiece'' (planned as a
tailpiece to all his engraved works but not published until 1764),
is a punning allegorical summation, surreal in its content and
still managing to be funny. A comment on what he viewed as the
degeneration of England and at the same time a satire on the
romantic love of ruins expressed in the fashion for ``sublime''
paintings, it depicts the figure of Time, collapsed against a
ruined column, accompanied by a broken scythe and hourglass. He
breathes out the word ``Finis'' as he expires. Surrounding him are
such played-out props as a cracked bell and broken palette, the
ruins of a church and a tavern called the World's End, and in the
distance a hanged man.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies, political embroilments and disillusionment had sapped
Hogarth's cocky ebullience, but they didn't dim a talent that,
although steeped in the manners and mores of 18th-century England,
we can still relate to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Age of Hogarth: Paintings and Prints from the Collection
of Earle W. Newton '38'' remains at Mead Art Museum, Amherst
College, in Amherst, Mass., through Sept. 13.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Singletary a role model for Georgia public servants
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hugh Singletary wrote me a note about his father, Dr. H. Titus
Singletary Jr., who is critically ill with cancer in his Atlanta
home. He spent 35 of his 70 years as associate superintendent of
Georgia schools.
</P>
<P>
   His son Hugh and daughter, Anne Kinnan of Tampa, collaborated on
a tribute to their father, ending with these words: ``It's an honor
to have a role model like the one we've had. He has made such a
difference in the lives of so many. I am thankful to be a part of
his extraordinary journey.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a great journey from a Thomas County(Ga.) farm near
Thomasville, where he was born and where he first realized he
wanted to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Georgia remember _ and are glad for _ the gifts
he brought to public service. At the behest of her husband, former
Gov. George Busbee, Mary Beth Busbee called me about Dr.
Singletary. Let him know while he still lives, she said, how
valuable he is to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singletary began as a school teacher and gradually took his
ideas for the betterment of students and teachers to the top. He
met his future wife, Emmie Lane, when they taught side by side in a
country school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a grand office across from the Capitol,'' his daughter
wrote, ``but most of his time was spent in school classrooms and
face-to-face meetings with people in every facet of the school
system. He performed his job with passion that now seems
nonexistent in the hustle and bustle of today's workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   His family regards Dr. Singletary's ``passions'' as first his
children, then his friends, his church (Johnson Ferry Road Baptist)
and his beloved Georgia Bulldogs and Atlanta Braves. He progressed
to a great encompassing love of three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Georgia Southern College in Statesboro, served
four years as a drill sergeant during World War II and received his
doctorate degree from the University of Georgia. While he was
governor, former President Jimmy Carter appointed Dr. Singletary to
the office of associate superintendent of schools, a job considered
by educators to be the highest in the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singletary retired 18 years ago and promptly began serving
as principal of Woodland Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   He received many professional honors, but the work he did as a
prayer person and counselor, receiving calls from troubled people
at his church, was special and memorable.
</P>
<P>
   His children wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were blessed with a dad who will influence our daily life
forever. As he began to fight for his life, the week before his
grandson, Franklin, was born, he knew it would be a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extra bonus years we've had include my two brothers'
weddings, many wonderful holidays, (and) a special retreat in St.
Simons for fishing, walking the beach, and holding together the
family we deem so dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Busbee, who knew Dr. Singletary well and observed his
conduct of school affairs, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great leader in education in this state, as well as a
kind and compassionate gentleman. He was a very devoted family
person, and the professional awards and honors he received are too
many to enumerate.''

 &HT;    It's clear from Tamara Jenkins' new movie about adolescent
humiliations, that the writer-director has been there
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' writer-director Tamara Jenkins
turns Hollywood's obsession with teenage boys upside down: She
recalls those awkward years from a woman's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' movie, opening today, focuses on teenage Vivian
(Natasha Lyonne), who's coping with her nomadic, all-male family
and the humiliations of puberty. Especially when she goes from a
flat chest to a C-cup overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of experience with which most women can identify.
Not so men. Jenkins even tripped on a gender barrier while talking
to a movie executive about ``Slums.'' He remembered what a gas it
was, as a high schooler, to ogle and ``accidentally'' bump against
girls whose breasts had developed over the summer. She remembers it
quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think that was like for the girls?'' she asked
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female maturation is a very visible thing _ it's public, in a
way,'' Jenkins says of her first feature film, speaking from her
New York home. ``If an adolescent female gets breasts, it's like
they become a conversation piece for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums''' witty, honest look at the issues facing Vivian isn't
for everyone. ``Some men are really unnerved by the material,'' the
director says. ``But some people feel really liberated, because
they've never seen this presented before.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just a boy-girl reaction, either. New York gossip
columnist Cindy Adams left a press screening midway through but
showed up at the reception. ``She gave me this look, like I was the
dirtiest girl she had ever seen,'' Jenkins says. ``She rolled her
eyes up and down my body like, `You little trollop.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums'' is a fictional take on Jenkins' own youth as the only
girl in an all-male family after her parents' divorce. ``I wanted
to revisit teenage sexuality and growing up without guidance, and
having to figure things out in this all-male environment, in this
ridiculously rich town.''
</P>
<P>
   The script's earliest form has an Atlanta connection: Jenkins
began working on the material in the mid-1980s while acting at
Theater Works in Boston, a company run by Vincent Murphy and Tim
McDonough, now faculty members in the Emory University(Ga.) theater
studies department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worshipped them!'' Jenkins exclaims. ``Tim McDonough taught
me everything. He was so generous and brilliant and insightful.''
(The Emory professors also have a connection with the new movie
``Next Stop, Wonderland.'') McDonough, who taught Jenkins at the
University of Massachusetts, introduced her to the work of
monologist Spalding Gray and others, encouraging her to try her
hand at autobiographical work. Soon enough, she was projecting
photos of her family on a Theater Works wall, telling stories about
her strip-club-running father and hat-check mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny and mesmerizing,'' McDonough says. ``She already
had her own voice, and she used the slides in her storytelling in
an indelible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy remembers, ``It was so vivid to see this young woman turn
the spotlight on herself. Watching that sort of fearlessness was
one of the first times that made me think, `This is how feminism
can work.'''
</P>
<P>
   After performing that first time, Jenkins acted out a moment so
awkwardly endearing, it could be something out of her movie: ``I
made a beeline for the women's room, so Tim wouldn't find me and
tell me my show (stunk).'' (Actually, he stuck his head through the
bathroom door to congratulate her.)
</P>
<P>
   During those first performances, Jenkins discovered something
surprising: The audience cracked up. Jenkins says, ``Here I was
thinking, `Oh my God, my stories are tragic _ and they're
laughing!' It was from that I started to build a sense of what my
tone was.''
</P>
<P>
   The seriocomic tone of ``Slums'' was itself an issue with the
executives at the Fox Searchlight studio. ``They kept saying it was
a comedy, and I kept saying it was a bleak comedy,'' she recalls.
``It was hard, making them understand that something can be funny
and bleak at the same time. The truth is, this family (in the
movie) is poor, they're homeless, and this is a fractured world
they live in.'' But the movie is still very funny. And, yes, bleak.
Maybe that's what makes it feel like real life.

 &HT;    `Unmarried ... With Child' but no bimbo
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week we've been profiling TV stars who became famous in one
series, and will be coming back this fall in a new series with a
new character. This is our final profile.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who: Christina Applegate
</P>
<P>
   -- Best known as: Kelly Bundy, one of the most memorably dim
blond bimbos in TV history on ``Married ... With Children.'' Tight
of dress, vacant of stare and beloved of adolescent boys (of all
ages) for the show's 11-year run.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next known as: Jesse Warner, a decent, hard-working single
mother on NBC's new sitcom ``Jesse.'' It's from the creators of
``Friends'' and airs between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' at 8:30
p.m. ET, Thursdays starting Sept. 24. Can you say ``guaranteed
hit''?
</P>
<P>
   -- Dramatic stretch: Enormous. There isn't the slightest trace
of Kelly Bundy in Jesse _ or in Applegate either, who's serious and
down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   -- Between shows: Played the Diane Keaton role in ``Mafia!,''
this summer's ``Godfather'' spoof. Also had a small role in ``Mars
Attacks!'' Stars in independent film ``Claudine's Return,'' not yet
released.
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking back: ```Married ... With Children' was closer to a
cartoon than anything else,'' she says. ``A lot of the jokes were
done for shock value. I don't have any resentments toward it
whatsoever. It was a wonderful 11 years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Her image as Kelly Bundy: ``It's never really hit me that the
show is out there, as massive as it is. I've kept very grounded and
very private.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Incidentally: ``I was also raised by a single mother, so I
had firsthand training as far as that's concerned.''

THREE YEARS AFTER OPENING, KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL IS FALLING APART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For U.S. veterans who fought in the Korean War, a
memorial on the Mall in the nation's capital was a long time
coming.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan was in the White House when Congress
authorized construction in 1986. President George Bush broke ground
in 1992, and President Clinton dedicated the memorial in 1995, 42
years after the end of the bloody conflict that killed 36,913
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after only three years, a section of the memorial is
crumbling and the Army Corps of Engineers estimates it will take a
year and $2 million to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this memorial was dedicated in 1995, it was intended to
be a lasting and fitting tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of
our troops who fought in the `forgotten war,''' said Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md. ``Unfortunately, just three years after its
dedication, the monument is not lasting and is no longer fitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial has two main sections. One area known as ``the pool
of remembrance'' now looks like a highway construction site,
complete with trenches, wheelbarrows, sandbags, fluorescent orange
caution cones and piles of gravel. The pool and grove currently are
blocked off by a high wooden fence. Behind the fence, the pool is
dry.
</P>
<P>
   As originally built, the pool section consisted of a large
circular pond about 50 feet across surrounded by a grove of lush
Linden trees embedded in a stone walkway. The pool was intended to
create a zone of contemplation, with the rush of the water blotting
out the sounds of aircraft and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what the designers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   However, faulty irrigation and drainage systems are blamed for
killing the Linden trees, which have been removed, leaving 40
gaping holes. Pavement stones that were fitted around the base of
the trees have been dug up because they settled and became
pedestrian hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has the attention of the National Park Service,
which maintains the memorial, the American Battle Monuments
Commission, which sponsored the memorial's construction, and the
Army Corps of Engineers, the construction managers.
</P>
<P>
   The other section, the ``field of service,'' is an eerie tableau
of 19 life-size stainless steel statues depicting a battle-weary
squad on patrol. The squad has members from all U.S. military
branches. A gaunt GI wearing a rain poncho is bringing up the rear.
He cautions visitors with an outstretched hand at his side in a
``stop'' position, his face contorted as if about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the GIs is a long, black granite wall with more
than 2,400 etched images of U.S. servicemembers. On the other side
is a granite headstone listing the 22 nations that gave support to
South Korea during the 1950-1953 conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Sarbanes complained to the Senate last month that the site's 1.3
million annual visitors have to cope with construction hassles
``instead of experiencing the full effect of the memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the memorial, located just east of the Lincoln
Memorial and south of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, angers
veterans groups that helped raise $13.2 million in private funds to
construct it. About $1 million in tax money was used for the
original project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the deterioration,'' said Phil Budahn,
a spokesman for the American Legion, the largest veterans group
with 2.9 million members. ``There are bugs in any major
construction project, but the bugs here are like cockroaches. They
can't seem to get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems began cropping soon after the memorial opened.
According to the Army Corps of Engineers, the pool sprang leaks and
became clogged with leaves; the lighting system didn't provide
enough illumination at night, causing a pedestrian hazard; and
visitors slipped on smooth walkway stones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these problems have been fixed. The cost: about $1.2
million. But by far the most costly problems are the pool and
grove.
</P>
<P>
   The underground irrigation system that fed the trees never
worked properly, according to William Lecky of Cooper-Lecky
Architects, the firm that designed the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that problem was discovered, the trees had been
deprived of water. After the irrigation system was fixed, the
underground drainage system that took water away from the trees
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the trees didn't get water during very hot periods.
Then they were flooded and the water couldn't be drained away so
they drowned,'' said Lecky. ``As a result, the trees in the grove
around the pool all died.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers estimates that it will cost $2 million to
fix the pool and grove and replace the trees, a tab Sarbanes wants
taxpayers to pick up. The lawmaker sponsored an amendment to next
year's defense appropriations bill directing the Army to find the
money to fix the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Conley, a spokesman for the American Battle Monuments
Commission in Arlington, Va., said that without the money, repairs
might have to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't finish off the project,'' Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers is trying to determine whether faulty
design or construction are to blame for the problems. As a result,
officials are considering whether to file a claim against
Cooper-Lecky or against the construction company. Laurel, Md.-based
R.J. Crowley Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't reached any kind of a decision yet. There hasn't
been any type of claim formed at this point,'' said Doug Garman, a
spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lecky asserted that the design was sound. Crowley executives did
not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Garman said the Corps is hopeful that the
repairs will be complete by next July, in time to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Haupricht, 48, from Toledo, Ohio, who mans a veterans
information stand near the memorial, isn't so sure. ``It takes them
so long to do anything around here,'' Haupricht said. ``If
construction goes on another year, it'll have taken longer than the
Korean War.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARMAGEDDON,'' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler
and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes).
This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a
single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a
strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid)
becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and
a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real
courage. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason
that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries
gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window dressing
at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises,
frequent explosions and bright computer screen colors _ seem as
inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the
illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE AVENGERS,'' starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean
Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100
minutes). Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen
expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The
Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually
had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no
wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers
blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene
depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference
table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and
perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show
where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BLADE,'' starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff. Directed by
Stephen Norrington (R, 120 minutes). Vampires are plotting to take
over the world, and the only person who can save the planet is a
vampiric half-human superhero named Blade. So much fake blood
drips, gushes, explodes and congeals in this hyperkinetic
science-fiction horror film adapted from a popular comic book, that
there's barely a scene that isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is
a low-rent Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous
mixture of black leather and what look like car seat belts. There's
lot of morphing and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff
is the bratty leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are
garish, the acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC,'' starring Olivier Martinez,
Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Romane Bohringer. Directed by Bigas Luna
(not rated; 96 minutes). A delightful, sexy period fable, adapted
from a novel by Didier Decoin. ``Chambermaid'' wittily illustrates
the basic human need to consume and spin heroic stories of passion
and loss (whether or not they're true). When Horty ( Martinez), a
poor French foundry worker, wins a contest that sends him to
Southampton, England, to watch the Titanic depart on its maiden
voyage, he takes to his hotel room a woman who claims to be a
chambermaid on the ship and has no lodging. After the ship sinks,
his co-workers press him about the details, and his fabricated
story of an ultimate one-night stand becomes a local myth that
eventually catapults him into a show business career telling the
same (increasingly embellished) tale over and over. The movie has
profound things to say about gossip, storytelling and the primal
urge to mythicize personal experience (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DANCE WITH ME,'' starring Vanessa L. Williams, Chayanne and
Kris Kristofferson (PG, 126 minutes). A likable mess of a movie,
``Dance With Me'' wants to be the ``Saturday Night Fever'' of salsa
dancing, and in the smoldering-eyed young Puerto Rican star
Chayanne it has found a charismatic Latino answer to John Travolta.
But the story of an ambitious young Cuban who works in a Houston
dance studio run by a man who may or may not be his biological
father ( Kristofferson) meanders so much that the movie never
gathers dramatic momentum, and the dance sequences are hopelessly
choppy and poorly framed. Even a percolating Latin American score
and a winning performance by Ms. Williams as the object of
Chayanne's affection can't hold the pieces together (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,'' starring Drew Barrymore,
Anjelica Huston and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13,
120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella as a
self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother to get
ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and soap
opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky,
resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows
how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince ( Scott) isn't
much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick
Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ``Mona Lisa'' under his
arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from
the standard fairy tale is Ms. Huston's haughty stepmother
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``EVEREST,'' directed by David Brashears with Greg MacGillivray
(not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City doesn't provide
enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a vicarious
near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax Theater
at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go at
``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _ 29,028
feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the eight-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of the team's
climb toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GOVERNESS,'' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840s, and Rosina (Minnie Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic
Jewish woman living in London, poses as a gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GONE WITH THE WIND,'' starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable,
Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by
Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life
left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret
Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never
existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great
film but a satisfying one. The performances by Leigh, Gable and
McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in the meticulous
physical production. The movie shows its age most unfortunately in
the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints, which, though new, go
sort of pinkish more often than they should (Vincent Canby).

<P>
   ``HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK,'' starring Angela Bassett,
Taye Diggs and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.
(R, 99 minutes). This silly soft-core fantasy in which 40-year-old
Stella (Ms. Bassett) meets and falls in love with 20-year-old
Winston ( Diggs) while on vacation in Jamaica is part Caribbean
travel brochure (fly to Jamaica and meet the hunk of your dreams)
and part diluted Chippendales-in-the-Caribbean strip show floated
on a bathtub full of suds with some light comedy thrown in. Ms.
Bassett brings real fire to the role of a beautiful
divorced-with-one-son San Francisco stockbroker whose resistance to
romance is broken down in the tropics. But Diggs' nearly perfect
boyfriend is a vapid romance-novel fabrication. Ms. Goldberg
shamelessly stirs up the suds as Stella's raunchy best friend, who
is secretly dying of liver cancer (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MASK OF ZORRO,'' starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony
Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell
(PG-13, 130 minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling
was serious business, when boyish adventure films still had their
innocence and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a
movie needed in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously
game as the film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play
the aging hero's jokey, hotblooded protege. And he meets his match
in the story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as
``beyond compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should
appeal to older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly
touches (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE NEGOTIATOR,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
Directed by F. Gary Gray (R, 115 minutes). In a twist on the
Hitchcockian maxim, this thriller takes two extraordinary actors
and places them in surprisingly ordinary circumstances. In a film
whose title should have been plural, both stars play seasoned
hostage negotiators who are caught up in a by-the-numbers battle of
wits. Amazingly, both these shrewd, maverick actors are cast as
nice guys, team players and clean-cut family men. The movie's
brisk, familiar look of a police story, heavy with close-ups, that
escalates to a paramilitary operation will look right at home when
it comes to the video screen (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,'' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (
Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously
meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily
ever after? The set-up of this romantic comedy about dating in the
'90s may seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited
film refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's
observations about people and middle-class urban life in general.
Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an idealist
introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and pressures from
all sides, including (in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently
self-centered suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian
bossa-nova score gives the movie exactly the mood of bittersweet
longing (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,'' starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,'' starring Christina Ricci, Martin
Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100
minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully
acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from
nasty little Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil
twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this
film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart
of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally
skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``OUT OF SIGHT,'' starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 120 minutes). As directed with
terrific panache by Soderbergh in his most frankly commercial
effort, Clooney and Ms. Lopez take an intricate Elmore Leonard
crime tale and give it steam heat. Like ``Get Shorty,'' this story
has been adapted from a Leonard novel by Scott Frank, who knows
exactly how to capture the writer's shrewd, hard-boiled style on
screen. An outstanding supporting cast _ including Don Cheadle,
Dennis Farina and Albert Brooks _ provides the movie with a vivid
rogues' gallery and remains good fun even when the story is
occasionally confusing. To fill in the blanks, go back to Leonard's
version; there are certainly worse ways to spend a summer afternoon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PARENT TRAP,'' starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha Richardson
and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written by David
Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A super-cute
remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a privileged
shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride'' team of Ms.
Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam appealingly as
parents who somehow managed to separate their twins at birth
without a twinge of guilt and who seem to have spent all of the
intervening 11 1/2 years shopping. In her dual role as English and
American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house, the other
on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine), the
spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been taking
shrinking-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SNAKE EYES,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise. Directed
by Brian De Palma (R, 99 minutes). An assassination, a fixed
heavyweight boxing bout and a perfectly timed hurricane named
Jezebel collide apocalyptically one night in Atlantic City, where
hellfire rains over a hotel and casino appropriately called the
Millennium. Here is where Rick Santoro ( Cage), the sleazy police
detective in charge of security, discovers that his best friend (
Sinise) could also be his nemesis and he has to make hard moral
choices. This entertaining pop fable, which recalls the director's
``Blow Out,'' isn't believable for a second, but it has a pulpy
energy that keeps on chugging (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,'' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TRUMAN SHOW,'' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WESTERN,'' starring Sergi Lopez and Sacha Bourdo. Directed by
Manuel Poirier (not rated, 121 minutes). What a tenderhearted
delight is ``Western,'' the best-kept secret in town. Don't be put
off by that misleading title: Poirier's road movie is actually set
in western France, where two funny and hapless outsiders wind up
joining forces and embarking on a wonderfully droll journey. The
story begins when a salesman from Spain is outsmarted by a wily
little Russian hitchhiker. It's an introduction that hardly has the
makings of a beautiful friendship. But that's exactly what develops
in a funny, romantic film filled with cozy intimacies and lovely,
wide-screen images of the French countryside. Looking for love,
these two lonely travelers find it in the most sweetly
unpredictable ways. Audiences are liable to fall in love, too
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WRONGFULLY ACCUSED,'' starring Leslie Nielsen, Richard Crenna,
Kelly Le Brock and Sandra Bernhard. Directed by Pat Proft (PG-13,
85 minutes). No one can accuse this film of a shortage of jokes.
Nielsen and his co-stars keep them coming. Unfortunately most of
them just aren't very funny, and ``Wrongfully Accused,'' which is
essentially a parody of ``The Fugitive,'' feels like a tangle of
funny ideas all dressed up with nowhere to go (Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   ``YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,'' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.'' The new movie is so blunt at times, and so
unrelievedly talky and dark at others, that it cries out for the
velvet glove of ``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about
sexual opportunism and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's
material feels mannered or unremittingly sour, it sustains a
psychic ferocity that commands attention. The intricate web of
lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and
it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners
(Maslin).

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: IMAGERY OF SLUMBER AND DANGER BEFORE THE
APOCALYPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the first images you see in ``Modern Times:
Photography Between the Two World Wars'' in the Howard Gilman
Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is Henri
Cartier-Bresson's 1933 picture of a Spanish boy with his back
arched in front of a wall splattered with paint or blood. ``Has
this child been stabbed or is he in the throes of an ecstatic
dance?'' the text on the wall asks. ``Actually he is arching his
back to catch sight of a ball.'' Somehow, knowing the boy's real
situation does not change the atmosphere of danger and ecstasy. The
picture still invites a momentary panic that the boy is about to
drop dead.
</P>
<P>
   A similar feeling pervades Ilse Bing's 1936 photograph of a
jumping horse. The horse is on its hind legs about to leap into
white flames while a few men stand around blithely unaware of the
danger. The photograph was taken at a circus in New York City in
1936. It's benign enough. But isn't it also possible that Bing, a
German photographer, was commenting metaphorically about where
Europe was heading in 1936?
</P>
<P>
   Walking through this exhibition of 50 Surrealist,
Constructivist, Bauhaus and De Stijl photographs from German,
Russian, American, Mexican, English, Italian and Dutch
photographers in the 1920s and 1930s is like stumbling into a
warehouse full of metaphors about the fate of humanity. Although
most of the pictures are straight and unmanipulated (save for a few
of Man Ray's Rayographs and some negative prints by Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy), they are far from straight in effect. Just about
every one appears to contain a barely concealed portent.
</P>
<P>
   There are way too many images of humans leaping and falling (or
about to fall) for this theme to be accidental. Lux Feininger has
two exuberant pictures of dancers titled ``Euyrythmy, or Jump over
the Bauhaus.'' Man Ray's picture of Jacqueline Goddard, printed as
a negative image, catches her with long white hair flying straight
above her head as if she had just jumped into deep water. Alexander
Rodchenko's picture of a student sunbathing on a window ledge in
Moscow is a picture of both leisure and impending suicide. There
is, as the wall text points out, ``dynamism latent even in a body
at rest.'' It might fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the falling pictures in the show, though, the most
impressive is Willi Ruge's 1931 shot called ``The Photographer,''
showing Ruge's own legs and feet dangling over an aerial view of
Berlin during his seven-minute parachute jump.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures in this exhibition suggest that between the wars,
photographers were unusually attracted to liminal states between
ecstasy and danger, leaping and falling, life and death. In
addition to all the leapers and fallers, for example, the show has
far more than its share of sleepers and dolls. Once again, this is
no accident. The Surrealists went looking for them, and when they
did not find them they made do with what they found: dead men,
artists with shut eyes, pigs' legs, sticks on a beach.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1931 photo, Manuel Alvarez Bravo caught a man dozing on a
ledge, one hand under his head and another lodged dreamily in his
crotch. His sleep is the kind that Andre Breton envied: ``I would
like to sleep, in order to surrender myself to the dreamer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deepest sleeper in the show is a dead man. In 1922, when
Marcel Proust died, Jean Cocteau told Man Ray to take some
pictures, and he did. The sheets in the photograph are white and
Proust looks young and tired with his dark hair and dark circles
under his eyes. ``Those who have seen this profile of calm, of
order, of plenitude,'' Cocteau wrote, ``will never forget the
spectacle of an unbelievable recording device come to a stop,
becoming an art object: a masterpiece of repose next to a heap of
notebooks where our friend's genius continues to live on like the
wristwatch of a dead soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   This quotation, pointing out the paradoxical proximity of a dead
body and the live notebooks, suggests that what the Surrealists
liked about sleepers and dreamers was closely related to what they
liked about dolls and mannequins: they all exist on the slender
ledge between consciousness and unconsciousness, between the
animate and the inanimate.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Bellmer made a virtual career out of freaky-looking dolls
with too many arms and legs. One of his works in the show, an
illustration for Paul Eluard's poems ``Les Jeux de la Poupee,'' is
a picture of a headless doll hanging in a closet with a surfeit of
polka-dotted legs pouring out of its torso, terminating in a
cluster of patent-leather shoes. The other, from a tiny book he
made, is a photograph of one of Bellmer's dolls standing in front
of a blueprint for her design and looking petulantly away from the
ghostly image of her designer, Bellmer himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many Surrealist dolls had to bear an awful lot of
symbolic weight. But not all of them. In 1932, Claude Cahun (Lucy
Schwob) took a picture of a doll she traced in the sand on the
beach. The doll has a feathered cap, a spoon for a hand and a bit
of a phallic electrical cord sticking out of its body. It is
clearly in danger of being washed away soon. Dora Maar also made
fun of the craze for human stand-ins. Her ``Portrait of Pere Ubu,''
the fat monster from Alfred Jarry's play ``Ubu Roi,'' is actually a
picture of a baby armadillo taken very close up. You can see the
scaleson his nose, his old lidded eyes and his begging paws.
</P>
<P>
   While the Surrealists were obsessing over their dolls, monsters
and body parts, the Bauhaus and De Stijl photographers were
developing their own fetishes: girders, buildings, bridges and
cities. Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's reverse print of the spiral staircase
and girders of the Transborder Bridge in Marseilles and Ernst
Scheel's gasometer, a picture of the interior of a great white dome
with a fragile ladder leading up to it, are, in one sense, just big
built objects. But their grandeur makes them emblems of a modern
world order, one that seems, at least in retrospect, vertiginous,
even precarious.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally assumed that Constructivist, Bauhaus and De
Stijl artists, who were keen on geometry, rational design and
erector sets, have nothing in common with the Surrealists, who were
keen on sleep, irrationality and dolls. But in this show the border
between them begins to erode.
</P>
<P>
   Has the curator, Pierre Apraxine, somehow managed to find
photographs that break the rules, or has the suggestiveness of
Surrealism, with its metaphorical imagery, infected the more sober
modernist pictures? Whatever the case, here the two approaches seem
uncannily united. And their common ground is the ledge high above
the city.
</P>
<P>
   One photograph by Moholy-Nagy brings this out quite clearly. We
see a building with pure white walls and black squares for windows.
In one of the upper floors, a man is hanging outside the window
stenciling delicate, inconsequential designs around the frame. It's
all very gay until you notice that the man is supported only by a
wooden plank resting on the sill. Is it an ingenious suspension
device or a small diving board?
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Times: Photography between the Two World Wars'' remains
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, New
York, through Oct. 4.

   Tropical storm Bonnie will plod northeastward near the Middle
Atlantic coastline Friday. Its strongest winds, with gusts to
hurricane force, will remain over the open Atlantic to the east of
the storm center. However, gusty winds from the northeast with
speeds to gale force will buffet the immediate shores from
southeast Virginia to southern New Jersey. Rough seas will produce
considerable beach erosion.
</P>
<P>
   As tropical air circulating around the storm is drawn toward the
northwest, it will encounter a stalled front along the Northeast
coast. This will be the lifting mechanism for the sultry air. The
result will be bands of heavy rain that will push northward ahead
of Bonnie's path. The eastern sections of the New York City region
as well as southern New England should notice rain. Flooding is
possible as several inches of rain fall. There will be a distinct
edge to this precipitation shield so that areas just to the west
will see little rain.
</P>
<P>
   The interior Northeast will be sunny and pleasantly warm and the
Southeast will be brighter, but rather hot. A few tropical showers
will drench southern Florida. Hurricane Danielle should strengthen
as it passes well north of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will attend a warm front in the Great Lakes and
western Ohio Valley. A push of drier, very warm air into the Plains
will be accompanied by active breezes and sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   A return flow of humid air into the southern Rockies will
trigger afternoon thunderstorms. The vast majority of the West will
be sunny and hot with record high temperatures in the Great Basin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Stalling Tactic &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, the center of Tropical Storm Bonnie was
located 40 miles south of Elizabeth City, N.C., about 200 to 300
miles short of the more progressive ocean position that computers
had, about 30 hours earlier, predicted. The forecast was based on
the assumption that speedy high-altitude winds from the southwest
would capture the storm and steer it rapidly northeast. But
hurricanes can modify their environment and alter steering winds.
As Hurricane Bonnie moved north, its upper-level circulation of air
offset westerly steering winds, causing the storm to stall.

ART REVIEW: AHAB'S WIFE, IGNORED IN `MOBY-DICK,' TRIES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Near the beginning of ``Moby-Dick,'' Herman
Melville's epic tale of Faustian obsession, the narrator, Ishmael,
learns about the man under whom he's about to embark on a
three-year whaling cruise. It seems that Captain Ahab might be
dangerously depressive, even a little crazy. But, declares
Ishmael's informant, Captain Peleg, it is ``better to sail with a
moody good captain than a laughing bad one.'' To which he adds,
``Besides, my boy, he has a wife _ not three voyages wedded _ a
sweet, resigned girl.''
</P>
<P>
   This single reference to the doomed captain's spouse has
furnished the conceptual basis for ``Ahab's Wife or the Whale,'' a
performance to be presented at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on
Staten Island from Sept. 17 to 20, and for an exhibition of
contemporary art now on view there called just ``Ahab's Wife.'' The
latter is supplemented by prints from Melville's collection and a
presentation of scrimshaw.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderfully suggestive idea. How would Melville's
all-male yarn read from a woman's point of view? Imagine a feminist
sequel to the novel or a Spielberg movie in which Sigourney Weaver
sets out to recover her husband's body, redeem his soul and face
down the monster whale.
</P>
<P>
   How the idea will be realized in the performance, which was
conceived and developed by the sculptor Ellen Driscoll, the poet
Tom Sleigh and the choreographers Amy Spencer and Richard Colton,
remains to be seen. Though variously interesting, the visual art
exhibition falls short of hopes aroused by the title, in part
because only two artists deal directly with Melvillian themes and
only one of those, Ms. Driscoll, explores the idea of Ahab's wife.
Ultimately, it's hard to say who Mrs. Ahab is or what she means.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driscoll's work, which is the core of the show, consists of
three dozen paintings and prints on paper, several sculptures and
some models of props for the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The paper items, all modest in size, are made in a brushy,
neo-Expressionist style that calls to mind the murkier paintings of
Francesco Clemente. Certain symbolic motifs recur _ a female figure
in a hoop skirt, a globe, whale eyes, spirals _ and there's a
portentousness about them that's not inappropriate for Melville's
allegorical grandiosity. But overall, these vague, fragmentary
musings add up to no coherent narrative or symbolic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driscoll's sculptures have rough little plastic figures
isolated from one another in glass vessels, implying some unknown
story of emotional estrangement. Only ``The Eye of the Whale,'' in
which one of these figures crouches over a big glass eye embedded
in an oval steel table, comes close to a capturing the viscerally
cosmic imagery that the novel evokes. Rough models for props, like
a paper hoop skirt bearing a map of the world, shed no more light
on Ahab's wife's character, story or meaning, and one is left
feeling that there's some powerful visual work yet to be made of
this idea.
</P>
<P>
   French sculptor Driss Sans-Arcidet, on the other hand, addresses
the novel (though not Ahab's wife) too literally. He has
constructed a dark corridor of blood-red walls to which he has
attached wooden relief assemblages, one for each of the novel's 135
chapters. The panels are butted edge to edge, creating an
enveloping patchwork environment.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Sans-Arcidet's devotion of two and a half years to
this project, including reading as well as art-making, suggests an
Ahab-like single-mindedness, but the assemblages express little by
way of tragic hubris or madness. They consist of great quantities
of model-scale nautical bric-a-brac _ toy boats, rigging, fishing
gear, sharks' jaws _ glued to panels, Cubist style, and given an
overall antique patina. It produces more the atmosphere of a
seafood restaurant than the spirit of sublime adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing one gallery, Janet Gillespie and Arden Scott produce
works that relate to ``Moby-Dick'' only insofar as they have to do
with boats and the sea. Ms. Gillespie makes finely painted,
smallish surrealistic pictures filled edge to edge with turbulent
seas upon which, in some cases, small empty boats are tossed. In an
earlier work, farm plows sink through the frothy surface into dark
green depths. Ms. Scott fashions sculptures in the form of
abstracted antique boats using twiggy branches, twine-wrapped
steel, paper or copper screening. At best, these works have a
stately formality.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two artists, Sam Christian Holmes of Baltimore and
Arnold Schalks of the Netherlands, are each working on public
artworks that are unfinished. Holmes will build a gate
incorporating imagery suggested by discussions with residents of
the Richmond Terrace Apartments, a public housing project. An
exhibition of materials, photographs, drawings and text arising
from this effort is on view. Schalks, in collaboration with New
York artist Ron Rocco, is constructing a computer-equipped kiosk
near the ferry terminals that will be open from Tuesday until Sept.
14.
</P>
<P>
   The prints from Melville's collection include small, finely
engraved copies of drawings of disasters at sea by an English
academician named C. Stanfield and a set of engravings of paintings
by J.M.W. Turner. Though modestly scaled, these images vividly
express an experience of the ocean that most late-20th-century
people can only dimly imagine.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Snug Harbor, which is worth a trip no matter what's
on view, don't miss the exhibitions of scrimshaw and prints. Some
of the objects intricately carved from whalebone by unknown sailors
_ a magical box ornamented by two upright miniature columns ending
in fists holding snakes, for example _ have as much formal and
imaginative ingenuity as anything contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahab's Wife'' remains at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000
Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, New York City, through Oct. 4.
Open on Wednesdays through Sundays noon to 5 p.m. Information about
the performances, scheduled Sept. 17- 20: (718) 448-8534.

 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Honestly, the idea of chasing actors across
Washington Square Park as they performed Chekhov was not all that
appealing. That's the sort of thing the Gorilla Repertory Theater
Company does. The actors perform a play in some outdoor setting,
but when the scene shifts, nobody puts a new set in place; instead,
the actors just move to a different area of the park, courtyard or
whatever. The audience follows.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as a great relief to learn that the Gorilla Rep's new
production of ``The Cherry Orchard'' required only one migration by
audience and cast, to the orchard itself for Act II. Acts I, III
and IV take place in the Ranevsky family's parlor _ represented
here by Oriental rugs, one chair, a tea cart, a bookcase and an
empty gilt frame nailed to a tree. The audience sits on the ground,
on fairly comfortable skateboard hills.
</P>
<P>
   The next surprise comes in Act I when a Ranevsky daughter
announces, ``Mama's still not playing with a full deck.'' The
script also includes the lines ``Get over it,'' ``Okey-dokey,''
``Close, but no cigar'' and ``You got a problem with that?''
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely the Cliff's Notes version of ``The Cherry
Orchard,'' and I mean that in a nice way. Longtime devotees of
Chekhov who have seen the most experienced theatrical companies in
the world perform his work and who revisit his plays to reflect on
the universality of his meaning should not attend. Reducing ``The
Cherry Orchard'' (the playwright's last work, written in 1904) to
under 90 minutes would surely seem like sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   But to newer devotees, who haven't seen all the plays a dozen
times, Leah Ryan's new adaptation, as well as the skilled cast's
collective performance, can be an eye-opener. She has distilled the
story, emphasizing the humor and discarding most of the tragedy.
The latter seems like a mistake, but Chekhov, we're told, always
insisted that ``The Cherry Orchard'' was a comedy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Making the play relevant to our times isn't much of a stretch.
The story is that of a formerly wealthy family on the verge of
bankruptcy. The only solution, it seems, is to sell their cherry
orchard. A nouveau riche neighbor, out of the kindness of his
heart, suggests an alternative: subdivide the orchard, build summer
cottages there and rent them out. But the Ranevskys won't hear of
it. The orchard represents the genteel past to them, and besides,
as Mama comments, ``I hate tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   So they do nothing. As a result, the estate is sold out from
under them (to Lopahin, their newly rich friend), everybody is
displaced, the servants don't know what to do, and the orchard is
destroyed. At one point, in Act II, Trofimov sums it all up: ``We
do nothing but drink vodka and theorize and complain about how
depressed we are.'' Yeah. Don't you love Russian theater?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cherry Orchard'' continues on Friday and Sunday nights at
the southwest corner of Washington Square Park through Sept. 27.
Admission is free.

DOES CHERNOMYRDIN'S POLITICAL STRATEGY MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-BANKS, RUSSIA-EUROPE, RUSSIA-U.S.,

(bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his drive to consolidate his power, Viktor
Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the fall of
the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between the
remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from the
ashes of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has sent unmistakable signals that he wants to form
a coalition government that embraces tycoons and Communists alike.
But the final outcome of that effort to reconcile such opposing
forces is by no means clear, and the politics of Chernomyrdin's
coalition-building is at odds with the economic crisis in which
Russia finds itself.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, how can Chernomyrdin be all things to all men and
still make the tough decisions that will enable Russia to extract
itself from the rapidly escalating economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most difficult questions for him,''
observed Boris Nemtsov, the reform-minded former Kremlin aide who
resigned this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One the one hand he has to organize a strong and professional
government to avoid big failures and big mistakes,'' Nemtsov added.
``On the other hand, he has to compromise with the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing the short-term political logic behind
Chernomyrdin's hints about a coalition government _ or as he puts
it a ``government of accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's appointment as prime minister needs the approval
of the Communist-dominated Parliament. To establish himself as a
figure of national reconciliation _ and advance his longer-term
presidential ambitions _ Chernomyrdin would like to be approved
overwhelming by Parliament and on the first vote.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that he is ready to trade government posts for
parliamentary votes. President Boris Yeltsin has given Chernomyrdin
enormous latitude in forming his government. As the newspaper
Izvestia put in a headline early this week, ``Yeltsin Yields
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a matter of jobs or confirmation votes. The
Communist opposition has made it plain that they are also looking
for more left-leaning economic policies. As Gennady Seleznyov, a
Communist who is the speaker of Parliament, put it, ``if
Chernomyrdin recognizes our anti-crisis program and decides to
implement it, his appointment will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Chernomyrdin's allies have
flirted with the idea of coalition rule. During the 1996
presidential election, some of Yeltsin's leading financial bankers
became so fearful that the Communists might win that they issued an
open letter calling for an accommodation between the Yeltsin and
Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who helped mastermind
Chernomyrdin's return to power, was among the group.
</P>
<P>
   But extricating Russia from its current crisis _ or at least
limiting the damage _ will also require decisions that irritate the
Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, Russia must control the money supply to
fight inflation, husband the government's dwindling resources by
limiting subsidies to failing banks, and reassure foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chernomyrdin has straddled the fence. He has talked
about continuing the march toward a free market. But he has also
echoed some of the Communist's favorite slogans.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for instance, that he would change ``industrial policy,
because by purely monetarist measures, we will not pull Russia out
of the crisis.'' That was a sop toward the Communist demands that
the Kremlin print more money and use government credits to prop up
ailing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Chernomyrdin was trying to stroke the Communists, he
rushed off to the Crimea for a meeting with Michel Camdessus, the
managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has
given Russia a small part of the $17 billion rescue bailout that
was negotiated in July, and Chernomyrdin wants to make sure that
the money keeps flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was not accompanied by a Communist deputy. He was
joined by Boris Fyodorov, the blunt-spoken economic aide who also
serves as the nation's chief tax collector. Fyodorov is a staunch
advocate of the free market and has told associates that if he were
a U.S. citizen, he would be a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor average Russians will know exactly where
Chernomyrdin stands until he makes begin to make tough decisions on
collecting taxes, cutting the budget deficit and saving the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the appointments to the Chernomyrdin team will
give some indication where he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to take advantage of Chernomyrdin's willingness to
compromise, the Communists have demanded at least 10 of the top
posts, including those involved in overseeing finance and industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the industrial barons who backed Chernomyrdin have their eye
on these jobs as well. Pyotr Aven, the head of Alpha Bank, is said
to be interested in running the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   And this equation does not take into account Chernomyrdin's own
party, Our Home is Russia, which believes that it should dominate
the upper rungs of power and is the second biggest party in
Parliament after the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a cadre of experienced government aides like
Fyodorov. Some of them are close to Chernomyrdin, who has stressed
the value of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sergei Kiriyenko was dismissed as prime minister this
week, the Yeltsin government was on a collision course with the
Communists in Parliament. Forming an alliance might seem a safer
course to Chernomyrdin, but coalition politics also has its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up Russia's addled political scene, Izvestia noted that
Chernomyrdin's attempts to negotiate were encouraging some members
of the leftist opposition to harden their demands. ``The game
between the leftist opposition with the prime minister has become
dangerous for the country,'' it said.

TEXANS' FEAR OF CRIME DROPPING, POLL INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans are far less afraid of crime in general
than they were 20 years ago, a trend that would seem to pattern the
drop in the crime rate, according to a new study by Sam Houston
State University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, more than half of those surveyed were afraid to walk
alone at night in their neighborhoods, but today only 1 in 3 Texans
express that fear, according to the survey conducted by the
Huntsville university's Criminal Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, nearly half of those queried in 1978 feared being
alone in their homes at night, compared with slightly more than 1
in 5 harboring such concerns today.
</P>
<P>
   There was little difference among blacks and whites on this
issue. The percentage of those who said they were afraid to walk
alone at night within one mile of their homes dropped by roughly 20
percentage points for both groups; among Hispanics the percentage
of those who said they were afraid dropped 13 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Texans still have unrealistic fears of becoming victims of
violent crime. And the media's intense focus on crime, particularly
violent crime, feeds those fears by creating the perception of far
more crime than actually is occurring, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Although those surveyed indicated they mostly feel safe in their
homes and neighborhoods, their fears emerged when they were asked
about concerns regarding specific crimes, such as rape, assault and
burglary. Fifty-nine percent said they think they will become crime
victims in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was nearly the same as in 1978, when 57 percent of
respondents expressed such fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you go about measuring the level of concern
people have about crime, there does not seem to be a significant
change in people's concerns today compared with 20 years ago,''
said Dennis Longmire, a professor of criminal justice who headed
the study. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, director of the governor's Criminal Justice Policy
Council, said the survey findings that Texans are less fearful in
their neighborhoods today is ``remarkable'' given the intense media
focus on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's showing that people are more sophisticated in
distinguishing between immediate fears and that caused by media
focus'' on crime coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans surveyed were certainly mindful of the media. Like
Americans everywhere, residents of this state pin more blame on
violence in the media _ from movies to local television newscasts _
for causing crime rates to increase. From 1978 to 1998, the
percentage of those who thought movie violence contributed to crime
nearly doubled _ from 25 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed a specific shift in fear of assault, with
nearly twice as many Texans today fearing they might be beaten or
attacked with a weapon as there were in 1978. Twelve percent of
those surveyed said they fear being beat up during a crime in the
next year and 14 percent said they fear becoming the victim of a
criminal with a knife or other weapon. That compares with 7 and 8
percent, respectively, of those surveyed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   While those expressing fear of violent crimes do not represent a
huge number of Texans, Longmire said, the findings are
``significantly higher'' than the '78 figures and are completely
out of proportion with the actual likelihood of falling victim to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular image of crime (in the media) focuses on personal
violent crime, whereas the empirical reality is that most people _
if they are going to be the victim of a crime _ most people are
going to be the victim of a property crime as opposed to a personal
violent crime,'' Longmire said.
</P>
<P>
   But both violent crime and property crime rates are down
statewide. In Houston the overall crime rate cropped 3.3 percent
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the fear of becoming the victim of a
burglary has decreased 10 percentage points over the past two
decades, to 24 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very infrequently, or very rarely, do the news media
talk about burglary or theft kinds of crimes,'' he added. ``What
you see in the newspapers, what you see on television, what you
watch in dramatic representations of crime are people getting shot,
people getting assaulted, stabbed, kicked and beaten severely,
people being robbed as opposed to burglarized.''

FEEL THE CITY'S PULSE? IT'S BE-BOP, MAN! 
</HEADLINE>

books, CDs and videos about be-bop is at the end of the article.)

the 1920s,'' teaches at Columbia University. She is working on a

 By ANN DOUGLAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1964, Thelonious Monk, one of the pioneers of
be-bop and perhaps jazz's greatest composer, was asked by an
interviewer to define jazz. Though Monk disliked questions and
usually ignored them, this time he didn't miss a beat: ``New York,
man. You can feel it. It's around in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl (Bud) Powell, another of be-bop's originators, fragile but
divinely gifted, had a habit of standing, oblivious to passers-by,
on a street corner, pad in hand, writing down what he was hearing,
mixing insides and outsides into startlingly fresh combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Change often registers as sound before it is fully assimilated
as culture. Be-bop was the electrifying first-time translation of
post-Depression America into musical language, and its creators
found in New York their capital. The only place he would be willing
to live if he couldn't live in New York, Monk said, was the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Monk and Powell both grew up in Manhattan, Monk in the San Juan
Hill neighborhood in the West 60s and Powell in Harlem. They were
``already in Xanadu,'' as Monk's biographer Laurent de Wilde puts
it. But be-bop's two other founding fathers, Charlie (Bird) Parker
and John Birks (Dizzy) Gillespie, were from Kansas City, Mo., and
small-town North Carolina, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Gillespie, then 19, brash and teeming with
intelligence, came to New York. Though the job he had been promised
fell through, he stayed on, living on 25 cents a day, because, in
his words, New York had ``a different caliber of musicianship than
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker hoboed his way to the city in 1939 at 18, arriving in
raggedy disarray with nothing to his name but audacity and several
years of fiendishly intensive, innovative practice on his
instrument. Working as a dishwasher at Jimmy's Chicken Shack in
Harlem, he heard Art Tatum, a master of jazz piano at its most
demanding. After a trip back South, Parker reappeared in January
1942 at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, playing alto saxophone with
the Jay McShann Orchestra, a Kansas City band. Parker's
performance, faster than flight, shattered preconceptions with
every note.
</P>
<P>
   Between sets, Parker hung out on the corner of 140th Street and
Lenox Avenue, looking at the Savoy's big sign and taking in the
sights and sounds of the streets. He liked shifting the scenery,
scrambling his associations; better ideas come that way, he said.
When McShann's band left town, Parker stayed behind, ``just digging
New York,'' in McShann's words, to pursue what Parker called ``that
real advanced New York style.''
</P>
<P>
   Be-bop (bop for short) was sometimes labeled ``New York Jazz,''
and it is, in fact, the only major school of jazz to which the city
can lay proprietary claim. Jazz of the '20s, dominated by Louis
Armstrong, originated in New Orleans, migrating to New York only
after a formative detour in Chicago. Armstrong inspired '30s swing,
the music of the big bands led by Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn
Miller, Count Basie and Duke Ellington, the ``mother bands,'' as
Gillespie called them, whose music the be-boppers both emulated and
revolutionized.
</P>
<P>
   New York's jazz sound had always depended on the piano, as
Chicago's had on the horn, and bop was piano-based. Powell and Monk
were pianists; though his instrument was the trumpet, Gillespie
worked out his (and Parker's) innovations on the piano, then wrote
them down.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie integrated Latin and African music into his ``Cu-bop''
sound. Powell had mastered Debussy, Chopin and Bach by his teens,
and Parker listened avidly to Bartok, Stravinsky and Hindemith.
Monk's trademark hats, ranging from black Chinatown caps to
Scandinavian fur crowns and Charles Lindbergh-style pilot gear,
were a parade of multicultural insignia. Bop's wide-ranging
allusiveness, its quicksilver expressivity, angular dissonance and
shockingly extended palette of pitches and rhythms echoed the
international mix, the fluidity and speed of New York life.
</P>
<P>
   Bop began at roughly the same time as World War II, in 1940 when
Monk, then 23, was hired to play with Kenny (Klook) Clarke, the man
who transformed jazz drumming, at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem.
Gillespie jammed with them after his regular engagement, and Parker
joined them a year later. When Minton's closed for the night, they
adjourned to Clark Monroe's Uptown House, an after-hours club where
an extraordinary teen-age drummer named Max Roach played in the
band.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's entrance into the war in late 1941 imposed gas
rationing, entertainment taxes and curfews, sharply restricting
travel. The swing bands were touring bands, and some of them
continued to tour, but now everyone was looking for a long-term
base in a big city, easily accessible by public transit.
</P>
<P>
   What hurt swing helped be-bop. The expense and risks of touring
(especially down South) had been far greater for black musicians
than for white. The cramped quarters of many city clubs suited the
young bop musicians, eager to work with the small ensembles that
maximized opportunities for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the musicians' strike of 1942, which banned recording, had
its advantages. Errors were taboo in a big band or a recording
studio, where mainstream taste set the standard. But Monk urged
musicians: ``Make a mistake. Play what you want and let the public
pick up'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   Swing was first and foremost dance music. Bop, however, though
it tracked the body's rhythms with new exactness and daring,
militantly demanded of its audience acute listening rather than
motion. Like their great predecessors Lester Young, Coleman
Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, James Johnson and Art Tatum, the be-boppers
played and reworked Tin Pan Alley's classic songs. But as angry
critics noted, you couldn't always recognize the original in its
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Preternaturally quick-witted, Parker liked to refer to Jerome
Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's ``All the Things You Are'' as
``Yatag,'' an allusion to Parker's favorite line in the song, ``You
are the angel's glow.'' As ``Yatag'' makes the part stand for the
whole, skimming off the first letters of the words and abstracting
the words into a new sound, bop pulled apart and rearranged chords
and melodic motifs from older songs, exteriorizing the tunes'
harmonies and opening everything to extended improvisation, bop's
raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   The titles of swing standards like ``Star Dust,'' ``Honeysuckle
Rose'' and ``What Is This Thing Called Love?,'' though evocative,
needed no translation, but what was one to make of Monk and Kenny
Clarke's ``Epistrophy'' or Parker's ``Klactoveedsedsteen''?
(Parker's anxious producer consulted a dictionary and a
psychiatrist before a Parker initiate told him, ``Man, it's just a
sound.'')
</P>
<P>
   The word ``be-bop,'' which both Monk and Gillespie claimed to
have coined, described the music's unconventional stop-and-start
form, especially Gillespie and Parker's witty eighth-note pair
conclusions. The purpose of bop's irregular phrasings, side-sliding
harmonies and whirlwind pace, was, in Kenny Clarke's words, to
``raise the standards of musicianship,'' to tell people, ``Whatever
you go into, go into it intelligently.'' The be-boppers were the
real New York intellectuals, the hippest, smartest men in town.

KENYAN HOSPITAL WORKERS PLAYED KEY ROLE IN EMBASSY BOMBING ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although FBI Director Louis J. Freeh on Thursday
praised U.S. investigators for bringing a suspect in the Nairobi
embassy bombings to New York, court documents show that the big
break in the case may have come from alert Kenyan hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, the suspect, Mohamed Rashed Daoud
Al-`Owhali, and another unnamed suspect drove a vehicle loaded with
homemade bombs to the U.S. embassy in Nairobi on the morning of
Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle exploded, demolishing an adjacent secretarial
college and sending debris ripping through one of the Kenyan
capital's most congested streets. The blast killed 247 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Another 10 people died in a nearly simultaneous explosion at the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In his confession to authorities, Al-`Owhali, also known as
Khalid Salim, said the bombing was intended to be a suicide mission
and that he expected to die in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-`Owhali survived, receiving only cuts and abrasions on
his face and hands and a large wound on his back from the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Following the blast, he was taken to a local hospital where he
was treated with other victims and later released.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the hospital, Al-`Owhali allegedly discarded in a
bathroom two keys that fit the padlock on the rear of the bombing
vehicle and three bullets for a gun he had left behind in the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital employees discovered the keys and bullets and alerted
Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Kenyan officials confronted Al-`Owhali and took
him into custody. On Aug. 12, he was turned over to the FBI. After
eight days of questioning, Al-`Owhali confessed to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In his confession, Al-`Owhali said he was trained in terrorist
camps in Afghanistan, including several camps affiliated with al
Qaeda, an international terrorist group led by Usama bin Laden.
Al-`Owhali, whose nationality is unknown, also admitted to
attending conferences and meeting with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials suspect bin Laden may have financed and planned
the two embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh praised the Kenyan authorities for their ``extraordinary
cooperation, assistance and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. authorities brought Al-`Owhali to New York
City where a U.S. magistrate will decide which U.S. court should
try him.
</P>
<P>
   A New York grand jury and the FBI field office there had been
investigating bin Laden's role in at least three terrorist attacks
or plots, officials said, including the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing, an aborted plot in New York to bomb bridges and tunnels
and a November 1995 car bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that
killed five Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint filed against Al-`Owhali, the bombing suspect
is charged with 12 counts of murder, one count of murder conspiracy
and one count of using weapons of mass destruction. If convicted on
all charges, Al-`Owhali would face a sentence of life in prison
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney general in charge of New York City, Mary Jo
White, said the charges ``show this nation's commitment to track
down and prosecute all those who commit heinous, cowardly acts of
international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   A second bombing suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly
en route to New York. Odeh had been held by Kenyan authorities
since Aug. 14, a week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the
day of the bombing. Odeh is said to be either a Jordanian or
Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said other suspects are being investigated and also could
be sent here for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the embassy bombings, the United States last
week staged cruise missile strikes against targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan it said were linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try Al-`Owhali, and perhaps others, in this
country represented a swift resolution of a potential diplomatic
problem of whether Kenya or the United States would handle the
first prosecutions from the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the
hundreds of Kenyan victims but also wary that a trial there for an
attack on a U.S. target might invite new terrorist assaults on
Kenyan targets.

 NEW YORK: in town.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1941, white fans began to flock to Minton's. A few years
later, popular demand brought bop downtown, to the small, crowded
clubs on 52nd Street, known as ``Swing Street,'' or just ``the
Street,'' then thronged with servicemen, taking business from black
entrepreneurs but gaining wider exposure for the music. In 1943 and
1944, Gillespie and Parker went on tour with the Earl Hines and
Billy Eckstine bands.
</P>
<P>
   Bop's uptown, inner-city origins, however, determined its
nature. The city it dramatized was not the Big Town as
traditionally seen by the provincial eager to learn cosmopolitan
ways but, in Leslie Fiedler's words, ``the only home of the
essentially homeless,'' the refuge of the outsider, the fugitive
and the rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Although swing musicians joined the armed forces in droves, and
Glenn Miller's band became the Army Air Force Band, bop musicians
were skeptical of donating their services to a nation that defended
abroad liberties it abrogated at home. There were nearly 100 race
riots in 1943, including one in Harlem. Dizzy Gillespie put his
draft board on notice that he might not be able to distinguish a
white German soldier from a white U.S. one; like Monk, he was
promptly classified 4-F.
</P>
<P>
   Be-bop, the invention of the musicians who stayed in New York
instead of going to war, in Langston Hughes' words, ``let midnight
out on bail.''
</P>
<P>
   The four major pioneers of be-bop were temperamentally very
different, though the two New Yorkers, Powell and Monk, tended to
stick together, while Gillespie, bop's organizer and statesman,
found in Parker ``the other side of my heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Irrepressibly high-spirited, practical, and a master of public
relations, Gillespie introduced dark glasses, berets and hip black
English to the mainstream. Asked if his goatee was an affectation,
he replied, ``No, man, it's a fetish.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Cab Calloway at the Cotton Club in 1939, ``Diz the
Wiz'' mugged and threw spitballs on the bandstand while up front
Calloway, dressed to kill in a trademark white zoot suit, tried to
put over a sentimental love song. In 1963, on a short-lived run for
the presidency (he decided that the office was ``below my
station''), Gillespie promised to rename the White House the
``Blues House.''
</P>
<P>
   Short, with irregular features and cheeks that ballooned as he
played, decidedly unglamorous, Gillespie looked like the sidekick,
the comic foil to the leading man in the movies. In fact, he was
the only grown-up in bop's inner circle, the only one who was not a
drug addict or an alcoholic or a psychiatric patient.
</P>
<P>
   Until his death in 1993, frolicking at speeds previously
unimaginable in upper octave reaches the jazz trumpet had hitherto
only sighted, Gillespie was a jazz warrior. His music inscribed a
new hieroglyphics of energy, turning adrenaline into avant-garde
art and the sheerest, hardiest form of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Parker spent his short life serving two exacting masters, his
heroin habit and his music. In the mid-'40s, carelessly dressed in
rumpled, gangster-style pin-striped suits, gorgeous to look at,
full of mischief and unspeakably charismatic, he was New York's
lord of misrule, brooking no interference. ``Wait, Baby,'' he would
say to his favorite cabby, as he jumped out to score drugs,
disappearing for hours. ``Don't move.''
</P>
<P>
   When a white proprietor reproved Parker's musicians for using
the same entrance as the club's white patrons, Parker smashed the
glasses from which the band had been drinking, explaining to the
indignant owner that they were without value since black lips had
touched them. In Paris, a fan presented him with a rose; he
promptly ate the petals, then put the stem in his lapel. A genius
on several fronts, he quoted Baudelaire and the Rubyaiyat (``The
bird is on the wing,'' a favorite line, was one of several possible
sources for his nickname) and wept when a friend read the Koran
aloud to him in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   No one could depend on Bird. In his autobiography, Miles Davis,
who played trumpet for Parker's group in the mid-'40s, tells of one
date at the Three Deuces, a 52nd Street club. Parker missed the
rehearsal he himself had called, appearing just as the gig began,
then picked up his horn and played every tune in precisely the key
the band had rehearsed. ``Did you ever doubt this?'' his look said,
as he took off on a Pied Piper flight of brilliant invention.
</P>
<P>
   Parker was a magician, a con man of gargantuan appetites, to
whom everything came with uncanny ease: music, women and, finally,
ruin. He died at 34 in New York on March 12, 1955, of cirrhosis and
complications. The attending doctor, who didn't know him, estimated
his age as somewhere between 50 and 60.
</P>
<P>
   If Parker was the renegade prince destined never to reach the
throne, Monk seemed to have been born already in possession of his
kingdom, centuries into his rule. His given name, Thelonious Sphere
Monk, was not a name but a title. Miles Davis rightly described bop
as ``an all-black thing,'' but talent was always more important
than race. The incompetent were ruthlessly eliminated, and Monk,
dark-skinned, 6 feet 2 inches and weighing upward of 200 pounds,
was often the one to do it. Incapable of lying or being merely
polite, he would tell some unlucky musician who tried to sit in
with him at Minton's: ``That's not the way we play. We changed all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Legendary for his protracted silences and oblique utterances,
Monk thought in cryptograms. ``Monk,'' he pointed out, was simply
``know'' spelled backward, with the ``w'' on its back. ``It's
always night, or we wouldn't need light,'' he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar density of his person was that of some rare form of
matter, forged in fires unknown, that accrues more energy and mass
than it can ever transmit. On several occasions, Monk was beaten by
the police or arrested for simply being somewhere, a hotel lobby or
an airport, with no visible purpose. Racism was very much a factor,
yet as his manager, Harry Colomby, put it, against an authority as
resolutely unnegotiated as Monk's, ``people defended themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Monk's first and most devoted subjects were women, first his
mother; then his wife, Nellie, and finally his friend, the wealthy,
glamorous and eccentric Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, known
as Nica to her friends. Nica painted a little, using a mixture of
acrylic, milk, scotch and perfume, and became a passionate,
dedicated patron of the new jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie, who supported him until his career took off in the late
'50s, can be seen in documentaries of Monk on tour in the '60s,
putting on his jacket or counting receipts while he munches an
apple. During the long, possibly drug-induced, depressive illness
that blanketed in silence the six years before his death in 1982,
he moved to Nica's house in Weehawken, N.J. Nellie came from
Manhattan almost every day to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the big swing bands, bop seldom featured female
vocalists. Bop was an all-male gang. Women served; they didn't
play. Monk wanted dependability, not sex. When a pale and beautiful
blond woman tried to approach him at a club, he looked at her and
asked, ``How do I know you're not a ghost?''
</P>
<P>
   His compositions were magisterial jazz balladry, a haunting
series of shifts among reiterated pressure points, articulated with
the utmost precision, sculpted in stone. Yet his speech was often
incomprehensible. He visibly refused to do the physical work of
shaping and enunciating words. It didn't interest him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Monk came to represent the same incorruptibility
and unassimilable African-ness that he admired in the singer Paul
Robeson. During the race riots of the late '60s, Monk's face
appeared on a mural in Chicago, next to those of Malcolm X and
Patrice Lumumba.

NEW YORK: PATRICE LUMUMBA. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   A musical prodigy who was playing with professional musicians
before he was 10, the young Earl (Bud) Powell sported a ``conk''
hairstyle, dressed impeccably in stiff-collared white shirts and
black suits, and announced, ``I am the Earl of Harlem!'' Yet by all
accounts, even then he was gentle, almost naive, his large eyes
either veiled or too unguarded.
</P>
<P>
   His instrument claimed, and devoured, his vast authority. During
performances, as the room filled with demonically swift chromatic
runs, large, implacably rich chords and heartbreaking melodies,
there seemed to be no separation between player and piano. He
didn't rest well, he later told a doctor, because ``I never stop
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   What chance Powell had for a life outside his music ended in
Philadelphia in early 1945 when he tried to intercede with some
white policemen who were harassing his friend Monk. The officers
beat him about the head so severely that the scars were visible
until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He began drinking too much and using drugs. In 1947, at 22, he
entered his first mental hospital, where he was subjected to
experimental anti-psychotic medications and electroshock treatments
that dazed and terrified him.
</P>
<P>
   He told his story in the titles he gave his most characteristic
compositions, ``Dance of the Infidels,'' ``Un Poco Loco,'' ``Tempus
Fugue-it,'' ``I'm Sorry, Please'' and ``Glass Enclosure.'' His
extraordinary mind was intact, but difficult to access. In 1953, he
was declared incompetent to manage his own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was bop's baby in the bullrushes, its sacred child,
helpless and wise with all the knowledge for which birth usually
serves as censor. Asking for affection from those he loved with
direct fervor, he is the only person with whom Monk is known to
have held hands in public. In happy moods, he ate and laughed with
gusto, but his instinct for the fault lines of human brutality and
deprivation was flawless. Talking to a Japanese pianist he had just
met, he wanted to know if it bothered her that her husband was an
American. When she said no, he asked, ``But what about Hiroshima?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ill-fated,'' he wrote in a poem found on his bedside table
right after his death on July 31, 1966, yet his music possessed
healing properties for the tortures it ecstatically explicated.
Visiting him in the hospital in the late '40s, a friend discovered
that he had drawn a keyboard on the wall by his bed. As his fingers
ran over the keys, Powell asked, ``How do you think it sounds?''
</P>
<P>
   Together these men created a new musical language, giving New
York a dazzling portrait of itself in sound. In a '70s interview,
Gillespie said that be-bop was ``a love music.'' Bop is
mind-dancing; it's about seduction, about hearing notes that are
intimated rather than played, ghostly air-sketching in dialogue
with sonic bravado, an impossible mix of intellect and rapture.
</P>
<P>
   Bop catches you as you are, not yesterday or tomorrow, but
today, this moment, in all its unfathomable complexity, bringing
you the world before it is coined into convention, while it is
still gold. Running down a city street in the early '40s, Parker
turned and called back to his friends, ``You can do anything you
want to!''
</P>
<P>
   Pick up your Walkman, the listener's instrument. Put on a be-bop
tape, and walk around 125th Street or what's left of the old Times
Square or Avenue B. If you're a New Yorker, you're a bop musician,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a selection of sites that are associated with the be-bop
musicians in New York:
</P>
<P>
   1. Savoy Ballroom, Lenox Avenue and 140th Street, Harlem.
Charlie Parker played in this legendary jazz and dance hall with
the Jay McShann Orchestra in his early days in New York, in January
1942, astounding listeners, including Dizzy Gillespie who
recognized him at once as ``my colleague.'' Bud Powell played here
with the Cootie Williams band in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   2. Monroe's Uptown House, 198 W. 134th St., Harlem. With
Minton's, be-bop's birthplace. An after-hours club run by the
ex-hoofer Clark Monroe (his brother Jimmy married Billie Holiday),
where in 1943-44 Gillespie and Parker perfected the be-bop sound
after finishing their regular gigs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   3. St. Nicholas and 140th Street (exact address unknown),
Harlem. Powell was born here on Sept. 27, 1924, in an apartment
building on the corner; his father, William, was the building's
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   4. Minton's Playhouse, 210 W. 118th St., Morningside Heights.
Club run by Harry Minton, who provided superb free soul food for
musicians on Monday nights in exchange for free music. Charlie
Christian, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk, Parker and Gillespie made
musical history here in the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   5. Hotel Stanhope, 995 Fifth Ave., at 81st Street, Manhattan
(also its current site). Parker died here in Baroness Pannonica de
Koenigswarter's luxury suite on March 12, 1955, while watching the
Tommy Dorsey band on television. Monk visited here often in the
late 1950s (despite complaints about his late-night piano playing).
</P>
<P>
   6. Hotel Bolivar, Central Park West and 83rd Street. The
Baroness moved here in the late 1950s; Monk composed ``Blues
Bolivar Ba-lues'' in her honor, then moved with her to her new home
in Weehawken, N.J., facing the New York skyline, where he remained
until his death.
</P>
<P>
   7. St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue,
Manhattan (also its current site). Monk's funeral took place here
on Feb. 22, 1982, with musicians playing for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   8. 243 West 63rd Street (now Lincoln Center). Monk grew up here
in the old San Juan Hill black district, then largely populated by
West Indians. He moved to Lincoln Towers on West End Avenue in
1967, but kept the lease on his original home until his death in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   9. 52nd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, known as ``The
Street.'' A magical block of jazz clubs (since razed for office
buildings), including the Onyx, Spotlite, Three Deuces and Kelly's
Stable. Gillespie, Parker, Powell and Miles Davis played here in
the mid-1940s. The new jazz had hit white Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   10. Birdland, 1678 Broadway, at 53rd Street, Manhattan. The most
successful of the new jazz palaces, intended to succeed The Street.
It opened on Dec. 15, 1949, with dozens of (caged) birds on view
and Charlie (Bird) Parker presiding. Powell, Monk, Gillespie and
other bop pioneers played here over the years as well. (The current
club known as Birdland is at 315 W. 44th St. in Manhattan.)
</P>
<P>
   11. Town Hall, 123 West 43rd St., Manhattan (still open). Monk
held a large band concert here in 1959 to universal acclaim. Powell
gave his last performance here in 1965; he was led out onstage, and
played like a doom-struck ghost.
</P>
<P>
   12. 216 West 19th Street. Eager to become ``a New York
musician,'' Gillespie lived here with his brother, James Penfield,
when he first came to town from Philadelphia in 1937, eating for 25
cents a day.
</P>
<P>
   13. The Five Spot, Cooper Square. Monk gained real recognition
playing here in 1957; he was accompanied by the explosive young
tenor saxophonist John Coltrane. The New Yorker described its
ambiance as ``Greenwich Village of `The Iceman Cometh' period and
decor.''
</P>
<P>
   14. The Jazz Gallery, 80 St. Marks Place. Another showcase for
Monk's genius, beginning in 1960. Between sets, he walked the
streets, playing with the traffic like a ``matador,'' remarked his
saxophonist Steve Lacy.
</P>
<P>
   15. 151 Ave. B, near 10th Street. Parker moved here with his
fourth and last wife, Chan, in 1950, bringing the black avant-garde
to downtown white bohemia.
</P>
<P>
   16. Blue Note Club, 131 W. Third St. (also its current site).
Gillespie celebrated his 75th birthday here for four weeks in 1992;
backed by a multitude of jazz greats, he covered his entire corpus.
</P>
<P>
   17. 7 Middagh St., Brooklyn. Richard Wright, whose best-selling
novel, ``Native Son'' (1940), first sounded the militant black note
that bop would make part of the world's music, lived here in an
artists' collective, with Carson McCullers and others, from 1941 to
1943.
</P>
<P>
   18. Dewitt Clinton High School, Bedford Park, the Bronx. Powell
was a student here in the late 1930s, with young James Baldwin. (It
is not recorded whether the two met.) He left school in 1939 to
play piano full time.
</P>
<P>
   19. Creedmore Hospital, Queens Village, Queens. During his first
major breakdown, Powell was treated here, on and off, in 1947-48.
In his few weeks out, he recorded some of his greatest, most
dazzlingly lucid music on the Clef and Blue Note labels.

EUROPE WORRIES ABOUT CONSEQUENCES OF RUSSIAN CRISIS

<P>
   PARIS _ Concern mounted in European capitals Thursday that
Russia's monetary crisis, which is creating turmoil in world
financial markets, could throttle economic growth in their own
countries or weaken Russia's commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the fight of his life
for re-election a month from now and with President Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened
political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive
action during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting planned for next week
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, raised eyebrows with an interview
Monday with the German daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung that was sharply critical of inaction by the Group of Seven
earlier this month when Russia was forced to stop supporting the
value of the ruble against foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that the situation was untenable after the
G-7 didn't rush to Russia's aid,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying. ``I'm not sure Chancellor Helmut Kohl would not have
behaved differently if the elections were taking place two years
instead of weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Germans, of course, no other European country was
ready to support Russia financially,'' he added. ``And since, as we
all know, the American president is weakened at the moment and
can't exercise leadership from a position of strength, the chance
was missed to give a boost to Russia in a situation that was by no
means hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, campaigning in Berlin on Thursday, spoke by telephone with
French President Jacques Chirac of France, German officials said,
and planned to call Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   European political leaders' public advice to Yeltsin and his
prime minister-designate, Victor Chernomyrdin, was the same
Thursday as it has been all along: Without radical changes in the
Russian financial and economic system, more Western help will not
work, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be possible to mobilize German and international aid
without reforms,'' Kohl said. ``Without sensible reforms, it won't
turn out well.''
</P>
<P>
   European officials tried to reassure investors in their own
financial markets Thursday that Russia's economy was too small for
a collapse to do serious damage to their own much larger economies.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders' real concern is not about economic stability
but political stability in Russia, which is still a nuclear power
with an army bigger than all European armed forces put together.
And all European leaders, for years, have backed Yeltsin as the
bulwark of his country's commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fear that this commitment could come unraveled, some financial
analysts suggested, also might explain Thursday's panic in European
markets. ``Sidelining of Mr. Yeltsin Prepared,'' the French
newspaper Le Monde reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Paris stock market fell more than 4 percent, Peter
Thorne, an analyst with Banque Paribas, said Thursday, ``Russia
obviously has nuclear weapons, and I think the psychology is that
Russia is more important than it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials, just emerging from their annual August
vacations, said something needed to be done to reinforce the IMF,
which is providing Russia with a $22.6 billion rescue package. Much
of the latest installment of that money was spent by Russia's
Central Bank in a failed attempt to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, in a speech to French ambassadors from around the world,
said Wednesday that the IMF needed a decision-making political body
at the ministerial level to strengthen its ability to deal with
crises. International aid would only succeed, he said, ``if the
necessary internal reforms supported by President Yeltsin are
resolutely put into effect by the new government of Mr.
Chernomyrdin.''
</P>
<P>
   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the same
thing Thursday after a meeting here with his German counterpart,
Theo Waigel.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn said he and Waigel were considering sending a
letter to Chernomyrdin, who is widely seen in Europe as likely to
proceed slowly with the kind of fiscal and financial changes that
Western experts say are needed to nurse Russia's economy back to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists wondered openly Thursday why the Group of Seven
industrial countries, led by the United States, had not taken a
more active role in managing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, Russia has been pretending to observe the
conditions imposed by the IMF and the IMF has been pretending that
it was doing so,'' Christian de Boissieu, an economics professor at
the Sorbonne, told the influential French daily newspaper Le Monde.
``The G-7 should take over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have asked why the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in London, founded to help free-market economies emerge
in Russia and other former Soviet republics and satellites, has not
played a more prominent role in the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn said that officials of the Group of Seven countries
_ the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan, Britain, France and
Italy _ were in close contact.

   BOEING-EXPLOSION (Seattle) The aftermath of Boeing Delta III
explosion. Experts say Boeing has a lost a golden opportunity to
take the early lead in the lucrative launch business over European
and Chinese competitors with last night's dramatic failure of its
new heavy lift rocket that cost more than $1.5 billion to develop.
What happens now depends on the investigation. If it's a simple
fix, Delta III could be ready again within 4-6 months. If a design
flaw, the program could be facing a long and potentially
devastating setback. Boeing said data shows rocket began to go out
of control 55 seconds into flight and was then blown up. Boeing's
stock down slightly today, and analysts say it will loose less than
a half cent per share of revenue after taxes as a result of the
Delta 3 setback. But the stock of PanAmSat, the satellite's owner,
is down more than 17 percent after the company said it would cost
the firm about $200 million in revenues this year. Satellite was
insured, this is just revenue loss.

NO OTHER WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past six months, I have been predicting
that the only way President Clinton will ever quiet the Monica
Lewinsky scandal is to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Clinton associates have dismissed that as a unrealistic
notion on the grounds that he is by nature a fighter and not a
quitter. They simply could not envision him voluntarily walking
away from the job he fought so hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the president's troubles have escalated so dramatically
since his partial confession to an improper dalliance with the
former White House intern that what once seemed improbable now
looks like the best way out.
</P>
<P>
   His initial instinct in the face of hordes of current calls for
his resignation may be to dig in his heels and defy them all. But
eventually he will do it. Not because it is the right thing to do.
He is not in the habit of acting for that reason. He will do it
because he must.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Clinton remains in office, the relentless trashing of
both the occupant and the institution of the presidency will never
abate. Two more years of this would be too much to take.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot begin to rehabilitate himself politically until he is
no longer the focus of power and is off center stage, back in
private life. Handing over the Oval Office to Vice President Al
Gore would immediately give the country fresh leadership,
reassuring continuity and relief from the political heartburn of
lechery in high places.
</P>
<P>
   If evidence of any more Clinton lechery appears in Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's pending report to Congress, voters will
find it virtually impossible to continue separating the president's
private conduct from his public performance, as many have thus far
been doing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet impeachment has always seemed a disproportionate, irrational
way out. It would be shameful if Congress went that far and if
Clinton himself let it go that far.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment and criminal trial in a regular court would be a
legal and historical outrage, given the constitutional separation
of powers. That should not happen and few think it will.
</P>
<P>
   The third alternative, congressional censure, would generate
considerable psychological and political pain but have no legal
impact. While it would leave Clinton in office, it would rupture
White House relations with Congress and grind the nation's business
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The national preoccupation with presidential sex will never end
so long as Clinton remains in the White House. It will continue to
distract and disrupt the country. It is demoralizing his Democratic
supporters. As I wrote in February, he cannot outrun this.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no responsible option for him except a graceful
exit, in his own time, on his own terms, in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think that time has yet come, despite the current calls
for his resignation. But it is inevitably approaching.
</P>
<P>
   More of this drama must play out before a voluntary presidential
departure would be appropriate. Starr's report will clarify issues
about which we are still only speculating. Congress must register
its collective reaction in some preliminary way to Starr's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The fall election will settle the question of whether Clinton
will face a strengthened Republican majority or a somewhat more
friendly Democratic-controlled House. And if Gore is to have the
constitutional option of serving two full terms as president, he
cannot inherit the White House until Jan. 21. (The Constitution
limits any unelected president to one full, elected term if he has
served more than two years before he runs for election).
</P>
<P>
   One development unlikely to happen is a further Clinton
explanation of his sexual adventures with Lewinsky. There's not
much he can say that will make people approve of what went on.
Silence is the wisest course here.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been Clinton-haters who want his head on a
platter, no matter what the justification, so they can press their
own policy agenda free of his interference. I do not fall into that
category. I mostly approve of his public performance and believe he
has been sincerely trying to do what is best for the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the resignation talk now comes not from a vast right-wing
conspiracy but from editorial writers and other nonpartisan
observers who are genuinely concerned that Clinton is such damaged
goods he can no longer govern.

<P>
   DETROIT _ Mitsubishi's advertising line for its 1999 Galant,
``Wake up and drive,'' is aimed at prospective buyers, but it could
also apply to the company's marketing subsidiary in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For three consecutive years, Mitsubishi has sold fewer than
200,000 cars and trucks in this country; Toyota sells that many in
two months. Mitsubishi's plant in Normal, Ill., hasn't run at full
capacity since it opened in 1988. The Japanese parent company
suffered a $740 million net loss last year, and its credit rating
was recently cut by Moody's Investors Service.
</P>
<P>
   Operations in the United States have provided a crucial profit,
but the parent needs more. So the American managers have received
an edict: Wake up and drive, or else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi installed new managers for its U.S. marketing
operation, based in California, and they have responded, moving to
reorganize the company and revitalize its network of dealers. The
company has adopted a new brand identity with a theme of ``Spirited
Products for Spirited People.'' A single ad agency with a
consistent message has replaced the dozen agencies that produced
corporate and dealer advertising. and now Mitsubishi has introduced
a new version of its best-selling vehicle, the midsize Galant, that
embodies many of the changes at the company. This is not just the
crucial debut of a make-or-break car, but the re-introduction of an
entire franchise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After driving two versions of the Galant, I concluded that
Mitsubishi was on track with both the car and its brand image.
Backed by an attention-grabbing advertising campaign _ at nearly
$50 million, it is the company's largest ever _ the Galant should
finally be noticed. After years in which the previous car remained
largely anonymous, the all-new model rates a spot on anyone's
shopping list of midsize family sedans.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is fierce in this market, and the Galant goes
head to head with the two best-selling cars in America last year _
the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord _ along with the Mazda 626 and
Nissan Altima, the new Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Alero, and a
host of other competent cars from import and domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
   In their dimensions, all these midsize sedans seem stamped from
the same cookie cutter. The Galant has moved from the compact class
to midsize status, as determined by the Environmental Protection
Agency's system of measuring interior space. The '99 is a tad
longer, taller and wider than the model it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   So Mitsubishi asked itself how it could compete with Honda and
Accord, since its car's proportions are nearly identical and its
features are virtually the same. It has less to spend on
advertising and fewer dealers to push its product.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it needed to establish a brand image, since
consumer surveys found that 25 people gave 25 different answers to
the question of the company stood for. Responses ranged from a
``maker of exciting, high-tech vehicles'' to ``the best deal in
town.'' Worse, many consumers knew Mitsubishi made cars, but could
say nothing beyond that about the company or its products. On a
more positive note, many consumers gave the company's vehicles a
higher fun factor than its competitors, which led to the ``spirited
vehicles'' line.
</P>
<P>
   Once that theme was established, Mitsubishi's new advertising
agency, Deutsch Inc., developed an MTV-style campaign suggesting
that a mainstream family can have the practicality of a Camry and
Accord, plus some excitement. The teaser ads heralding the Galant's
arrival this summer suggested that ``there is life after four
doors.'' Another showed a Galant racing through urban streets while
a narrator says: ``You have a family. You have a house. You have a
dog. You have a pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting the vehicle, Mitsubishi emphasizes styling,
spirited performance and a strong value. The Galant's primary
design originated in Japan, but for the first time the automaker's
California studio modified the exterior slightly. The Galant has an
attractive, sweeping roofline, which reminded me somewhat of the
latest Volkswagen Passat. Sharp side creases and a squared-off rear
deck lid give the Galant a tailored look. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi's American styling studio also designed a different
interior for the United States market. The most noticeable change
is that the audio system now resides in a more handy place, above
the climate controls. The interior is tasteful, attractive and
comfortable, with the controls logically situated and easy to
operate. But like all Japanese-made midsize cars, it is quite
generic. Were it not for the name badges, even the best-informed
consumer would probably not be able to tell one cabin from another.
</P>
<P>
   The Galant comes in four trim levels. The DE remains the entry
model, though it accounts for only a small percentage of sales. The
midlevel ES is most popular, and is expected to account for
three-quarters of sales. The LS is the most luxurious version. And
a new model, the sporty, limited-edition GTZ, joins the line for
the first time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every model comes with air-conditioning, power windows and door
locks, an AM/FM radio with cassette player, an auxiliary 12-volt
power outlet in the center of the dashboard, variable intermittent
wipers, solar tinted glass and two trip odometers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safety equipment includes optional side air bags. Anti-lock
brakes are optional on four-cylinder models, standard on V6
versions. The Galant, however, lacks a three-point belt for the
middle rear passenger, a feature that the Camry and Accord have. I
like these center shoulder belts, believing that they help to
protect the children I transport in a parents' car pool.
</P>
<P>
   The new Galant is quiet, and it seems to have achieved its goal
of matching the near-silence of the Camry. A companion climbed
behind the wheel and could not tell that the engine was running.
</P>
<P>
   The Galant sets itself apart from the Camry, and most of the
other cars in its class, in the way it performs. With either
engine, it is a spirited performer, and surprisingly fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Mitsubishi convinced its Japanese parent to
equip the American version with a powertrain different from those
sold in Japan. Instead of the 1.8-liter four-cylinder in Japanese
versions, the Illinois-made Galant has a 2.4-liter four rated at
145 horsepower, significantly more than the Accord, Camry and 626.
With 155 foot-pounds of torque, more than its prime competitors,
the Galant is quick away from stoplights and it dashes around
slower-moving cars in highway passing maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the first time, the Galant is available with a V6
engine, as are the Accord and Camry. Mitsubishi expects nearly a
third of Galant buyers to select the V6, a 3-liter power plant
derived from the engine in the Montero Sport. The Galant V6
produces 195 horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque, nearly
identical to the Camry's rating.
</P>
<P>
   For now, both Mitsubishi engines come with a new,
smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission that adapts its
shifting pattern to the driver's style. Unfortunately, no manual
transmission is currently available. A five-speed manual will be
offered later in the model year, but only with the four-cylinder
engine. This seems short-sighted; though fewer buyers are choosing
stick shifts, their availability would seem essential in a car
intended to be a sporty alternative to the leaders of the class,
most of which do offer a manual. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the American-built Galant also differs from
the Japanese version. MacPherson struts replace the multilink front
suspension of the previous Galant for improved stability, more
responsive handling and easier manufacturing. The GTZ model that I
drove has tighter suspension tuning, making it fun to toss around;
a rear spoiler and black-on-white gauges add to its flair.
Nevertheless, my second test car, a four-cylinder ES, proved that
even a more basic version could be fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Galant has always attracted bargain hunters, since its slow
sales allowed customers to wheel and deal. The new models start off
with attractive prices. The base model is $17,410, including
delivery, slightly under the least expensive 1999 Camry. The Galant
ES V6 is an even better deal, starting at $20,410 _ some $2,000
less than V6 versions of the Camry, Accord and 626. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the new Galant, Mitsubishi set out to emphasize styling,
lively performance and a strong value. On all counts, it seems to
have achieved its goals.

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Fears of an economic meltdown in Russia
sent shockwaves through Germany and put heavy new pressures on
Central Europe on Thursday, but many economists and government
officials said the reaction was driven more by market psychology
than economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, the Budapest stock exchange plunged 15 percent, and
the central bank intervened to shore up confidence in its currency,
the forint.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, which after Germany is the second-largest exporter to
Russia, government leaders warned the country to brace for slower
growth and more stringent economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare ourselves for a certain domestic shock
effect, because the export possibilities will shrink,'' warned
Polish Finance Minister Leszek Bacerowicz. Polish officials have
trimmed their growth projections for next year from 6 percent to
about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the stock market plunged almost 4 percent Thursday
amid continued worries about German banks, which have been by far
the biggest lenders to Russia. Wednesday, Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered
its rating for Deutsche Bank, which holds about $750 million in
unguaranteed loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, one of Russia's most stalwart
supporters, warned that Moscow would have no hope of further
outside financial help unless it began carrying out long-promised
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the reforms, it will not be possible to mobilize money
either from international financial organizations or from
Germany,'' Kohl told reporters Thursday in Berlin. ``If they don't
follow through, the situation will look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Russian crisis spooked almost every market
in the world, many economists and government leaders said that
Russia's direct economic impact on other countries remains modest.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most important economic assets are its vast reserves of
natural resources, from oil and gas to metals like nickel, platinum
and gold. But the financial crisis is at most likely to accelerate
the production and export of those commodities, in order for Russia
to obtain hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, German banks aren't quite so exposed as the numbers
suggest. At least 90 percent of their $30.5 billion in outstanding
loans to Russia are guaranteed by the German government. As a
result, analysts and bank executives continue to believe that they
face little more than a bad case of heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   That means that it is the German government _ which could end up
with a bill of $10 billion to $20 billion to clean up the mess _
that will to bear the brunt of the financial burden. ``The Russian
problems are usually discussed in terms of the impact on the German
banks, but they should probably be discussed in terms of their
impact on German public finances,'' noted Holger Schmieding, senior
European economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, losses from the guarantees Bonn made _ in part as a
political gesture to Russia for its support of German reunification
_ will not all come in one year, giving the government breathing
room to prepare itself.
</P>
<P>
   The economic repercussions in Germany of Russia's crisis are
also likely to be muted. While Germany is also the world's biggest
exporter to Russia, that trade accounts for only about 5 percent of
the country's total sales abroad and 0.2 percent of its economic
output.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's darkest shadows were cast over Central European
nations, which have thus far have managed to avoid being tarred by
the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have the biggest
economies within Central Europe. Though the Czech Republic remains
mired in its own economic problems, Poland and Hungary have
maintained strong growth and continued to draw heavy foreign
investment in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But now those two countries are struggling to avoid the
guilt-by-association based on their historic ties to Russia.
Analysts said the stock markets in both were also hammered by
foreign investors who had lost heavily in Russia and were selling
the central European stocks to cover those losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are irrationally trying to sell, while there are really
few buyers,'' said Christian Faber, a trader at Wood &AMP; Co. in
Warsaw, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. ``A number of funds that
need money are forcing this selling situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, the Polish zloty has declined by about 8
percent against the U.S. dollar. Prices on the Warsaw stock
exchange dropped about 6 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski warned Thursday that the
country will have to follow stringent economic policies to prevent
its own credibility from being damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not add our own virus to the viruses coming from
abroad,'' Krasniewski told reporters in Krakow on Thursday. ``We
must be persistent about reforms, financial discipline and measures
increasing exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian markets were badly rattled as well. Though the forint
has been relatively stable, the central bank intervened to support
the currency Thursday after it slipped about 2 percent against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising was the plunge in Hungary's stock market, which
has been one of the most vibrant and one of the best performers in
Central Europe. In the past week, prices on the Budapest stock
exchange have declined about 20 percent, and most of that decline
took place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   National Bank of Hungary president Gyorgi Suranyi said Thursday
night the fears have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I foresee a relatively modest impact from the Russian crisis,
because the fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are very
strong,'' said Suranyi in a telephone interview. Hungary's economy
is growing at an annual rate of 5 percent and its exports are
climbing 20 percent this year. Only a negligible 4 percent of
exports go to Russia, while about 70 percent go to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of Russia in the world economy cannot be considered
that great,'' said Suranyi. But he added: ``If it creates a
subsequent spillover that affects North America or the European
Union, then we definitely will have to face greater challenges.''

   JonBenet Ramsey's aunt speaks out
</P>
<P>
   By Craig Schneider
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The family of JonBenet Ramsey welcomes the upcoming grand jury
probe into the girl's slaying, expecting it will shift attention
from the girl's parents to finding the true killers, said the
girl's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know who killed our baby _ wouldn't you?,'' said
Pam Paugh in metro Atlanta, the 39-year-old sister of Patsy Ramsey,
JonBenet's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Paugh said she spoke to her sister by phone this week. The
Ramseys, who now live in Atlanta, were on vacation. But Paugh said
the case is always on their minds. ``They are making it
hour-by-hour,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have declined to say when the Boulder, Colo., grand
jury could hear the case, but it could begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Paugh said she has spoken to authorities several times and has
been told she will be called to testify. She is eager to do so.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think the things that need to be looked at will come to
light for the grand jurors. They will say, 'That doesn't jibe. Go
after that one, or go look that this further. ' ''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed confidence in Boulder District Attorney Alex
Hunter and Boulder police. Paugh has her own theory and list of
three suspects, whom she would not identify. None are family
members.
</P>
<P>
   She believes the killer is ``almost a genius mastermind,''
someone who knew the family well, who perhaps was jealous of the
their closeness and success.
</P>
<P>
   Paugh is a department store make-up artist who applied
JonBenet's makeup for several child beauty pageants. Her home has
many photos and keepsakes of the girl, who was 6 when she was found
beaten and strangled in the basement of her family's Boulder home
Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Paugh knows some may view her statements as a calculated move,
coming just before the grand jury meets. ``There will always be
naysayers. God knows the truth,'' she said. She is promoting a book
supportive of Patsy Ramsey called ``JonBenet's Mother: The Tragedy
and the Truth.'' It includes excerpts from Patsy's friends.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy, she said, remain devastated by their loss, a
tragedy compounded by the swirl of media attention and speculation.
About Patsy, she said, ``You can get to a point when you're so
broken and so beaten, that no matter how hard they kick, you almost
don't feel it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Paugh has lost patience with some in the media. ``If Geraldo
Rivera calls my sister a murderer one more time, I will probably
lose my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When she visited JonBenet's grave on the girl's birthday, she
said, she found a small tape recorder under the bench near the
grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first tragedy is that someone, or some group, has murdered
my niece, brutally, heinously,'' she said. ``The second tragedy is
the whirlwind around this event, if you can call it that.
Speculation is a terrible, terrible thing.

   &UR; Emma Thompson &LR;  may not be a first lady, but she played a first
lady in ``Primary Colors.'' At the opening of that movie at the
Edinburgh International Film Festival this week, Thompson gave her
unvarnished opinion of her role model and her role model's nemesis:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton  &LR; ``is pretty amazing,'' said the actress. ``One
of the things we have to face up to is that sex and power have gone
hand in hand for thousands of years. What is unusual about this
situation is  &UR; Ken Starr &LR; . The investigation is terrifying. I find
Starr a terribly frightening figure. It is extraordinary the powers
he has, this  &UR; J. Edgar Hoover &LR;  incarnation.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Dick Morris &LR; , who was adviser to  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  before he was
caught telling secrets to a girlfriend he hired by the hour, took a
tone of high disapproval in an op-ed piece in Wednesday's New York
Post. The president has let the  &UR; Lewinsky &LR;  scandal distract him,
writes this wise counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Citing failed tobacco legislation, thwarted education and child
care proposals and unfixed problems in the Social Security system,
Morris asserts, ``The blunt fact is that Bill Clinton has not been
a very good president since the Lewinsky scandal darkened his
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanity Fair reported last summer that New York Mayor  &UR; Rudolph &LR; 
 &UR; Giuliani &LR;  was having an ``intimate'' relationship with his
communications director; then, when the mayor ran for re-election,
his wife,  &UR; Donna Hanover &LR; , refused to join him during the campaign.
Does this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reports that the Giulianis have been attending
church together recently and even hosting dinners. ``They're
spending more time together,'' said one dinner guest. ``They're
trying to get along. He's making a conscious effort to spend more
time with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nostalgic  &UR; John Bix  &LR; forwards a clipping from March 27, 1995,
in which  &UR; Herb Caen  &LR; described ``an amazingly sexy affair'' between
the deputy governor of the Bank of England, married, and an unnamed
sweetheart. Much of this relationship was said to have been carried
out on the floor in the office of the man's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we have scandals as juicy as the Brits'?'' wrote
Caen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Washington Times reports on claims in the official
newspaper of the Palestinian Authority that Monica Lewinsky is a
Zionist secret agent who purposely embroiled Clinton in scandal to
distract the president from encouraging Israel to withdraw from
occupied Palestinian lands. Meanwhile, the Jewish newspaper the
Forward says the president has been spending at least part of his
vacation reading the Psalms.

SHEILA'S FLAG ON A QUEST AT TRAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Trainer Elliott Walden has seen enough.
After watching Victory Gallop, who won the Belmont Stakes after
finishing second in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, chase
Coronado's Quest around the track to no avail in the Haskell at
Monmouth Aug. 9, he sought a solution to the problem _ a solution
with long ears.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sheila's Flag, a 14-karat rabbit, whom Walden put into
Saturday's 129th running of the $750,000 Travers Stakes at Saratoga
to ensure that Coronado's Quest does not have things all his way
during the 1 1/4-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was entered by design,'' said Walden. ``I just didn't say
anything about it because I didn't want you guys asking a lot of
questions. I don't know if we'll actually run him, we'll just see
how it plays out. I'm not sure if it's right to say that we entered
him for a fast pace. The best word is `honest.' We just want to
make sure that we have an honest pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila's Flag is an allowance horse who has won only two races
in eight starts and has never raced past a mile. He has about as
much chance as a $4,000 claimer at Rockingham Park of winning the
Travers. But his Prestonwood Farm stablemate, Victory Gallop, is
the real deal who has been first or second in his last 10 starts
(six wins) and was listed Thursday as the 7-5 favorite for the
Travers, just ahead of Coronado's Quest at 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he ran a great race in the Haskell,'' said Walden
of Victory Gallop, who trailed Coronado's Quest by a length and
one-quarter. ``What might have hurt us a little bit is that, from
the eighth-pole in, he couldn't get outside. Coronado's Quest was
weaving all over the place. When he took dead aim on Real Quiet
(winner of the Derby and Preakness) in the Belmont, he came from
outside, not inside. We need to save as much ground as possible in
a race of this magnitude; we learned that in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the distance of the Travers, the wider turns, the
length of the stretch, and the fact that he's sitting on a big race
are all in his favor. He's done well after competing in the Triple
Crown. Durability is one of his attributes. People should give him
credit for it. He's still here fighting the battles. I think a lot
of that has to do with his size. He's not an overly big type horse.
He's more athletic, he has a more nifty step than a larger horse
has.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that might work against Victory Gallop is that he has
lost the services of outstanding jockey Gary Stevens, who rode him
in the Preakness, Belmont, and Haskell. Stevens was injured at Del
Mar Sunday, tearing cartilage in a knee while trying to control an
unruly 2-year-old during warmups. Victory Gallop will now be ridden
by Alex Solis, who was replaced folowing an overland tour in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex rode him very well in the Derby and the Arkansas Derby,''
said a diplomatic Walden. ``He's been victorious on him (in
Arkansas). We're very fortunate that Alex has been on him and we
can get him in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Real Quiet out for the year with stifle problems, the race
for the 3-year-old championship could well be decided in the
Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as confident as I can be,'' said Walden. ``I wouldn't
change places with anybody on Saturday. Of course, that doesn't
assure winning. He's been working well on the main track. He's
thrived on it. In every work he's had here, he's gone the last
eighth in around :11. That's a big-time race horse. I think if he
wins the Travers he should be 3-year-old champion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, who trains Coronado's Quest, was unfazed by
Walden entering a rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be influenced by what anybody else does,'' said
McGaughey of his cantankerous but talented charge, who has won his
last four starts and will be ridden by the meet's leading jockey,
Mike Smith. ``He'll be laying up close. If that horse goes out,
we'll track him. Let them do what they feel they have to do. I'm
not worring about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to have fun. I'm looking at Saturday as a fun day for
me. I've learned that, when you have the goods, you should enjoy
yourself. It's different if you're taking over an 8-1 shot that
you're just hoping will run well. Coronado's Quest is a good horse.
We always knew he was a good horse, and we're happy that he's been
showing it lately.''

   &UR; Emma Thompson &LR;  may not be a first lady, but she played a first
lady in ``Primary Colors.'' At the opening of that movie at the
Edinburgh International Film Festival this week, Thompson gave her
unvarnished opinion of her role model and her role model's nemesis:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton  &LR; ``is pretty amazing,'' said the actress. ``One
of the things we have to face up to is that sex and power have gone
hand in hand for thousands of years. What is unusual about this
situation is  &UR; Ken Starr &LR; . The investigation is terrifying. I find
Starr a terribly frightening figure. It is extraordinary the powers
he has, this  &UR; J. Edgar Hoover &LR;  incarnation.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Dick Morris &LR; , who was adviser to  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  before he was
caught telling secrets to a girlfriend he hired by the hour, took a
tone of high disapproval in an op-ed piece in Wednesday's New York
Post. The president has let the  &UR; Lewinsky &LR;  scandal distract him,
writes this wise counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Citing failed tobacco legislation, thwarted education and child
care proposals and unfixed problems in the Social Security system,
Morris asserts, ``The blunt fact is that Bill Clinton has not been
a very good president since the Lewinsky scandal darkened his
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanity Fair reported last summer that New York Mayor  &UR; Rudolph &LR; 
 &UR; Giuliani &LR;  was having an ``intimate'' relationship with his
communications director; then, when the mayor ran for re-election,
his wife,  &UR; Donna Hanover &LR; , refused to join him during the campaign.
Does this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reports that the Giulianis have been attending
church together recently and even hosting dinners. ``They're
spending more time together,'' said one dinner guest. ``They're
trying to get along. He's making a conscious effort to spend more
time with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Nostalgic  &UR; John Bix  &LR; forwards a clipping from March 27, 1995,
in which  &UR; Herb Caen  &LR; described ``an amazingly sexy affair'' between
the deputy governor of the Bank of England, married, and an unnamed
sweetheart. Much of this relationship was said to have been carried
out on the floor in the office of the man's boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we have scandals as juicy as the Brits'?'' wrote
Caen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Washington Times reports on claims in the official
newspaper of the Palestinian Authority that Monica Lewinsky is a
Zionist secret agent who purposely embroiled Clinton in scandal to
distract the president from encouraging Israel to withdraw from
occupied Palestinian lands. Meanwhile, the Jewish newspaper the
Forward says the president has been spending at least part of his
vacation reading the Psalms.

<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ A series of poems by  &UR; Thom Gunn &LR;  about  &UR; Jeffrey Dahmer  &LR; is the
text for ``Troubadour,'' a song cycle by  &UR; Jay Lyon  &LR; that will be
performed Sunday in San Francisco. A group of disapproving
listeners walked out of a reading of the poems in Chicago, says
Gunn, but they probably wouldn't have minded poems about
 &UR; Napoleon &LR;  or  &UR; Julius Caesar &LR; , who certainly claimed more victims.
As for Dahmer, ``I'm writing about him like Shakespeare wrote about
Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Mary Tyler Moore &LR;  was toilet-trained by the time she was 12
months old, reports Biography magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I don't think anybody has the right or need to see my penis.
Nobody needs that to continue living their life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Actor Ryan Phillippe explaining why he refused to do full
frontal nudity in the new movie ``54.'' Phillippe's statement, from
the Los Angeles newspaper Fab, was gleaned by Ken Maley.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent, among other people, said, `You shouldn't do Playboy
again because people are just starting to take you seriously.' I
thought, `How sad. Do I have to sacrifice being perceived as a
sensual woman in order to be taken seriously?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; _ &LR;  Cindy Crawford, in People magazine, on a nude Playboy photo
spread that will appear in October, 10 years after her first nude
photo spread. Crawford admits that ``some things aren't quite as
high or perky as they were.''

   It's late at night and you suddenly feel chest pains. Do you
call an ambulance or figure that it can wait until the morning?
Lenane offers tips on how to determine whether various ailments _
skipped heartbeat, chest pain, cramps, night sweats, dizziness _
are likely to be serious enough for a 3 a.m. run to the emergency

   As people age, they tend to suffer memory loss. Glicksman
discusses the three types of memory _ long-term, intermediate and
short-term _ and how each is affected by the aging process. She
also offers strategies on how to keep one's memory sharp. ``Much
like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning,'' she writes. (slugged:

   ``Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function

   Millions of senior citizens and their offspring wrestle with the
difficult and often heartrending problem of where the elderly
should live when they can no longer cope alone at home. These days
nursing homes or moving in with the children are not the only

 By FLORENCE FELDMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

 c.1997 McCall's 
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

YANKOWSKI NEW CEO AT REEBOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to break out of its slump and placate unhappy investors,
Reebok International Ltd. Thursday named Carl Yankowski president
and chief executive of the Reebok brand, the fourth person to hold
that position in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yankowski, a well-traveled executive whose resume includes stops
at PepsiCo Inc., Polaroid Corp., and Sony Electronics Inc., will
replace Robert Meers and report to company chairman Paul B.
Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   With $3.64 billion in sales Reebok is the world's second largest
maker of athletic shoes behind Nike Inc. But Reebok, based in
Stoughton, Mass., is in danger of being overtaken by Adidas AG.
</P>
<P>
   If Yankowski can rejuvenate Reebok, he would be a likely
candidate to succeed Fireman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fireman has previously hinted he might step down if he
couldn't improve Reebok's bottom line, he reiterated again yesteday
that he has no plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intentions are to continue,'' said Fireman, who added
later: ``I'm not just walking out the door by any means. I'm
partnering with Carl to restore the luster of the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Yankowski, who said he holds two degrees from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has picked a difficult
time to make his debut in the footwear industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Reebok was an industry laggard as Nike
sprinted ahead with Michael Jordan and its ``Just do it''
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now with a glut of sneakers on the market and with consumers
less susceptible to the marketing pitches of superstar athletes,
most companies are struggling, including Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is anecdotal, but by no means conclusive,
evidence that some young consumers are more inclined to buy hiking
boots rather than athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole industry is very soft,'' said Dick Silverman, the
associate publisher and executive editor of two trade publications,
Footwear News and Sportstyle Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for Yankowski is ``how Reebok is going to
differentiate itself from its main competitor,'' said Laidlaw
Global Securities analyst Peter A. Russ in a reference to Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Yankowski, an engineer by training, acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting sneaker stores, he noted that Reebok products tend
to get lost in the huge ``walls of shoes'' that retailers use to
display their wares.
</P>
<P>
   His marketing priorities would be to make Reebok stand out at
retail and do a better job of delivering the message of how Reebok
products benefit consumers, Yankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Reebok might change ad agencies again?
</P>
<P>
   Reebok currently uses four ad agencies, including two in Boston,
Heater Advertising and its sister shop, the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to reserve judgment on that,'' Yankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Yankowski said he's helped boost number two brands before. At
Pepsi, he helped improved Mountain Dew's market share, and he takes
partial credit for a famous ad campaign of 25 years ago that had
the tagline, ``Is it live or is it Memorex?.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireman, meanwhile, noted that Sony's sales soared during
Yankowski's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Given the turmoil in the footwear industry, many companies have
seen high turnover, perhaps few more than Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   If stability is part of what's needed to revitalize Reebok,
Yankowski may not be the man to provide it, analyst Russ said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who's spent 2 1/2 and three years at a lot of
places,'' Russ said of Yankowski. ``He doesn't look like a culture
builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Meers, Yankowski's predecessor, who will continue to assist
Fireman in an undefined role, made a three-year commitment to lead
the Reebok brand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he will stay with Reebok, Yankowski replied,
``I'm prepared to stay as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite industrywide turbulence, there are some bright spots for
Reebok, said Silverman of Footwear News. New shoe lines
incorporating Reebok's DMX cushioning system have sold well.
</P>
<P>
   While that news should cheer investors, many won't be satisfied
until Fireman steps down, Russ said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think investors will be happy until Fireman goes,''
Russ said. ``He can put a lot of Band-Aids on the wounds, but the
big problem Reebok faces is what Paul Fireman sees when he looks in
the mirror in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the stock markets plunged, Reebok shares hit a
52-week low, dropping 1/2 to close at 15 5/16 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Less than a year ago, Reebok shares were trading just
below 50.

DEMOCRATS GRAPPLE WITH CLINTON SAGA ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A pall has settled over areas of the country where
Democrats had hoped to pick up congressional seats this November,
leaving party leaders wondering whether they can overcome
uneasiness generated by President Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   With well-financed candidates and a heavily bankrolled plan to
turn out the party faithful, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., had hoped Clinton's popularity and a steady economy would
help Democrats retake Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But as more details of Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky leak out, party activists say it's anybody's guess as to
how voters are going to react Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed this might overshadow more important
issues,'' long-time Democrat Penny Gold of Louisville, Ky., said
earlier this week as Gephardt campaigned in her hometown for
attorney Chris Gorman, who is challenging Republican incumbent Anne
Northup in what's expected to be one of the most competitive races
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The issues _ education, preserving Social Security, and managed
health care _ are what Gephardt tried to concentrate on during a
campaign swing through eight states this week. But as he wound down
his three-day trek from Pennsylvania to Washington state, he looked
weary and worried about whether his message was getting through to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after answering yet another question from
reporters about what impact ``the president's problem'' might have
on the elections, Gephardt moaned, ``Isn't it time we had an
election in this country on an issue?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we'd all rather this (Lewinsky controversy) not be a
focus at all,'' the minority leader said. But he said Democrats
can't continue to wring their hands over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as disappointed as anybody, but that's history. It's time
to move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But business as usual could be difficult as details about the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship emerge and independent counsel
Kenneth Starr prepares to send a report to Congress that could lead
to impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's troubles, said pollster Bill McInturff of Public
Opinion Strategies, is ``sucking up all the oxygen'' in terms of
the attention Democrats had hoped to stress on real issue
differences with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the Lewinsky controversy, the Democrats could
be focusing on a Clinton record they claim has boosted the economy,
reduced crime and saved education programs from Republican attempts
to scrap them.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that, McInturff said, has been ``talked away'' to a
large extent by the national focus on the president's admitted
relationship with the young former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lewinsky problem is nor viewed as seriously as the
Watergate scandal, McInturff said it contains echoes of 1974 when
lots of Republicans stayed home in mid-term elections after
President Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nightmare scenario for Democrats,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats need to pick up 11 seats to take control of the
House. They hope that a bigger labor turnout and better-financed
candidates will make the difference in 30 races they consider
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt acknowledged that the president's problem could
``depress turnout generally.'' Still, he insisted that the party
``can win the House with whatever is going on'' come Election Day
``if we've got the right candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   A new poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press may give Gephardt some hope that in the end the
Lewinsky matter won't make a difference. The poll found that 61
percent of likely voters say the president's troubles won't affect
how they vote on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we don't see any less interest in Democratic voters
with regard to turnout,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
center.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin auto worker Dave Townsend said he plans to support
Democrat Lydia Spotswood of Kenosha in her bid to unseat Republican
Rep. Mark Neumann because of the Lewinsky matter, and he believes
other Democrats and independent voters will be moved to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an important election for dealing with issues,
regardless of what's going on with Clinton,'' he said. ``And I
think if the Republicans continue to try and make an issue out of
him and Monica Lewinsky it's going to probably give them a black
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too early to tell what impact the matter will have on
voter turnout, but Clinton's troubles have so far shown no sign of
eroding his appeal among party donors.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials say they are still ``on track'' to raise
their goal of $3 million in mid-September at a big New York
fund-raiser with the president. They expect to raise more than that
at a Los Angeles fund-raiser featuring the president in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the New York event is any indication, I don't see any
problem,'' said one Democratic Party official. But the official
emphasized that candidates this fall will be less dependent on the
president and the national party for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to recruit good candidates in this election cycle
who could raise their own money,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also plan to spend more than $2 million on
get-out-the-vote efforts this year in a handful of close races,
which is nearly five times what the party spent on all the 1996
races.

MASSACHUSETTS GETS LOW RATES FOR $500 MILLION OF NEW BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thursday's big stock market decline may have had some
equity investors ripping out their hair, but it provided a golden
opportunity for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to issue $1
billion in debt at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The state issued $500 million in new 20-year bonds at a
favorable 4.89 percent interest rate, and refinanced another $500
million in bond debt in a two-part deal that resulted in an even
better 4.17 percent rate. In that transaction, the state replaced
$500 million in existing high-interest bonds with more attractive
variable-rate bonds, and then immediately swapped them, through a
competitive bidding process, to lock in a low fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Massachusetts taxpayers will save an estimated $25
million in debt payments (based on the value of today's dollars)
over the 20-year life of the bonds, said First Deputy Treasurer
Thomas Trimarco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a very successful transaction,'' Trimarco said.
``We were positioned to be in the bond market at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The attractive bond deal was made possible because of Thursday's
357-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market dives, investors typically pull their
money out of volatile stocks and seek more secure havens, such as
money market accounts and US Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike stocks, which represent ownership in a company, bonds
represent debt. Investors who buy bonds agree to lend money to a
government or corporation at a particular interest rate to finance
various capital projects.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fluctuate based on prevailing interest rates. If the
bond is paying more interest than the rate generally available
elsewhere, people will pay more for it. Likewise, if the bond is
paying less than prevailing interest rates, it becomes less
attractive, and the bond price falls.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on municipal bonds, like the ones issued Thursday by the
Commonwealth, typically track those of US Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   When the demand for these bonds surges, as it did Thursday,
prices go up and yields _ the bond's interest rate divided by its
purchase price _ go down.
</P>
<P>
   The state had already been planning to sell bonds Thursday, but
decided to issue even more debt when it sensed the market
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just fortuitous timing,'' Trimarco said Thursday. ``We
went to bed last night thinking our deal today would be worth
somewhere between $800 million and $900 million,'' he said. But
because bond rates were so favorable, the state boosted the amount
to $1 billion.

MORE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS APPEAR TO SHIFT AWAY FROM STOCKS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Individual investors, whose determination to buy
stocks whenever the market takes a tumble has been the bulwark of
the bull market of the 1990s, appear to be weakening under the
weight of a monthlong decline in equity prices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, individuals have been pouring more of their new
cash into the safe haven of money-market funds than into any other
investment category, while at the same time many of them have been
pulling money out of stocks. So far, August appears to be the
weakest month for new purchases of equity mutual funds in several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's largest sellers of mutual funds _
including Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and T. Rowe
Price Associates _ said Thursday their customers have pulled more
money out of equity funds in August than they put in. Others,
however, including the Vanguard Group, say that investors have been
net buyers of equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the fund companies report a significant jump in flows
of cash into money market and fixed-income funds, another shelter
typically sought by investors in times of market turmoil. In
addition, there are signs that the skittishness has spread to
investors in 401(k) and similar retirement plans, who typically
have been less likely to make quick shifts from one asset class to
another.
</P>
<P>
   What apparently has been weighing on investors' resolve is the
slow-and- steady decline of stock prices since the market indexes
hit new highs in July. A volatile market has provided a few days of
rapid gains, but those have inevitably been followed by further
declines, as the slump has stretched from days into weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while broad market indicators like the Dow Jones
industrial average still show gains for the year, a growing number
of mutual funds, which generally buy stocks that are smaller than
those in the market indexes, have lost money since the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even at fund companies where investors have continued to buy
equity funds, they appear less steadfast than in previous market
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cash flow remains strong, but the numbers appear to be
very volatile,'' with heavy inflows one week and none the next,
said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express
Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. ``That tells me that people are
a little uncertain. What every investor has been taught is to buy
the dips. It takes some time to disabuse them of the notion. But I
think it's slowly beginning to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few days of trading left in August, it is not yet clear
whether the universe of all equity funds will suffer net
withdrawals for the month, which has not happened in the mutual
fund industry since September 1990. Two data services that track
mutual fund cash flows on a weekly basis, AMG Data Services and
Trim Tabs Financial Services, report that U.S. equity funds have
taken in slightly more money than they paid out in August.
</P>
<P>
   But even those small inflows would be a dramatic decline from
the $19.3 billion that flowed into equity funds in July. According
to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, $145.5 billion
flowed into stock funds in the first seven months of the year,
nearly 8 percent more than in the same period last year and an
average of almost $21 billion per month.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees a negative sign in the recent slowdown in
purchases of equity funds. Charles Biderman, president of Trim Tabs
Financial Services, of Santa Rosa, Calif., said that individuals
have continued to invest nearly $4 billion per week. Instead of
going into stock funds this month, however, it has been temporarily
parked in money-market funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund managers have accumulated $30 billion in cash this month,
and individuals have put another $20 billion into money-market
funds,'' Biderman said. ``That means there's $50 billion on the
sidelines waiting for the market to stabilize,'' which he called a
bullish sign.
</P>
<P>
   Among the large mutual fund companies, only Vanguard offered
evidence of recent bullishness among equity investors. Based on
flows so far this month, Vanguard expects its stock funds will take
in about $1.7 billion in new money this month, roughly half of
July's total, according to Brian Mattes, a Vanguard principal.
Almost as much, about $1.6 billion, is expected to flow into money
market funds, which Attes said ``is certainly the highest amount in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a measure of caution being shown,'' he said.
``Investors are not making big exchanges out of equities, but money
that might have otherwise found its way into the equity market is
going into more conservative categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, investors were cashing in some of their stock
investments. At Fidelity Investments, the country's biggest fund
company, more than $1.8 billion flowed out of stock funds while
more than $4.5 billion flowed into money market funds, said Scott
Beyerl, a Fidelity spokesman. T. Rowe Price saw ``moderate net
outflows'' from its equity funds for the first time in five years,
said Steven Norwitz, a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And at Charles Schwab in San Francisco, which sells the mutual
funds of several hundred fund companies, nearly $1.9 billion fled
from equity funds, said spokesman Greg Gable. The last time that
withdrawals exceeded new deposits in stock funds sold through
Schwab's Mutual Fund marketplace was in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a kind of steady withdrawal from equity funds over
the past month, unlike in some of the past downturns where you get
a sharp decline and investors return right afterwards,'' Gable
said. He said individuals who invest directly in equities had
generally still been putting some new money into stocks, continuing
to buy after sharp market declines.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals from equity funds at some of the largest fund
companies might not be worrisome if they were restricted to
investors who use mutual funds to time the markets, quickly darting
in and out when they believe a sudden upward or downward move is
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   But a new measure of trading activity among investors in 401(k)
programs, devised by pension consultant Hewitt Associates, shows
that in the last month investors have been three times more likely
to shift money out of stocks and into the safer havens.
</P>
<P>
   The recently introduced Hewitt 401(k) Index tracks the daily
transfer activity of 1.4 million participants in large-company
401(k) plans with $62 billion in assets. On 17 of the the 23 days
that the financial markets were open from July 27 through
Wednesday, investors shifted money out of equity funds and into
fixed-income funds, according to Hewitt. That resulted in a net
shift of $484 million of those retirement plan assets out of stocks
over the past month.

FEN-PHEN RESEARCH RESULTS IN WARNING TO OTHER DRUG USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Researchers think they've discovered why the
discredited diet-drug combination called fen-phen apparently caused
heart-valve damage in some users _ and warn that other widely used
but unsuspected drug combinations may pose the same danger.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of patients on daily Prozac and related antidepressants
may be at risk, they said Thursday in interviews, if patients also
take the diet drug phentermine or possibly even over-the-counter
cold remedies such as Sudafed and the appetite suppressant
Accutrim.
</P>
<P>
   Many weight-loss clinics started prescribing Prozac and related
drugs along with phentermine, a combination popularly called
``phen-Pro,'' when the fen-phen regimen came under suspicion last
year as the cause of heart-valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers of Redux or dexfenfluoramine, the ``fen'' in
fen-phen, withdrew it from the market a year ago under pressure
from the US Food and Drug Administration. Phentermine, the other
half of the combination, remains on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The new data, to be presented in Paris next week at the
International Congress on Obesity, show that serotonin levels rose
in the blood of normal volunteers given two different doses of
phentermine. The reason, the researchers said, is that phentermine
blocks an enzyme called monoamine oxidase, or MAO, which is the
body's principal mechanism for clearing serotonin from the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Redux blocks the ability of blood cells called platelets to soak
up excess serotonin. So the combination apparently destroys some
patients' ability to control serotonin blood levels.
</P>
<P>
   Too much serotonin damages heart valves and blood vessels in the
lung, which can lead to a potentially fatal disorder known as
primary pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   ``If physicians had known that phentermine inhibits MAO, I
believe they never would have prescribed the two drugs together,''
said Timothy J. Maher of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy,
principal author of the new report.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston researchers said the FDA should determine if new
warnings or drug label changes are necessary, for phentermine and
for other MAO-blocking drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need some guidance from the FDA,'' said Richard J.
Wurtman, co-inventor of Redux and a coauthor of the new study along
with Ismail H. Ulus of the University of Uludag in Turkey. ``The
fact that phentermine is an MAO inhibitor should have been stated
on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   Wurtman pointed out that a number of drugs inhibit MAO. For
instance, the researchers called for study of pseudoephedrine in
the cold remedy Sudafed and the phenylpropanolamine found in
Accutrim. Maher said the herbs St. John's wort and ma huang, both
of which are taken for mood elevation and weight loss, may also
inhibit MAO.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Kushner, a weight-loss specialist at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, called it ``foolhardy'' to combine
phentermine with Prozac-like drugs without thorough studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding that phentermine is an MAO inhibitor is big news
with important public health implications,'' Kushner said.

PROSECUTOR CHALLENGES MOBSTER'S CLAIM OF FBI IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal prosecutor Thursday challenged the substance
_ and the very existence _ of gangster/informant Stephen Flemmi's
claim that the FBI gave him permission to commit any crime short of
murder, and accused him of concocting an agreement that he knew the
FBI and prosecutors would never endorse.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason why the alleged immunity deal, which Flemmi
claims former FBI supervisor John Morris agreed to in April 1985,
was never put in writing, Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr.
asserted Thursday while cross-examining Flemmi in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so absurd, that Mr. Morris would not or could not put
it in writing,'' Wyshak argued. ``Because no one in the FBI or in
the US attorney's office would ever go along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi said he didn't believe he needed a written contract. He
claimed that he was unaware at the time that the FBI documented its
dealings with top-level informants like him.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi insists his agreement with Morris was sealed during a
dinner meeting at Morris's Lexington home in April 1985. But, as
prosecutors have pointed out, that was more than two years after
Morris left the organized crime squad that oversaw Flemmi and his
criminal partner and fellow informant, James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a gentleman's agreement,'' said Flemmi. ``We shook
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claims that Morris gave him and Bulger permission to
commit any crime as long as they ``didn't clip anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Wyshak pressed Flemmi on whether that deal included,
for instance, rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's what he meant,'' Flemmi answered. ``He
knows I'm not a rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the agreement would permit him and Bulger to rob banks,
Flemmi replied, ``I would think anything short of murder I would be
protected for. I think it was my discretion. Basically all
organized crime matters, that's the way I understood it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyshak asked if truck hijacking was covered by the immunity
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it involved organized crime matters, it would be,'' Flemmi
said. The wide-ranging deal, he added, covered crimes ``past,
present and future.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, Bulger, New England Mafia boss Francis Salemme and
several others were indicted in 1995 on extortion and racketeering
charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a decades-long
joint criminal conspiracy between the Irish and Italian mobs.
Flemmi wants those charges dismissed because of his alleged
immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf is holding hearings, in part, to
determine whether Flemmi's immmunity claim is valid. In the absence
of any written agreement, Wolf must decide if Flemmi had an
``implied agreement'' with the FBI and, if so, whether it is
legally enforceable.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims there was no such agreement, and even if
there were it would be the result of FBI misconduct and therefore
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Flemmi claimed his FBI contacts, principally agent John
Connolly, his longtime handler, knew about his criminal activities.
But when prosecutors grilled him about specific crimes he'd
mentioned to the FBI, Flemmi invoked his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   When he wouldn't say whether he'd told Morris about shaking down
preeminent bookmaker/informant Burton ``Chico'' Krantz, Wyshak
asked Wolf to hold Flemmi in contempt of court. Wolf &UR;  &LR; declined, and
Flemmi conferred with his lawyer, Kenneth J. Fishman, then gave his
answer: No, he had never told Morris or Connolly about Krantz.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was the same when Flemmi was asked about shaking down
more than a dozen bookmakers and drug dealers.

 &HT;        CLINTON'S CASH COW: 90210
 &HT;    President's defense relies on Hollywood donors  
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 -- Call it the President's Hollywood
Lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Legal Expense Trust, the President's new legal
defense fund, has been buoyed by large contributions from Clinton's
high-powered Hollywood friends.
</P>
<P>
   California led the states in donations to the fund, with its
residents giving $423,000 -- more than 28 percent of the $1.5
million collected as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money -- $250,000 of it -- came from 25 donors who
maxed out on the fund's voluntary $10,000 limit. Those donors
include Clinton's traditional Hollywood supporters, such as Steven
Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, Barbra Streisand, David Geffen,
and Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, half of the money raised came from 97 donors who
gave more than $1,000, according to a States News Service analysis.
And none of that would have been possible under the President's
former legal defense fund, which limited donations to $1,000 per
individual.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the first defense fund folded in January, having
raised only $1.5 million over three-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   The new trust fund was founded in February by former Arkansas
Sen. David Pryor and five other trustees, shortly after the first
reports of an affair between the President and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21 -- four days after Clinton admitted having the
relationship -- the fund released its report showing $2.2 million
collected from about 17,000 individuals in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia, according to the trust.
</P>
<P>
   But the trust only released the list of donors that had given
before June 30 -- which is the portion of the list that has been
reviewed by their accountants. At that point, about 9,950 people
donated a total of $1.5 million to the embattled President.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the broad and ongoing support we have
seen for the President and the First Lady,'' said Pryor. ``We
believe that no First Family should face such a financial burden
while trying to carry out the work which the American people
elected the President to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust set a voluntary limit of $10,000 per individual donor,
and does not accept money from PACs, registered lobbyists,
corporations, labor unions or other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The higher limit allowed Clinton to cash in on the resources of
his Hollywood friends and other large donors. In all, 72 people
gave the maximum $10,000 contribution.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 100 donors making up half of the fund, the other
9,850 people averaged donations of about $150 each, according to
the computer analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The largest contingent of donors were retirees. Nearly 4,700 of
the 7,668 donors who listed their occupation -- about 61 percent --
said their occupation is ``retired'' or ``retiree.'' The retirees
added about $411,000, or about 27 percent, to the fund. About 2,300
donors did not list an occupation.
</P>
<P>
   To get contributors, the trust sent a solicitation letter to
people on lists of donors from the Clinton-Gore presidential
campaign and from the Democratic National Committee list, said
Peter Lavallee, administrator o the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The two-page letter begins, ``Dear Friend: In today's political
climate, public service can exact a disturbing price. There is,
perhaps, no better example than the financial crisis now facing
President and Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavallee said a ``surprizing number'' of people contacted the
fund on their own asking how they could help.

KENYAN HOSPITAL WORKERS PLAYED KEY ROLE IN EMBASSY BOMBING ARREST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although FBI Director Louis J. Freeh on Thursday
praised U.S. investigators for bringing a suspect in the Nairobi
embassy bombings to New York, court documents show that the big
break in the case may have come from alert Kenyan hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, the suspect, Mohamed Rashed Daoud
Al-`Owhali, and another unnamed suspect drove a vehicle loaded with
homemade bombs to the U.S. embassy in Nairobi on the morning of
Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle exploded, demolishing an adjacent secretarial
college and sending debris ripping through one of the Kenyan
capital's most congested streets. The blast killed 247 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   Another 10 people died in a nearly simultaneous explosion at the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In his confession to authorities, Al-`Owhali, also known as
Khalid Salim, said the bombing was intended to be a suicide mission
and that he expected to die in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-`Owhali survived, receiving only cuts and abrasions on
his face and hands and a large wound on his back from the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Following the blast, he was taken to a local hospital where he
was treated with other victims and later released.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the hospital, Al-`Owhali allegedly discarded in a
bathroom two keys that fit the padlock on the rear of the bombing
vehicle and three bullets for a gun he had left behind in the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital employees discovered the keys and bullets and alerted
Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Kenyan officials confronted Al-`Owhali and took
him into custody. On Aug. 12, he was turned over to the FBI. After
eight days of questioning, Al-`Owhali confessed to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In his confession, Al-`Owhali said he was trained in terrorist
camps in Afghanistan, including several camps affiliated with al
Qaeda, an international terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden.
Al-`Owhali, whose nationality is unknown, also admitted to
attending conferences and meeting with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials suspect bin Laden may have financed and planned
the two embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh praised the Kenyan authorities for their ``extraordinary
cooperation, assistance and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. authorities brought Al-`Owhali to New York
City where a U.S. magistrate will decide which U.S. court should
try him.
</P>
<P>
   A New York grand jury and the FBI field office there had been
investigating bin Laden's role in at least three terrorist attacks
or plots, officials said, including the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing, an aborted plot in New York to bomb bridges and tunnels
and a November 1995 car bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that
killed five Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint filed against Al-`Owhali, the bombing suspect
is charged with 12 counts of murder, one count of murder conspiracy
and one count of using weapons of mass destruction. If convicted on
all charges, Al-`Owhali would face a sentence of life in prison
without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in charge of New York City, Mary Jo White,
said the charges ``show this nation's commitment to track down and
prosecute all those who commit heinous, cowardly acts of
international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   A second bombing suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly
en route to New York. Odeh had been held by Kenyan authorities
since Aug. 14, a week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the
day of the bombing. Odeh is said to be either a Jordanian or
Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said other suspects are being investigated and also could
be sent here for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the embassy bombings, the United States last
week staged cruise missile strikes against targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan it said were linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try Al-`Owhali, and perhaps others, in this
country represented a swift resolution of a potential diplomatic
problem of whether Kenya or the United States would handle the
first prosecutions from the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the
hundreds of Kenyan victims but also wary that a trial there for an
attack on a U.S. target might invite new terrorist assaults on
Kenyan targets.

SYSTEMSOFT FOUNDER STEPPING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis that is affecting the electronics
industry in that region is generating big losses and a management
shake-up at SystemSoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick, Mass. firm reported Thursday a pretax loss of $6.3
million in the second quarter, compared to a $749,000 profit a year
earlier. Revenues plummeted to $2.6 million from $12.9 million in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the slump, SystemSoft founder and chairman Robert
Angelo is giving up his role as chief executive. That post will be
taken by former Cullinet Software vice president Frank Sola In
addition, Deborah Besemer, &UR;  &LR;  hired last December as president and
chief operating officer, has resigned from the firm. Bessemer
formerly headed worldwide field operations at Lotus Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   SystemSoft is also restructuring its operations. It will sell
its Japanese subsidiary to a Tokyo firm that is majority-owned by
Standard Microsystems Corp. of Hauppauge, N.Y. The company is also
licensing some of its software to a Taiwanese company which will
employ 45 SystemSoft workers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After the restructuring, the number of SystemSoft's employees
will shrink from 135 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   SystemSoft makes a variety of software products to improve the
performance of laptop and desktop computers. One of its key
products is software that is built into a special chip found on
computer motherboards. Most motherboards are made in Asian nations
being battered by that region's economic slump. As a result, said
SystemSoft vice president of marketing John Ambrose, motherboard
makers are sharply reducing production.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SystemSoft's line of software for connecting PC
card devices to laptops has largely been superseded by improvements
in Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   To recoup, SystemSoft is going to focus on its CardWizard
product line for Windows NT-based laptop computers, and on
SystemWizard, a program that automatically detects and repairs
problems with laptop and desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This simplified business strategy is the chief reason Besemer
is leaving the company, said Sola. ``Her skills are suited for a
large organization,'' he said. ``Right now we don't see the need
for a COO. The company is going to be smaller in size.''
</P>
<P>
   Sola said he would decide in the next 60 days whether the
company would replace Besemer. Efforts to reach Besemer by
telephone were unsuccessful.

   Diary of another day in the life:
</P>
<P>
   Out of bed. Legs working OK Not like when they were running the
quarter-mile in high school, but good enough to carry the whole
structure all the way to the pills. Took pills. Shaved. Thought
about presidents. Why everybody make such a big deal about
presidents. Showered. Franklin Pierce supposed to have been a
boozer. Got so snookered once that he rode his horse into a tree.
So they say. Whoever ``they'' are.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Edwards on NPR ``Morning Report.'' Terrific diction. Not
like Tom Brokaw. Tom really one swell guy, but swallows his
consonants. It's Tom who makes the big anchor bucks though. Not
Bob. Why anchors paid so much? Local anchors pulling down zillions
who couldn't cover a two-alarm fire. The teeth, I guess. Probably
go to Anchor University. Take Anchor 101: You will learn how to
smile and read teleprompter simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs. Open four doors. Blasts of wet heat. Gore may be
onto something with this global warming stuff. Remember Andre
Malraux's book about revolutionaries being thrown into locomotive
boilers? ``Man's Fate''? ``Man's Hope''? Read it too late in life
to remember it well. Something about Chinese Communists. Wait too
long to read a great book and you can't remember it the week after
you close it. ``The Leopard'' like that. Read it three years ago.
Great great novel. Now can't remember anything about it. Should
have read it in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Who'm I kidding? In high school read Street &AMP; Smith pulps, Spicy
Detective, Spicy Western, Spicy Whatever. Whatever it was, if it
was Spicy I read it. The obligatory Shakespeare too of course. Why
have high school on mind this morning? Maybe subconsciously
depressed by thought I'll never again run the quarter-mile in 50
seconds. And that's tortoise speed nowadays. Everybody now hyped up
on chemicals though. Cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Brought in morning paper. Clinton, Monica. Lord save us. ``Lord
Save Us With James C. Davis.'' Slogan of that congressman trying to
get some ink by running for president back in the 1950s. 1960s
maybe? Lord save us with Bill and Monica. From Bill and Monica?
Monica, oh Monica! Remember Groucho's song about tattooed lady.
``Lydia, oh Lydia, oh something, something _ Lydia the tattooed
lady!''
</P>
<P>
   Turned on TV. Weather Channel. Yes, once again we will have some
weather today. Already having some out there in northern Indiana,
poor devils trying to drive to work through those storms. Switched
to C-Span. People phoning from all over about Bill, Monica. Monica,
oh Monica! Oh have you seen Monica?
</P>
<P>
   Switched to old-movie channel. John Payne _ John Payne! _
singing ``I'm Always Chasing Rainbows.'' Not at this hour, John.
Switched to other old-movie channel. The Warner Oland Charlie Chan.
Charlie never the same after Sidney Toler took over from Oland.
Toler lacked unction. Switched to CNN. Hurricane, Bill and Monica _
oh have you seen Monica? _ Orrin Hatch. Never thought there'd come
a time when Orrin Hatch was the only man in Washington who looked
presidential.
</P>
<P>
   Squelched TV. Read comics, obits, sports. Has a baseball season
ever been duller? Yankees sewed up pennant by Mother's Day.
McGwire, Sosa, Griffey hit homers galore but their teams lose
anyhow. Everything is exhibition, not competition. Remember when
Ted Williams managed the senators? Finished in first division that
year. Only first-division finish for Senators since the Franklin
Pierce administration.
</P>
<P>
   Finished breakfast, felt rotten about not reading in Gibbon's
``Decline and Fall'' for past three months. Never finish at this
rate. Not with old Alzheimer waiting to pounce. Still, have to
finish Dickens' ``Our Mutual Friend'' _ 800 pages _ plus Robert
Creamer's Babe Ruth bio, plus something by St. Thomas Aquinas.
Aquinas provides moral insight. My next Bill-Monica column needs
it. Recent Bill-Monica columns very flabby. ``No substance, no
urgency, no moral insight, no edge,'' says editor.
</P>
<P>
   Got to have edge these days. Miles and miles and miles of edge.
Probably get away with cribbing Aquinas word for word. Newsroom
types never read him anymore. Careful, though. Can't even
plagiarize your wife's wisecracks these days without some editor
demanding your resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, impossible to stay awake reading Aquinas. Not spicy
enough? Why not take a nap first? Then tackle Aquinas after waking
up refreshed? Good thinking ...

COMMENTARY: SCOTT RITTER'S DECISION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In seven years as a key U.N. inspector searching out Saddam
Hussein's concealed capabilities to make weapons of mass
destruction, Scott Ritter had to call on all the physical courage
in him. Then on Wednesday he summoned up all his moral and
intellectual courage, and resigned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his letter of resignation and in conversation, he gave the
world his reasons, with candor we have almost forgotten. He said
the U.S. administration, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
U.N. Security Council were seriously weakening the inspection
machinery, the only thing that stood between Saddam Hussein and
revival of Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapon programs.
Scott Ritter _ William S. only to official records _ has performed
what he considered inescapable duties: refusal to participate in
the damage to inspection, letting the world know arms control in
Iraq was an ``illusion, more dangerous than no arms control at
all.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Straight out, he said that the United States had blocked
additional personnel and equipment needed to carry out critical
spot inspections, that the secretary-general had made himself
simply a sounding board for Saddam's grievances, that the United
States and United Nations once again had exacted no penalty from
Saddam for ordering U.N. inspections ended. Iraq, said Ritter, is
now stronger than when the United States and United Nations allowed
Saddam to walk away from the Gulf war and took on the job of
controlling Iraqi power.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Washington and the United Nations, denials and knifings of
Ritter came as soon as it was known that he had taken on the U.N.
bureaucracy and the American government he once served as a Marine
intelligence officer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Americans leave it at that _ he says, they deny _ Ritter's
bravery may not bring results. So it is important for Americans to
know the denials and knifing do not come from everybody in
Washington or the United Nations, not from the insistently
honorable.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's top aides, by acting as if they had
believed him not only about Monica Lewinsky but about far more
important reversals, have lowered confidence in themselves, almost
to invisibility. I have in mind the apologists of his reversal on
human rights, on the relative ranking in American foreign policy of
democracy and foreign trade, the bailing out of corrupt foreign
despotisms, his furious fight against monitoring religious
persecution abroad, that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton's people tell us to believe that his war against
terrorism can consist of missiles against terrorist gangs in
Afghanistan and the Sudan _ while Iraq, a major terrorist state, is
getting immunity for closing down U.N. inspections. Secretary of
State Albright says that's a matter between the United Nations and
Iraq.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With such judgments, and with a president who has to think
politically, whether about Monica or Saddam, Americans should
search for other minds to trust.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I trust the people at the United Nations and in Washington who
tell me that Ritter was telling the truth. Bolstering them is the
evidence of American journalists, who even before the Ritter
resignation were documenting U.S. diplomacy against surprise
inspections that might upset Saddam and our allies who want his
business back.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But why would the United States damage inspection of Iraq?
Ritter, and I, do not believe that the president &AMP; co. have fallen
in love with Saddam. But from what clues the administration grants
the public, the idea seems to be that Iraq can be so weakened in
pocketbook that Iraqis will get real mad and somebody will kill
him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ritter points out that the United Nations already grants Iraq
more oil to sell than Iraq can pump. He says that soon the United
Nations will allow Iraq the funds to build more pumps. Sounds
crazy, is crazy. Resignations, anyone?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Ritter really wants, I come to understand, is for America to
be what he thought it was _ not bloodthirsty against Iraq but
staunch, determined to prevent Saddam from killing us and other
enemies, in mass.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hope someday his twin 5-year-old girls read this job
assessment of their father:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brave in service against state terrorism, even braver in
resigning to speak truths, and admirable in the faith that his
countrymen will recognize awaiting dangers, if told by those who
know.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all that is the mark of an innocent, send in more.
</P>

<P>
   HITRA ISLAND, Norway _ Norwegians have long looked out on their
deep fjords, snow-crested peaks and scatterings of scrub-covered
islands as soaring symbols of their wilderness culture.
</P>
<P>
   But shown that scene today, they are more likely to wonder how
they can scale over it, bore through it or burrow under it.
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking scenery that inspired Grieg's symphonies,
Munch's paintings and Ibsen's plays and poetry is now in thrall to
the creative instincts of Norway's plucky bridge and tunnel
builders.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from North Sea oil, Norway is connecting its sparsely
inhabited outcroppings and linking its interior fjordside villages
clinging to sheer rock faces in a desperate effort to stanch the
flow of people to towns and cities from the breathtaking wild that
inspired Norwegians' view of themselves as pastoral dwellers of one
of the world's most majestic countrysides.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Norway is constructing some of the world's most
ambitious transportation projects in some of the world's most
remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   On this largely barren island off Norway's meandering west coast
there is a new 3.5-mile-long, three-lane underwater tunnel that is
the world's deepest and second longest. Built at a cost of $41
million, it links the mainland to a place that has just 4,100
inhabitants. Work has already started on a $69 million tunnel from
this island to its even smaller neighbor, Froya. Only 4,000 people
live there.
</P>
<P>
   On the North Cape at Norway's Arctic tip, construction is under
way on a $140 million bridge and tunnel project to Mager Island,
home to 3,600 people and almost as many reindeer. An additional
$135 million is going into the earth in the mountains east of
Bergen to link the towns of Aurland (population 1,900) and Laerdal
(2,250). Its 15.2-mile length will cast the current world
record-holder, the 10.1-mile-long St. Gotthard tunnel in
Switzerland, into distant second place.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,800 miles of rail, road and hydroelectric power tunnels
snaking their way under fjord and mountain, Norwegians are able and
practiced underground.
</P>
<P>
   The projects stand up to cost analysis only when you factor in
Norway's passion for portraying itself as a nation of
self-sufficient rustics. There is a deep Norwegian desire to
celebrate the country's rural heritage, and one consequence of that
is a public policy intended to provide the infrastructure to
outlying areas so that people will stay there and not retreat to
towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kjell Erik Vindtorn, a contemporary poet, once said, ``Inside
every Norwegian there lies buried a vast mountain range,'' and that
notion is the inspiration in Oslo, the capital city, of the
development strategy known as the ``District Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First there is our traditions and our culture,'' said Ranghild
Queseth Haarstad, the minister of local government and regional
development. ``Then there is the fact that our most important
export articles _ oil, fish, lumber and tourism _ are in those
districts. If we're going to exploit them, we have to have people
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the incentives provided to the north and the west coast by
the national government are unconditional per-inhabitant grants to
local governments, exemptions from payroll taxes for local
businesses, increased child-benefit payments, and investment and
operating subsidies to start-up enterprises. One northern town is
reported to have offered $3,300 to any woman who would marry a
local man.
</P>
<P>
   The 165-member national assembly known as the Storting is
heavily weighted toward rural interests and has little sympathy for
complaints from urban legislators that their projects, benefiting
many more people, are being cheated to finance provincial
undertakings. The Granfoss Tunnel in Oslo, which cannot get money
for urgently needed repairs, handles 23,000 cars a day, 100 times
more than the new North Cape tunnel, through which only 230
vehicles will pass daily.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Aftenposten newspaper last month tracking
migration patterns showed that 23 percent of those asked would
prefer to live in cities of at least 100,000 people, a figure that
was disproportionately representative of young people and up from 8
percent in a similar survey in 1992. An additional 25 percent said
they preferred small-town life to rural life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haarstad acknowledged that the District Policy was not
keeping everyone from leaving and that flight to the towns and
cities continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, `` she added, ``we can wonder how bad it would be if we
hadn't done these measures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a broad political agreement in Norway that we should
preserve our traditional population patterns,'' Ms. Haarstad said.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in her bleached wood, brightly lit high-rise office,
she emphasized that her own roots were in a small town in the east
and that she left Oslo whenever she could for one of her two cabins
in the countryside, neither with running water.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of claim exasperates Thomas Hylland Eriksen, an
anthropologist at the University of Oslo. ``Norwegians will tell
you they long to go off to a cabin that is cold, dark and
uncomfortable and has no electricity and is as far away from the
road as possible so you have to carry your things a great
distance,'' he said. ``In fact, these places in the countryside can
be very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 satirical pamphlet called ``How to Understand and Use
a Norwegian,'' the humorist Odd Borretzen wrote, ``Because the
Norwegian is, after all, a son of the Wilderness, who lives a
simple life in harmony with Natur, he has concealed the telephone
in a rustic bookcase, hidden the telefax in a rose-painted wooden
chest with iron bands, and covered the electric oven with
pebbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen argued that the myth was losing its force because the
country's identity was changing. ``Norway was built as a nation on
images of countryside and nature,'' he said. ``It worked very well
in the 1850s when that's all we had. But people now like what can
be found in cities, a little cultural life, the cinema, cafes,
shops. They like feeling part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Norwegians call the string of boat connections and
winding inland roads that wrap around the fingers of water that
make their shoreline so serpentine ``Highway One.'' Ask anyone
living on the hundreds of islands that dot the coastline what
bothers him the most, and he'll tell you it's waiting for the next
boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to travel a lot, and we get very stressed looking at
our watches and remembering when the ferry leaves,'' said Ole
Haugen, manager of a salmon farm on Hitra. ``Norwegians like to
feel free, and today, thanks to the tunnel, we feel free, 24 hours
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Egil Hestnes, Hitra's mayor, said the only people who had
objected to the tunnel here were the ferryboat owners and
``romantics.'' He classed the latter as ``outsiders who came here
because they wanted to live on an island.''
</P>
<P>
   While welcoming the tunnel, some of this windswept island's
shepherds, fishermen, crabbers and sailors needed help in coming to
emotional terms with it. A professor from the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine at the University of Trondheim
had to run 18 local residents through two days of therapy before
they could overcome their claustrophobia and be coaxed into their
grand new installation.
</P>
<P>
   The descent into the Hitra Tunnel is so steep that drivers are
encouraged to take it in lower gears. At its bottom, 870 feet below
sea level, the moisture often condenses, setting off ceiling fans
that blow dense fog into the kinds of billows opera directors
conjure to announce the arrival on stage of Wagnerian antiheroes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no danger of being delayed by traffic: the tunnel
handles an average of only 25 cars an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this Arcadian building boom, Eriksen said: ``You
know the joke about that, don't you? If the bridge is built for six
families who live on an island, all six use it once to pack up
their things and move off the island.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Norwegians it is no joking matter. In a newspaper
article typical of the kind frequently published these days, the
Aftenposten ran an article on Else Steffensen, who at 83 found
herself the last inhabitant of a western island that once supported
nine farms and 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it must have looked after the Black Death,'' the
article read, ``cultivated earth that the forest is slowly
reconquering, uninhabited, partly collapsed houses, no people, no
animals.'' It concluded, ``You can see it almost everywhere in
Norway's outer reaches.''

Yeltsin Thursday to cede some of his powers or even step aside as
Russia's political leaders frantically negotiated over fundamental
changes in the country's economic policies. His political opponents
pushed for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of

Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the
fall of the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between
the remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from
the ashes of socialism. Chernomyrdin has sent unmistakable signals
that he wants to form a coalition government that embraces tycoons
and Communists alike. But the final outcome of that effort to
reconcile such opposing forces is by no means clear, and the
politics of Chernomyrdin's coalition-building is at odds with the

tonight that it intends to nationalize SBS-Agro Bank, by most

   RUSSIA-EUROPE (Paris) _ With the monetary crisis in Russia
creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in
European capitals Thursday that the crisis could throttle economic
growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to
democracy. But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight
of his life for re-election a month from now and with President
Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened
political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive
action during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting planned for next week

central bank intervened to shore up confidence in its currency, the

   MARKET-INVESTORS (New York) _ Individual investors, whose
determination to buy stocks whenever the market takes a tumble has
been the bulwark of the bull market of the 1990s, appear to be
weakening under the weight of a month-long decline in equity
prices. In recent weeks, individuals have been pouring more of
their new cash into the safe haven of money-market funds than into
any other investment category, while at the same time many of them
have been pulling money out of stocks. So far, August appears to be
the weakest month for new purchases of equity mutual funds in
several years. By Edward Wyatt.

BONNIE CHURNS NORTHWARD IN WEAKENED STATE

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ After a 36-hour deluge, Hurricane Bonnie
slackened to a tropical depression Thursday and churned back toward
the sea, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power
but generally relieved by the limited destruction.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared North Carolina a disaster area after
the hurricane smashed across Cape Fear, the state's southernmost
point, and strafed much of the coast with 12 inches of gale-driven
rain before losing its punch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  By the time Bonnie reached the state's delicate Outer Banks
Thursday, the storm's top winds had weakend from 115 mph to barely
65 mph, too slow to wreck much property yet still strong enough
that reporters had to shout into microphones from their beachfront
perches.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane left uncounted millions of dollars in damages in
its wake. But the destruction paled in comparison with the
multibillion-dollar ruin caused by previous hurricanes, most
recently Fran, which also made landfall at Cape Fear, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our lights, but, thank the Lord, we didn't lose our
lives,'' said Corinne Wilson, 37, as she waited with her three
children for cold sandwiches at a Salvation Army truck in
Wilmington. The city of 95,000, just north of Cape Fear, absorbed
the brunt of Bonnie's rage.
</P>
<P>
   The storm is expected to leave North Carolina and return to sea,
where, forecasters said, it will regain power as it lurches
northeast and skirts south of Cape Cod Friday night or early
Saturday. Meterologists said the storm could return to hurricane
strength over the ocean, and tropical storm advisories were issued
for coastal communities as far north as Watch Hill, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of Bonnie's punishing New England as severely as
it pummeled North Carolina were considered slim. Although North
Carolina escaped catastrophe _ no one was killed and no major
structure was destroyed _ a long stretch of coastline bore the
scars of a serious storm beating.
</P>
<P>
   Floodwaters surged through many communities, washing away cars
and kitchen appliances, and generally vindicating government orders
to evacuate more than 500,000 people from coastal regions in North
Carolina and South Carolina as the 450-mile-wide hurricane
approached.
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville, N.C., where the storm forced the Marine Corps
to halt normal operations at sprawling Camp Lejeune, rescuers
pulled two men to safety after they abandoned their car in
floodwaters and clung to a pole.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie unleashed 12 inches of rain on Jacksonville in less than
36 hours. With an inch of rain the equivalent of a foot of snow,
the downfall was comparable to 12 feet snow falling in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, motor boats replaced motor vehicles on many roads.
And the entire downtown section of Washington, a small community on
the banks of the Pamlico River, was under water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a hurricane stay on and just continue to
batter an area like this hurricane has,'' North Carolina Governor
Jim Hunt said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt activated 800 national guardsmen and put 500 more on
standby. More than 2,000 prison inmates also were poised to help
with the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the cleanup got under way, there was the distant
threat of Hurricane Danielle, which is about 300 miles northwest of
the northern Leeward Islands. Forecasters said it was too early to
tell whether Danielle would hit the US mainland.
</P>
<P>
   For now, cleanup crews have work aplenty all along the coast,
from Calabash, near the border with South Carolina, to Atlantic
Beach, a short commute from the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the torrential rain subsided and insurance claims agents went
to work, many streets that were not under water were receptacles
for toppled trees, utility poles and windblown debris. In some
areas, so many pine boughs and needles filled the streets that they
smelled like Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   Roofs were ripped off many buildings, siding and shingles off
others. Mobile homes were uprooted. And scores of street signs were
twisted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,000 people remained in shelters. Mandatory
evacuation orders remained in effect for many barrier islands, and
curfews were still in place in many other coastal communities where
power was not expected to be fully restored until next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Carolinas, more than 400,000 people were still without
power. Hardest hit was Wilmington, where 90 percent of the homes
and businesses remained without electricity. But even as utility
crews from several states converged on the area, residents
expressed relief at their relatively minor misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death when Bonnie got close,'' said Kate
Parker, 70, as she sat on her front porch, waiting for power to be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Fran struck two years ago, every large tree on
Parker's property toppled, including a mammoth oak that crushed a
home across the street while a family slept inside. The oak is
gone, but the destroyed home sits unoccupied, a powerful reminder
of Fran's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so afraid it was going to happen all over again,''
Parker said. ``But this storm was not as intense. It just took
longer to leave.''

CLINTON SUPPORTERS TURN OUT TO CHEER THEIR MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ John Yarosh supported President Clinton in
1992, and as he stood outside Worcester Regional Airport waiting
for the president's plane to arrive, he said he remains an ardent
fan - just a more self-conscious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love his policies. I really do think he has great
ideas,'' said Yarosh, a student at the Rhode Island School of
Design, as he cradled his daughter in his arms. ``But now I don't
wear my Clinton T-shirt too much. It's a little embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Yarosh, many of the thousands who came out to greet the
president Thursday said they were disappointed by his affair with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky but believe strongly in his
public policies and still support him. And because of the battering
he's taken in the media, they said, they wanted to let him know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason I'm here -- to show him I'm still with
him. That a man can have an affair and still do his job. That is a
private issue to me,'' said Boni Hycner, a college student who
lives in nearby Charlton.
</P>
<P>
   In making Worcester the first stop in the rebuilding of
President Clinton's public image, his political advisers seem to
have chosen well.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of protestors carryied signs saying, ``Liar,'' and
``Resign,'' and two men dressed up in wig and costume impersonating
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and Monica Lewinsky, complete
with blue dress. But overall, the crowd appeared overwhelmingly
sympathetic. Just the sight of the president's back in the distance
elicited screams from some of several hundred people assembled at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 10-deep in some places along his motorcade route, this
old-fashioned city delivered an old-fashioned welcome. ``We Love
You Still, Bill and Hill,'' read one sign. ``We The Irish Love You
Mr. President,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. James McGovern, who invited Clinton to Worcester
months ago, said he was surprised by the size and emotion of the
crowd, having been nervous about the president's reception.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It was almost as if people were going out of their way to
say, `We're with you,' That's what they were saying, those that
came up and spoke to him,'' McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was so uplifted by the crowds that he stayed five hours
rather than the one hour that was planned, McGovern said. Clinton
joined McGovern, Senators John Kerry and Ted Kennedy, Worcester
Mayor Raymond Mariano and others for lunch at Scano's Bakery, a
local hangout.
</P>
<P>
   When they emerged over an hour later -- Clinton having consumed
the bakery's special of Steak Bomb, cannoli and a Diet Coke _ a
huge crowd had gathered and again lined the route to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   If Worcester wanted to boost the president's spirits, it
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying, `This is great, this is great,''' said
McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Not since President Lyndon Johnson spoke at the Holy Cross
commencement in the 1960s has a president stopped in this city, and
hundreds who held tickets to Clinton's speech had to be turned
away.
</P>
<P>
   As police looked on anxiously, a stream of people loudly debated
the handful of protestors marooned on a corner, a street away from
Mechanics Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind politics, the president is human. He made
mistakes,'' Bobby Harris, one of Worcester's best known
professional boxers, told the man impersonating Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever made a mistake? I have. Everyone has a closet
and no one would be happy to have it opened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr impersonator, who identified himself as Tom Fuller of
Nashua, N.H., argued that the president should be held to a higher
standard. ``Are you saying you would cheat on your wife?'' he
prodded Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't. But if I did, it's my problem and my wife's
problem. You guys go home,'' Harris responded.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, people seemed somewhat comforted, even as they were
embarrassed, by the president's fallibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I put myself in the same situation and a little cutie comes
up, I could be tempted too,'' said Seymour Solomon of Worcester, a
dermatologist. ``I don't know if I'd do it in the Oval Office,
though. But I'm a middle aged man, too. I understand.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a brief but wild ride for Russia's cowboy
banking empires, and like the economy on which they were saddled,
it looks to be meeting a disastrous end.
</P>
<P>
   Capping two weeks of increasingly alarmist rumors, the Russian
government said Thursday night that it intends to nationalize
SBS-Agro Bank, by most measures the country's third-largest. Within
minutes, five more major banks announced plans to merge. In two
days, 10 of the country's 15 biggest banks have either combined,
folded or been earmarked for government takeover. They will not be
the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian banking system is insolvent, the victim of bad
management, very bad bets on the stability of the ruble and
execrable investments in near-worthless government bonds. By one
estimate, the combined balance sheets of the 15 biggest banks are
at least $4 billion in the hole, a figure that leaps every day the
Russian ruble continues to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 1,600 or so banks, mostly so small as to be
insignificant, are being dragged along in the fiscal undertow. Many
will not be missed, for Russian banks are not banks as westerners
know them. Some are money-launderers; some currency speculators;
some investment houses or pension funds or insurance companies or
conduits to offshore subsidiaries. The biggest are cash drawers for
vast conglomerates, moving money among their component companies. A
very few served average families and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question now is what to do with them next. On a
purely rubles-and-kopecks basis, the solution is pretty clear:
``Under normal market conditions, banks would fail,'' said Alex
Kotcherguine, the bank credit specialist for Russia and Eastern
Europe for Paribas European Investment in London. ``But there are
no normal market conditions in Russia, as we have all learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is already an open struggle over whether to let
the banks die or use the country's dwindling resources to keep them
on life support. Neither alternative is pleasant: one wipes out up
to 80 percent of all banks, with unknown effects on their creditors
and customers.
</P>
<P>
   The other would require printing more money to shore up sickly
banks and their wealthy owners _ and that would threaten to
re-ignite inflation. Russia's ousted economic reformers, along with
the western investors who stand to lose billions from a total
collapse of the system, want the government to shut down the
sickest banks and focus its rescue on the few worth saving. So, it
is said, do some banks controlled by industrial behemoths _
so-called oligarchs _ whose businesses benefit from foreign trade
and western credit, such as oil exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the sickest banks, controlled by other oligarchs,
are dead set against that. The board of SBS-Agro said Thursday
night that it had been blindsided by the government's takeover plan
and demanded that the Kremlin pay ``hundreds of millions of
dollars'' in obligations, presumably in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The newly designated prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, may be
somewhere in the middle. A draft economic program approved by his
supporters in the Russian Duma Thursday called for increased
protection of banks and depositors, but offered no specifics beyond
a denial that the proposals were radical.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has shut only one of the top 15 banks,
Imperial Bank, which had defaulted earlier on a $50 million foreign
loan and was closed Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In terms of global finance, this battle seems at first to be
almost piddling. The combined assets of all Russian banks as
figured by the Central Bank last January totalled a mere $100
billion _ less than the ninth-largest bank in America, First
Chicago NBD Corp. Russia's largest bank, state-controlled Sberbank,
is only about as big as Summit Bancorp, the 28th-largest U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the banks have deep roots in the economy. Few Russians
trust much of their money to them _ proportionately, household
deposits are 6 to 10 times smaller than in many western countries _
and the vast bulk of savings are in a single bank, Sberbank, which
almost certainly will not be allowed to fail. One motive behind the
string of mergers, some analysts say, is for weak banks to ally
themselves with the few banks that serve households and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is that the government will nurse those banks
first and terminate others _ such as Imperial _ whose failures will
not drain the wallets of ordinary workers. But assets and deposits
are not what count most in the current crisis. The banks matter in
part because they fed the government's appetite for easy credit
over the last five years, when deficits were mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's biggest banks established industrial empires _
and close ties to politicians _ by lending the government money,
then accepting shares of state-owned companies in lieu of payment
on the loans. The business of financing government activities at
ever-growing interest rates became a staple of bank business and
provided capital for other, riskier ventures such as currency
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia declared a temporary halt to paying off its bond
debt on August 17, Russian banks held 105 billion rubles in
short-term bonds _ then about $17 billion _ at interest rates as
high as 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' size also masks their importance to the economy.
Except for the big state- and city-owned banks, many large Russian
banks are the financial string that ties together the business
conglomerates of the oligarchs and other financiers. Not only do
the banks manage their finances and supply them with loans _ often
at sweetheart rates _ but it is commonly believed that they move
money in and out of Russia for tax and investment purposes.
</P>
<P>
   And a huge amount of money has fled Russia _ according to Credit
Suisse-First Boston, at least $66 billion from 1994 to 1997 alone.
Cyprus, the best-known offshore tax haven, is home to at least
2,000 subsidiaries of Russian companies, according to Steven
Shevoley, a Thomson Bankwatch vice president who watches Russian
banks from the island. Had that money remained in the country, it
would have spurred domestic investment and reduced the government's
need for deficit spending, one root of its current woes.

   MARKET-INVESTORS (New York) _ Individual investors, whose
determination to buy stocks whenever the market takes a tumble has
been the bulwark of the bull market of the 1990s, appear to be
weakening under the weight of a month-long decline in equity
prices. In recent weeks, individuals have been pouring more of
their new cash into the safe haven of money-market funds than into
any other investment category, while at the same time many of them
have been pulling money out of stocks. By Edward Wyatt.

   BLACKBALLING (Undated) _ Several years ago, skeptical about CUC
International's profitability and surprised at gaps in its reports
to shareholders, Robert Renck Jr., a Wall Street securities
analyst, advised investors to sell CUC shares. CUC's top executives
retaliated. They blackballed Renck, he says, refusing to return his

Wall Street was stunned to learn that extensive ``accounting
irregularities'' had been uncovered at CUC, which by then had
merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant Corp. By Diana B. Henriques.

EMBARRASSED, ANGRY, FORGIVING ... WOMEN SPEAK OUT ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-SPEECH) 
(JT) 
 By JANNY SCOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something startling about the vocabulary that women who
have supported President Clinton now use in conversations about
him: phrases like skirt chaser and laughingstock, nouns like idiot
and jerk, adjectives like feckless, sleazy, self-indulgent, gross.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally striking that so many of the same women want
Clinton to remain in office. They say he has been a friend to
women. Even now, they could imagine voting for him again, if he
were able to run.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews in which women across the country were
asked how they felt about Clinton in light of the details of his
sexual entanglement with Monica Lewinsky, many struggled to
reconcile the person they had believed he was with the disturbing
details of what they now know he did.
</P>
<P>
   That is, how to reconcile the man who appointed Ruth Bader
Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court and named the first female
attorney general and secretary of state with the man who was caught
philandering in the White House with an intern who saved a
semen-stained dress?
</P>
<P>
   The reconciliation is not coming easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised by how profoundly this has shaken me,''
said Nell Minow, a shareholder activist and mother of two from
McLean, Va. ``On behalf of the 24-year-old girl that I used to be
and the 46-year-old wife that I am now, I feel very shaken and
betrayed on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes soap opera broadcast live from Washington has
touched deep-rooted feelings not only about Clinton but about a set
of issues many women know well _ the marital infidelity of
middle-aged men, the degree of responsibility of younger women, the
appropriate reaction of a wife.
</P>
<P>
   It has become what Ms. Minow called ``one of the rare,
Rorschach-test moments that come along that really define a lot of
inner conflicts'' _ just as the O.J. Simpson case seemed to define
where people stood on race issues and the Anita Hill case did on
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, women seemed simultaneously to reveal feelings
about politics and marriage, about wayward presidents and husbands:
They were appalled, they were embarrassed, they wished they did not
know; they wanted him to stay, they wanted him out; they were
disappointed: How could he be so stupid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's gross,'' said Anne Bernays, a 67-year-old
novelist in Cambridge, Mass. ``And sleazy and self-indulgent and
risky, above all risky,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Many had little sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky. They called her a
groupie, silly and star-struck, in way over her head. Others saw
her as a victim. As for Hillary Rodham Clinton, some admired her
outward composure over the past two weeks, while a few wished she
would just get mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respected Hillary enormously _ up until yesterday,''
said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, an author and a founding editor of Ms.
magazine, the day after the Clinton family departed on vacation,
holding hands. ``It was the hand holding, the `We love each other.'
'' Ms. Pogrebin, 59, said she wished Mrs. Clinton would get angry.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the women interviewed had voted for Clinton in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his first presidential campaign, women have strongly
supported Clinton. In the 1996 election, the gender gap among
Clinton voters was 11 points. In public opinion polls, women have
consistently given Clinton slightly higher job approval ratings
than have men.
</P>
<P>
   But in a televised address on Aug. 17, he admitted for the first
time that he had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Testifying in the grand jury investigation of the matter
earlier that day, he acknowledged that they had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, however, is said to have described the
relationship differently in her own grand jury testimony, several
sexual encounters in a private study down a short hallway from the
Oval Office. She is said to have testified that Clinton also
caressed her breasts and genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was sexual contact between a married president
and a subordinate not much older than his daughter. To many women,
terms like ``romance'' do not quite fit. Some described Clinton's
behavior as sadly pathological; others used terms like ``tawdry''
and ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no greater expression of power?'' asked Catharine
Stimpson, dean of the graduate school of arts and science at New
York University, reflecting on Clinton's arrangement with Ms.
Lewinsky. ``Is that not aristocratic? It's like eating without ever
doing the cooking or the shopping.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many women said they were not surprised. They had suspected as
much since the story first broke. And, as many Americans have said
all along, they said they consider the matter none of their
business and wish it would go away.
</P>
<P>
   Some said sex should not be used to measure morality or
immorality; nor should lying about sex, which they take to be
commonplace. They said they judge their presidents by other
standards, and, by those standards, Clinton had measured up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kind of tacky behavior,'' said Ms. Bernays. ``Also,
I think it's _ I love this word _ feckless. That he obliged loyal
people like Betty Currie to have to defend themselves and pay
enormous lawyers' bills, just because he can't keep his pants
zipped _ that's feckless.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Bogin Cohen, 61, a volunteer from Boston, said she had
figured all along that Clinton was a man of ``unrestrained
appetites and poor judgment.'' She said she had voted for him
anyway, believing he was better than the alternatives, and that she
could imagine doing so again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of things are gray in life,'' Ms. Cohen said. ``I think
his actions are deplorable and I don't really forgive him and I
think he did damage to the presidency. But I wouldn't not vote for
him if I thought he were the best person for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were stunned to find themselves so upset. For years, they
had given Clinton the benefit of the doubt. They had done their
best to overlook the unsettling details leaking out over the last
seven months. But finally, the details had become impossible to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow, who recalled licking envelopes and distributing
flyers for Clinton, said she felt betrayed on behalf of the young
woman in her first job who she once was. Recalling the
vulnerability of that position, she said she was appalled by anyone
who might exploit a woman at that point in her life.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also felt betrayed as a wife whenever any
``middle-aged man opts for the smooth skin and the adoring gaze.''
Finally, as a former Clinton volunteer, she said she felt betrayed
``that he would risk everything I thought we both cared about for
something so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I don't know what would upset me more: if he cared
about her or if he didn't. I assume he didn't. This is not the
Wallis Simpson of America. It seems like such a tawdry,
exploitative, stupid relationship. And it's hard to reconcile that
with Mister-I-Feel-Your-Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Lewinsky, Joan Smith, 50, who owns a hair salon in
Middletown, Conn., dismissed her as an opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Daniloff, a 35-year-old university public relations
executive in Cambridge, Mass., said she figured Ms. Lewinsky had
embarked upon the relationship willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a child at all,'' said Susan Becker, a former
costume designer who is now a producer in Los Angeles. ``It's not
like `I had no idea this man was married!' Let's be honest. It
would seem that she had an agenda. So I don't really have any
sympathies in that department.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, it was almost immaterial whether she was a consenting
adult, because she was in a situation in which consent was
complicated by the extreme imbalance of power between the people
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset, I thought, `Hey, 21, that's plenty old enough
to consent,''' said Miriam Horn, 40, a writer in Manhattan who is
working a book on Mrs. Clinton's Wellesley College classmates.
``Thinking back to my own 21-year-old-ness, I guess that feeling
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think he's completely responsible, almost no
matter what she did,'' she said. ``The gap is so unfathomable
between a 21-year-old intern and a man more than twice her age who
is not only the president but a man of famous charisma. I think his
obligation to exercise restraint is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   There were similarly split feelings about Mrs. Clinton's
handling of the matter, including the sentiments expressed in a
statement after Clinton's speech, in which a spokeswoman stated
that Mrs. Clinton loved and forgave him, was committed to their
marriage and was relying on her religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Hillary,'' said Ms. Cohen of Boston, thinking back on the
day of Clinton's televised admission. ``I mean, yes, he got her to
the White House. But what a terrible day she had. And even if she
knew it _ and I'm sure she knew it _ she has to eat crow in public
because of this jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pogrebin, who said she has raised money and campaigned for
Clinton since 1991, said she now wants him to resign. ``He has lost
his political usefulness,'' she said. But most of the women
interviewed said they still wanted him as president, despite
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, in this reactionary climate, Clinton passes for something
like a bulwark for certain civil liberties and principles that
women believe in,'' said Ann Douglas, an English professor at
Columbia University. To continue to support him, even now, is
completely defensible, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that means I'm a grown-up,'' said Douglas, who said
she voted for the Green Party candidate in the last presidential
election. ``Politics are interest politics. I have my interests. I
will think twice about demolishing someone who has worked,
comparatively speaking, to protect the things I care about.''

SOME MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS SEEKING SAFER HAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When not analyzing the fickle buying habits of grocery shoppers,
Michael P. Manix is counting the money in his three stock mutual
funds. While convinced his investments will bear fruit over time,
Manix has blanched at Wall Street's rollercoaster volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in this for the long haul, and I'm sitting tight,'' said
30-year-old Manix, a financial analyst for Star Markets Co. in
Waltham. ``But if I had a new, big sum of cash right now, I'd park
it a money market fund for a couple of months until everything
calmed down _ if it did calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   With his double-edged view of investing, Manix is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   While brokers shuddered Thursday at the Dow's worst one-day
plunge since the October 1997 crash, America's individual investors
avoided panic selling of their stock funds and again showed the
resilience they have become famous for in this summer of steep
market swings.
</P>
<P>
   But investors have also begun to show a new trait _ an increased
willingness to buy more conservative investments that offer havens
of safety amid the stock market's storm, and a readiness to finance
such purchases by moving some money out of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of shoveling ever larger quantities of cash into
equity funds, helping to fuel the domestic stock market's record
bull run, Americans may finally be growing nervous over what the
market's near-term future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may be getting a little wary and are taking what they
would normally put into a stock fund and sitting on it in money
market or even a bond fund,'' said Thomas B. Tyson, an analyst at
Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That could portend a sea change in the investing habits many
observers see as underpinning Wall Street's spectacular gains over
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds hold more than 19 percent of all US corporate
stock, or $2.8 trillion in assets, making them powerful players on
Wall Street when their managers buy or sell shares. But stock funds
may no longer be Americans' unrivaled investment of choice.
</P>
<P>
   So far this month, investors have put new money into stock funds
at the slowest rate since 1991, when the US economy emerged from
recession and personal investing took off. After years of pouring
up to $20 billion a month and more into stock funds, investors had
put only $1.1 billion into such funds over the first three weeks of
August, according to Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a fund tracking firm.
The slowdown comes after stock funds drew in a net $19.3 billion in
July, roughly even with June, according to the Investment Company
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, money market funds _ short-term, conservative funds
that usually invest in stable government and corporate debt
securities _ have attracted an avalanche of new cash.
</P>
<P>
   Such funds drew in $24.9 billion in July, after outflows of
$1.59 billion in June, ICI data showed. Taxable bond funds, another
conservative investment, also gained in popularity, attracting $6
billion in new cash last month after winning $3.47 billion in June.
</P>
<P>
   And over four weeks through August 25, investors had sent a
whopping $45.4 billion to money market funds _ a 50 percent
increase over July's level, according to IBC Financial Data Inc. of
Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, combined with anecdotal evidence from a dozen or so
investors, suggest the $5.1 trillion fund industry may be in the
midst of a major change as Wall Street heads into what some
observers are calling a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the stock market turmoil has lasted over a month
may be beginning to eat into investor confidence,'' said Peter G.
Crane, IBC's director. ``People may no longer be willing to buy the
dips,'' he said, referring to investors who sweep in to buy
battered stocks. ``It's less that investors are fleeing the market,
and more that they're avoiding new stock purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 4 percent
Thursday in a day of wild swings on fears about Russia's growing
financial and political crises. The index is now 12.6 percent below
its July 17 record high, and is up just 3.3 percent for the year.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index _ full of the big-name blue chips
that most equity fund investors own _ slipped 3.84 percent. And
after years of big gains, the 25 largest mutual funds are down
anywhere from 5.4 percent to 17.94 percent since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions were behind most of the selling, analysts said. But
while professional investors talked frantically of Moscow's
meltdown and Asia's effect on US companies, average investors were
less excitable, if a bit wary. Some were unruffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried _ it's supposed to fluctuate,'' declared
Mahendra Bakshi, a computer programmer with a small fortune in 12
stock funds. ``These things are just going to happen from time to
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Major fund companies reported slight increases in the number of
calls from concerned investors. But they saw no signs of a dreaded
exodus from stock funds that could further roil the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our investors have stayed with their
investment plans and not pulled money out of their accounts,'' said
Anne W. Crowley, a spokewoman for Fidelity Investments. ``But we
have noticed a trend this month in which new money has been
predominantly toward more conservative investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity estimates investors will pull $1.8 billion
out of equity funds over August, equivalent to 0.5 percent of the
firm's total equity assets, compared to net inflows of $900 million
in July. But Fidelity predicts gangbuster sales of money market
funds at a whopping $4.5 billion this month, nearly double July's
$2.3 billion. Most of the money leaving stock funds so far this
month has gone into money market funds, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Group, the nation's second biggest fund company,
said investors had sent $1.7 billion to its stock funds so far this
month, a steep drop from $3.8 billion in July. But money going into
Vanguard money market funds has nearly doubled to $1.6 billion.
Investors also put more money into bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 100 percent in stocks, and I'm kind of nervous,'' said
Jeffrey S. Cone, 37, a pharmacist in Weymouth with $80,000 in six
mutual funds and a passel of individual stocks. ``I'm thinking of
putting future contributions in bond funds _ just thinking. But
I'll keep the stocks.''

STRATEGIES TO DEFLECT AN OFFICE DISTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Rick Brinkman calls them ``blurters.'' They are the
co-workers who blurt out loud any and every thought. They are among
the reasons a typical office worker is interrupted every nine
minutes throughout the workday.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where Brinkman, co-author of ``How to Deal With
Difficult People'' and ``How to Bring Out the Best in People at
Their Worst,'' got the every-nine-minute average for office
interruptions. But however often they occur, it helps to have tips
for stifling them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, blurters can be ignored or cut off. But no-bones-about-it
rudeness may damage long-term working relationships _ and that may
be more harmful than a few lost minutes of time.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Institute for Management Studies seminar in Kansas
City, Brinkman sounded a theme familiar to many workplace trainers:
(begin ital) You can't change others, but you can change your
responses to them.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   So, here are Brinkman's suggestions for interruption control:
</P>
<P>
   --Rearrange your office furniture. Position your back toward
your door or the aisle. If you don't raise your head and, even
accidentally, make eye contact with passers-by, you won't give them
unconscious invitations to enter your work space.
</P>
<P>
   --Check your body language. If you're busy but you react to an
intrusion by leaning back from the desk, raising your head or
removing your hands from your keyboard, your body is saying that
you're ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
   --Adopt an office signal that means ``don't interrupt.'' Closed
doors are obvious, but not everyone has a door. Some offices agree
on an item of apparel, such as a baseball cap, that can be donned,
or a desktop accessory, such as a small flag, that can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   --Stack things on your ``visitor chair.'' Making it harder for
someone to plop down may prevent protracted visits, although true
blurters have no trouble sharing while standing up.
</P>
<P>
   (One worker told me she tried the stacking trick, but the
resident office wanderer simply stood in her cubicle long enough to
consume 30 little Tootsie Rolls. Ancillary lesson: Hide the candy.)
</P>
<P>
   --Deflect conversation by your response. Say to the gossiper:
``Thanks for the info, but I won't stay in the loop if I don't get
this done.'' To the complainer: ``I hear you, but I can't give you
the time you deserve right now.'' To the hovering boss: ``Thanks
for the advice. I better get on it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice the statements of thanks, the message of empathy. Even if
you don't mean it, it's a somewhat positive response. The blurter
may not leave upset.
</P>
<P>
   You also might say at the outset, ``I only have a minute.'' But
you have to mean it. After one minute, say, ``I'm sorry. I have to
get back to work now,'' and do it.
</P>
<P>
   Once a conversation starts, Brinkman advises, you shouldn't
theatrically eye your watch and say, ``Oops! Gotta go!'' when the
other person is talking. Do it while you're talking. It's less
rude.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers may have the ability _ and a secretary's help _ to
block out times when they're noninterruptible. Most workers can't.
Most need to perfect individual blurter-deflection skills.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, most of us are blurters at some time or another. In
an I-blurt, you-blurt, we-all-blurt world, it's sometimes
worthwhile to let others blurt with impunity.

ECONOMISTS SEE STRONG US PACE DESPITE WORLD UPHEAVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world economy has churned up enough black
clouds to produce a major storm: Russia has joined Asia in a
financial meltdown, Latin American stocks are in a tailspin, and
once-mighty Japan has so far failed to moved with certainty to fix
a severe banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet economists still forecast continued growth for the US
economy. Not even Thursday's 357-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average, fueled in large measure by Russia's economic
crisis, forced many to budge from predictions that the US economy
would continue to expand for at least the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events, as dramatic as they are, just wouldn't be
sufficient to derail the US economy. The fundamentals here still
continue to be strong,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, economists say the bleak news of recent months,
which includes a renewed US war against terrorists and President
Clinton's uncertain political future, cannot overpower the
likelihood that Americans will continue to enjoy high unemployment
rates and the ability to earn and spend money.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that the nation is immune to the current
global financial turmoil. The US economy will certainly slow in
future months from the robust 3.9 percent growth of 1997, which was
followed by a torrid 5.5 percent hike in the first quarter of this
year. In a report Thursday, the government said gross domestic
product rose 1.6 percent in the second quarter, a slight revision
from the 1.4 precent it initially estimated in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect the slow growth to continue and say the odds
of a downturn remain modest.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group, pegs
the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 30 percent, up
from a 20 percent chance last fall. He foresees the economy growing
2.25 percent in the second half of this year, or 3.4 percent for
all of 1998, and slowing to 1.8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   At Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI, the Massachusetts forecasting firm,
chief US economist Cynthia Latta also puts the odds of recession at
about 30 percent in 1999. She predicts economic growth of 2.5
percent for the rest of this year, slowing to 1.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers, offering a more optimistic assessment, says the risk of
recession is no more than 20 percent while growth will top 2
percent for the rest of this year and will slip to an even 2
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why they are so far unfazed by the economic crisis in
Russia, economists said that Russia has always been more important
to the United States politically than economically.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Commerce, trade with Russia
totalled $7.6 billion last year, accounting for a tiny portion of
the US economy and making Russia only the 32d-largest trading
partner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a larger event than Russia's downturn to raise the
odds of a recession in the next few months, several economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of event?
</P>
<P>
   China could devalue its currency, which would reduce the price
of its exports and help it sell more products abroad. That would
likely force the already battered Asian nations of South Korea and
Indonesia to cut the value of their currencies, possibly followed
by the likes of Brazil and other emerging markets. The result would
be a smaller market for US goods abroad and a larger flood of cheap
products into the United States. All that would make it harder for
US companies to sell their wares, dampening profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take something on the order of China devaluing its
currency, which would trigger other nations doing the same, to
shift things so that the most likely outcome in the US is a
recession,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists say the US economy is so strong that it
could weather devaluation by China. Latta, for example, built a
weakened Chinese currency into her prediction of 1.5 percent US
economic growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger fear for her is that Latin America will slip into
recession. ``We export a lot of stuff there. It is a much more
important trading partner than Russia,'' Latta said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also fear Japan will not clean up its troubled
banking sector, leading to a continued recession in Asia's largest
economy. Japan has the power to turn the Asian flu into pneumonia,
Latta said, magnifying the effects of the Asian crisis worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important factor for the US economy is probably the
stock market, economists said. Consumer spending accounts for
three-quarters of US economic activity, and consumers appear to be
spending these days because stock market gains have made them feel
wealthy. A sharp stock market drop could prompt them to stop
spending, raising the odds of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said it would take an additional drop of 15 percent or 20
percent, beyond Thursday's decline, to produce a US recession.
Perna said the market would have to fall even further to have that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Mitigating fears of a recession is the fact that US
policy-makers have room to respond to signs of a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Japan, where interest rates are already at rock-bottom,
the Federal Reserve can cut the federal funds rate from its current
level of 5.5 percent. This interest rate, which banks charge each
other for overnight loans, has been as low as 3 percent in the last
decade, and lowering it would encourage more lending, spending, and
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike Japan, where the government has been loathe to cut
taxes, the US Congress could respond to a recession threat by
returning tax money to consumers. ``This has not always been the
case, particularly when politicians were paralyzed because of the
huge budget deficit we were running,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current headlines, it is easy to draw a doomsday
scenario for the world economy. But for each Russian crisis and
Latin American stock drop, economists said, it is worthwhile to
consider the American who just bought a new cellular phone, the
biotech firm that just brought a product to market, or the Internet
start-up that hired a laid-off Digital Equipment Corp. worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an extremely dynamic economy, with all kinds of
activities going on,'' Latta said. ``People continue to take risks,
and venture capitalists are willing to finance them, and you don't
find that every place in the world.''

ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL, CAUTION IS WATCHWORD REGARDING CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: With a general election a little more than two months
away, national Republican advisers are suggesting that candidates
approach the White House sex scandal with caution, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   They reason that if voters think Republicans are promoting a
scandal that people want to go away, a backlash could strike GOP
candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, worry that the scandal could cast
a cloud over efforts to elect their candidates to Congress and
other offices. In North Carolina, a Republican challenger already
is using a commercial linking Clinton to a Democratic congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians, however, are tiptoeing around the Clinton
scandal as if it were a cold they could catch. Phrases such as ``We
really need to wait for Kenneth Starr's report'' are common among
those watching opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, things are going to be unsettled,'' said Fred
Logan of Leawood, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate who isn't skirting the issue is U.S. Rep. Vince
Snowbarger, a GOP incumbent seeking re-election in Kansas' 3rd
District. He was one of the few officeholders in the nation to call
immediately for Clinton's resignation after his nationally
televised address Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger acknowledged that his position could come back to
haunt him. But he also said this was what he honestly believed. The
Democrat who wants to unseat Snowbarger, Dennis Moore, hasn't said
much about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, he issued a statement criticizing the president's
personal conduct and joining the chorus of politicians saying they
will wait for independent counsel Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a media consultant in Springfield, Mo., said that
the recent missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan were only
temporary diversions and that the spotlight would return to the
scandal, especially when the next sensational revelation surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd advise Republicans to keep their powder dry,'' said
Thompson, who works primarily for GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said the fact that so many Americans questioned the
president's motives in ordering the missile attacks points up the
credibility problem Clinton now has with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said an unsettled political picture terrifies those
charged with running campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka
Democrat, said: ``Republicans are going to be very careful this
doesn't become partisan and backfire on them. Of course, Democrats
have to keep their distance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years ago, the nation watched the Republican Party
go down to a humiliating defeat as Democrats gleaned an election
windfall from Watergate in the fall of 1974. The lesson hasn't been
lost on today's politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference, of course, is in the polls,'' Hensley said.
``In 1974, the bottom dropped out from under Nixon. That hasn't
happened to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats worry that it could.
</P>
<P>
   Another politician calling for resignation is Sen. John Ashcroft
of Missouri. His spokesman, Steve Hilton, said the senator
proclaimed in January that if the sex allegations were true,
Clinton should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Ashcroft) has consistently addressed the question of the
president's behavior as a matter of principle,'' Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although political fallout doesn't seem a worry for Snowbarger
or Ashcroft, other politicians remain concerned.
</P>
<P>
   They don't seem to know just where the scandal is going or what
effect it might have.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty, they suggest, might be voter turnout in November,
which wasn't expected to be large anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Snowbarger said, demoralized Republicans just lost
energy and stayed home on Election Day. Will Clinton's problems
have the same effect on unaffiliated voters and Democrats, groups
Moore needs if he's going to defeat Snowbarger in a largely
Republican district?
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this confession on the public in general
is that it increases the disgust for politics and politicians, and,
very frankly, I think it may affect turnout, and turnout may affect
this race,'' Snowbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   If people ignore the voting booth because of the scandal, he
said, the real loser will be the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University
of Kansas, said Americans don't have to look at the scandal to be
worried about the health of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already looking at a low voter turnout, and half the
seats in the (Kansas) House aren't being challenged this year,''
Loomis said. ``Of 435 races for Congress, only about 30 are truly
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans involved in campaigns say they can't
afford to worry about outside influences they can't control.
</P>
<P>
   Does Chris Esposito, Moore's campaign manager, worry that events
in Washington will cost his candidate an election?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to answer that question,'' he said. ``I worry
about fund-raising and turnout every day. The bottom line is that
an honest discussion of the issues and differences between Dennis
Moore and Vince Snowbarger will drive turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, he predicted, will play a much greater role in
Moore's campaign than Clinton's self-described inappropriate
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said there was no ``monolithic Republican position''
on how to deal with Clinton's problems. He said there was sentiment
among some Republicans that Clinton should serve out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said these Republicans want to keep an ``ineffective
Clinton'' in office and let the Republican-controlled Congress play
an even bigger role in driving national policy.
</P>
<P>
   And what about future revelations of misconduct? Logan said a
lot of campaign officials are not only nervous but holding their
collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should petrify campaigns,'' he said.

REGULATORS WANT MORE FACTS BEFORE ALTERING COD LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ Confronted by a roomful of angry fishermen, New
England fishing regulators retreated from taking emergency actions
to protect the rapidly declining cod population in the Gulf of
Maine Thursday, but they warned that more restrictions are likely
to come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal biologists last month urged the New England FIshery
Management Council to reduce fishing to ``near zero'' in the
once-abundant cod fishing ground that extends from the waters off
Maine to Cape Ann in Massachusetts. If that isn't done, they
warned, the cod population soon could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, council members said they wanted to know more
about effective recent limits on cod fishing have been before
closing a fishing ground that is vital to hundreds of small boat
fishermen, many of them already economically distressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to reduce (cod) mortality. The status quo is not
good enough,'' council member Eric Smith told the audience of more
than 100, but the council will wait until December, when it will
know more about the 1998 catch.
</P>
<P>
   The frayed nerves and short tempers of fishermen were much in
evidence Thursday, after five years of increasingly complex
regulations designed to prevent overfishing through a labyrinth of
catch and size limits, rules governing the mesh of nets, and other
restrictions that vary from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, dozens of fishermen began shouting in protest of a
council proposal to increase the size of the mesh in fishermen's
nets so that smaller fish get through. ``Look what you're doing to
us! We're just trying to make a living,'' shouted one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where the fishermen are coming from and they are scared
to death, and they have good reason to be,'' said council member
Jim Kendall, who also works for the New Bedford Seafood Coalition,
before the council decided to delay action on requiring larger mesh
nets.
</P>
<P>
   But council members were aware that delaying action may make
matters worse. Years of delay led to the collapse of one of the
world's greatest fishing grounds, Georges Bank, in 1994, and 13 of
the fishing grounds that the council oversees still are being
fished beyond safe limits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the National Marine Fisheries Service has concluded that
the cod population in the Gulf of Maine could collapse as well
after three consecutive years of record-low catches of maturing
fish and extreme fishing pressure from boats that no longer fish
Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen countered that cod seems to be increasing where they
fish, but Fisheries Service biologist Ralph Mayo told the council
that anecdotes don't change the fact that the overall fish
population is falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew this was coming ... for the past couple years. There
was going to be something that affected local guys,'' said Mayo in
an interview, referring to the small-boat fishermen who can't
change fishing grounds if the Gulf of Maine closes. ``Now their
backs are to the wall, both literally and figuratively.''
</P>
<P>
   The council left open the possibility that they will crack down
on Gulf of Maine cod fishing in December, after they have analyzed
the impact of reducing the daily allowable catch from 1,000 pounds
to 400 pounds this year. In particular, council members said they
would consider closing parts of the Gulf where cod spawn from
February to April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want industry to feel that because we vote up or down
on (emergency actions) that the discussion is over. There still
will be discussion of Gulf of Maine cod,'' said council chairman
Joseph Brancaleone.

LOTTERY OFFICIALS TESTING TICKET THAT WENT THROUGH THE WASH

 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ This money laundering could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   A Powerball ticket accidentally run through the laundry could be
worth $24 million for a man from the Kansas City area. He took
fragments to the lottery office Tuesday, hoping to strike it rich,
and took more in on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man told lottery officials he bought the ticket at the
convenience store where Saturday's winning ticket was sold. The
state Lottery Commission is testing to see if it is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket certainly isn't in winning shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kids, and I've seen their milk cards when they go
through the washer or dryer look like that,'' said Mike Loftus, the
Missouri Lottery's regional manager in Kansas City. ``It is what it
is _ bits of paper that may or may not be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Where else but the lottery can untold riches hinge on a dollop
of detergent or the whims of the spin cycle? Ticket mishaps happen
more often than you would think with this much on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area man, whose name hasn't been released by
lottery officials, never claimed to have a winning ticket. But he
wanted to check. Loftus said an outside laboratory will try to
reconstruct and examine the ticket. Experts can study the ticket's
bar code to determine its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Scroggins, executive director of the Missouri Lottery, said
that ``at first glance,'' the mangled ticket appeared to be one
where the player selected the numbers. Lottery officials have not
revealed whether the winning numbers _ 7-11-21-22-49, Powerball 19
_ were chosen or randomly generated.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, Loftus said, some of the submitted
fragments contained traces of a ticket bought in Kansas. It's not
clear if the mystery man submitted two mangled tickets or just one
mistaken one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we have clear, convincing, compelling information, we
will not declare it a winner,'' Scroggins said. ``I could see how
it might be disconcerting if you thought you had a winning
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Disconcerting? Call it your worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of poor Giovanni Conterno, an unemployed resident
of Turin, Italy. Conterno tore up a $60,000 winning ticket after
heckling youths convinced him it was worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Or the sad, sad story of Dale Miller, a Florida man who washed
his ticket with his trousers before learning it was a winner. He
threw the ground-up ball away, thinking it was worthless. Then he
learned it could have been identified by lottery officials, and he
spent hours in a fruitless search at a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   However, sometimes the stories have happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Three friends from Connecticut were able to redeem their winning
$40 million lottery ticket that was in a cooler when a can of
whipped cream exploded over it.
</P>
<P>
   And a state representative in Ohio sponsored a special bill so
Frank Louis III could receive his $100,000 prize, even though his
ticket had disintegrated in the wash. Louis was able to provide
clear evidence that he bought the winning ticket with three others
at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a feeling of complete hopelessness and helplessness,''
Louis said Wednesday. ``I was so upset at myself for even being in
that situation. But it worked out. I sure wish that fella (in
Kansas City) all the luck in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   States have complex security measures to identify winning
tickets. That's to protect themselves and preserve the credibility
of their games, officials in several states said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Lottery Commission has a chemist on staff who designs
tickets to make them difficult to alter. Oregon contracts with
state police to interview vendors and winners. Manufacturers
maintain a sizable database with detailed information about where
tickets are sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most states have very high-tech methods to check,'' said Barry
Miller, managing editor of Lotto World magazine. ``These lotteries
are open so much to criticism that they do everything possible for
security.''
</P>
<P>
   What about that fine print on the back of the Missouri ticket:
``Tickets are void and will not be paid if stolen, unissued,
illegible, mutilated, altered, counterfeit in whole or in part,
misregistered, defective, incomplete, printed or produced in
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials said they try to pay a winning ticket even if
it's not in perfect shape.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Torres of the Oregon Lottery said: ``We try to go to
whatever extent we can to pay the prize, but you have to guard that
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   His office had to deny a prize when a winner's ticket flew out
his car window.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had all the information, but he didn't have a winning
ticket,'' Torres said. ``You do feel bad, but there's only so much
you can do.''

THROUGH THE YEARS WITH ROBERTO DURAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ It is the sadness of his sport, the cruelty of his
trade, the unforgiving folly of his untamed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I can still fight,'' he says, and, oh, could Roberto
Duran fight when he was young and when his reflexes responded
instinctively to his savage commands and when the ring was a place
for him to terrorize people with his theatrical ferocity that made
him the most fearsome gladiator of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Roberto Duran fight when he was snorting and snarling and
scowling and leaving victims battered haplessly in his feral wake.
</P>
<P>
   I was there at the Olympic Auditorium in February and March of
1973 when he beat up on a couple of Mexican opponents with a wicked
insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   I was there at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal on that rainy
June 20, 1980 evening when he beat Sugar Ray Leonard across 15
dramatic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   I was there at the Superdome in New Orleans on Nov. 20, 1980,
when he uttered his infamous no mas
</P>
<P>
   to Leonard in a shameful surrender that diminished his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   I was there at Caesars Palace on Nov. 10, 1983, when he regained
a measure of redemption by giving the supposedly invincible, much
larger Marvin Hagler a frightful scare before losing a close
15-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   I was there at Caesars Palace on June 15, 1984, when all his
carousing caught up to him as he went down in two rounds to Thomas
Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   I was there to see him at his best and at his worst, and when he
was at his best there were few in the history of his mean sport
better than this flawed man who emerged from the dangerous streets
of Panama City to cut a memorable swath in his profession.
</P>
<P>
   I was there to see him fight for millions of dollars in front of
awed audiences who thrilled to his deft combinations and thundering
punches and aggressive tactics that so often turned his fights into
solo recitals of his punishing skills.
</P>
<P>
   And I never dreamed I'd be there tonight, on August 28, 1998,
less than a year and a half before the millennium, to watch Roberto
Duran attempt to win the WBA middleweight title from William Joppy
in Elvis Presley's old ballroom at the Las Vegas Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad, sad spectacle,'' says Bob Arum, and, for once, Arum isn't
saying it because his eternal rival, Don King, is the promoter of
this card that will be shown on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad only because Roberto Duran, at 47, no longer should be
doing what he started to do for wages on March 8, 1967 when the
Vietnam War was raging and Lyndon Baines Johnson was president of
the United States and his 28-year-old opponent wasn't even born.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad only because Roberto Duran has to continue fighting
because he has children to support and because he is broke despite
earning more than $50 million during his career.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad only because Roberto Duran has had 115 fights (102-13,
69 KOs), and he is at an age when his anatomy is more vulnerable to
serious risk than it was when he was young and quick and able to
get out of the way of punches meant to maim him.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad only because I remember Roberto Duran when his
presence stirred the multitudes to poetic hymns instead of the
ridicule that now greets his walk down the aisle towards his
appointed destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fight because I still like to,'' he says, and he was to pick
up a pittance, $200,000, to fight tonight because he has to these
melancholy days in which he serves as a symbol of everything that
is wrong in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you tired of doing it?'' he was asked the other day at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged with resignation, and said through an interpreter,
``Yes, sometimes. But I must continue. This is what I do. I'm a
fighter. It's what I do best.''
</P>
<P>
   The old fighters like George Foreman and Larry Holmes and Carlos
Palomino and Sugar Ray Leonard keep coming back because they miss
the big paydays and the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Duran never has gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duran's like a fighter from my era,'' says the veteran fight
figure Bennie Georgino, and Georgino's era was in the 1940s and
1950s when people like Sugar Ray Robinson and Ezzard Charles
detested hanging up their gloves. ``He's just unbelievable. He's
not what he once was. But he's still damned good.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes me feel uncomfortable that Roberto Duran still is
fighting. I wish boxing's governing bodies would pass laws to keep
aging men like Roberto Duran from ravaging their legacies and
risking their health, but boxing's governing bodies are nodding
toadies for the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   They do what they know will make money for their sport instead
of doing what they know will make sense for the boxers, including
one like Roberto Duran who has no business fighting any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working extra hard for this fight,'' says Duran
nonchalantly.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Roberto Duran spewed venom, and made
threatening gestures to the person he was scheduled to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The years have done something to Roberto Duran that they do to
all human beings, even the fiercest.
</P>
<P>
   They have mellowed him.
</P>
<P>
   The fire that once burned in his eyes is now gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is a job to me now,'' he concedes. ``At one time, it
was war. No more. Now it's something I just have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, there were shouts and laughs and thrills
surrounding Roberto Duran.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's only pity.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Russia in economic freefall and only four days
before a planned summit meeting between President Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, U.S. officials said Thursday that
Clinton would go to Moscow with words of encouragement but no new
money.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were hastily rewriting the summit script even as
they scrambled to devise a longer-range plan to prepare for a
Russia without Yeltsin, who has been the focus of U.S. policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration talked Thursday of creating new
policies for a new Russia, the United States seemed to be watching
the events from the sidelines and with a hesitation that contrasted
with the quickly offered monetary aid and statements of assurance
that have met earlier, less serious, crises in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have no new answers to Russia's
political and financial crises, and no new money to provide beyond
what the International Monetary Fund has already pledged, and
Clinton has already told that to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not hit the ground with a bag of tricks,'' a senior
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting this sense of uncertainty, a senior U.S. official
for the first time suggested that the summit meeting might be
delayed or canceled, after days of insistence that it would take
place as scheduled despite the lack of a functioning government in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The official, describing the situation in Russia as ``extremely
fluid,'' said that the administration was watching news reports
with one eye and the financial ticker with the other. As rumors of
Yeltsin's imminent resignation swirled, the value of the Russian
currency tumbled and the Dow Jones industrial average was down for
a time by more than 350 points.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel Berger repeated the
administration position that the U.S.-Russian relationship was
built on policies, not personalities. Echoing Clinton's comments to
Yeltsin in a telephone call Tuesday, Berger urged the Russian
president and his acting premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to continue
on the path of economic reform laid out by the previous government
of Sergei Kiriyenko, whom Yeltsin sacked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the composition of the government is obviously for the
Russians to decide,'' Berger said during a briefing on the
apprehension of two suspects in the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in
Africa. ``What we were _ what we are concerned about and would be _
are extremely interested in is the policy direction that the new
government takes. Does the new government stay essentially on
course with respect to economic reform and with respect to
democracy, or does it change course? If it changed course in any
kind of fundamental way, that would be of serious concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger was the only senior U.S. official to address the Russian
crisis on the record Thursday, a sign that the administration was
mystified by developments in Moscow and uncertain what to say about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored reporters' shouted questions about Russia during
a visit to Worcester, Mass., for a speech on education policy, and
later lashed out at staffers for not adequately briefing him on the
situation or preparing him for questions on it.
</P>
<P>
   But one White House aide said it was unlikely that Clinton would
have said anything Thursday on the unraveling situation in Russia
in any case, for fear of roiling financial markets and adding to
the instability in Moscow. ``Anything you say, the words get parsed
beyond all belief,'' the official said. ``You say something and it
gets picked apart, and it means whatever investors want it to
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a detailed briefing book for the summit at his
vacation home on Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday night, but it was
not clear whether he had yet read it. Glyn Davies, the executive
secretary of the National Security Council, flew to the island
earlier this week to help prepare Clinton for next week's summit
and to brief him on developments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with British Prime Minister Tony Blair late
Thursday afternoon about the Russian crisis and Clinton's visit to
Ireland and Northern Ireland next week, immediately following his
two days in Moscow. The two leaders agreed that continued economic
reform in Russia is ``vital,'' a British spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers returned early to
Washington from vacation to oversee economic preparations for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was in Moscow in a
series of urgent last-minute meetings to try to salvage some
concrete results from next week's meeting and to gauge the climate
for U.S.-Russian relations in months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's departure could certainly scotch plans for the summit,
but U.S. officials discounted reports that he was preparing to step
down. ``Obviously, the situation is tumultuous and day-to-day,''
one administration official said. ``We've heard the rumors, but no
one has given us any hint as of yet that there is a change'' in
Yeltsin's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still our expectation that the summit will go forward and
be productive,'' this official said
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the impending summit is a gift for U.S. officials.
It gives them a short-term event to focus on and allows them to put
off for another day the far more difficult question of how to deal
with a foundering and virtually bankrupt nation that possesses
thousands of nuclear weapons. Discussion of those questions has
been put on hold, one official said, until it is clear who will be
running Russia next week _ and after.

 WASHINGTON: and after.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Also unclear is whether the IMF will deliver the next $4.3
billion payment of a loan package, due Sept. 15. It depends on
Russian legislative action to reform the tax and pension systems _
votes that look increasingly unlikely. The Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, must first confirm Chernomyrdin as prime minister, and
the debate could be contentious and long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot save Russia, only Russia can do that,'' a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president can't calm the markets,'' he said. ``The markets
will be affected only by clear evidence of Russian seriousness of
purpose, from Yeltsin to the Duma, to fix the problems and ensure
that foreigners get a fair shake. But Clinton can engage Yeltsin in
a discussion of the political imperatives of handling the
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call to Yeltsin on Tuesday, Clinton pushed him in
that direction, an official said. ``Both Presidents reaffirmed the
importance of a clear, decisive strategy for tackling Russia's
economic crisis,'' said Barry Toiv, deputy White House spokesman.
``President Yeltsin stressed that this will be the top priority of
the new Russian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials, in a sign that they believe the Yeltsin
era is all but over, see the summit as a way to begin to build
bridges to the next generation of Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main public address of the two-day summit _ a speech
next Tuesday to students and young business leaders _ is an
explicit effort to speak over the heads of Russia's current leaders
to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will speak about the evolving relationship between the
countries and offer sympathy for the pain of the transformation
Russia is now suffering through, an official involved in summit
preparations said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton is scheduled to meet a dozen or more
parliamentary and regional leaders, another effort to engage with a
new generation of leaders not tainted by the Communist era or the
difficult transitional years of Yeltsin's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy in the United States and in Russia have
often questioned what they call Clinton's overly close relationship
with Yeltsin, ignoring other potential Russian leaders.
Administration officials respond that presidents deal with
presidents, that Russia has only one president at a time, and that
U.S. officials are in contact with Russian politicians at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Reddaway, a Russia scholar at George Washington
University, said he thinks Clinton should cancel his trip, in part
because there will be no one of real authority to engage, and in
part because Clinton may be greeted with ``nasty demonstrations or
comments'' from Russians who resent his close relationship with
Yeltsin, whom many Russians revile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish to undertake any initiative, political or
economic, in this volatile situation,'' Reddaway said. ``You can't
have a serious negotiation because there's no real government, and
it's hard to have negotiations with a president who may not be
there for more than a few weeks.''

 &HT;    Advice from a pro: Stay calm in storm
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Does Wall Street's plunge portend worse things to
come?
</P>
<P>
   What should investors do?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Atlanta money manager Richard Walsman of Sherrill &AMP;
Hutchins advisory:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term investors should continue to hold good investments.
Now is not a time to sell, especially if you have to pay taxes on
sizable gains, because you'll have less money to invest when you
put the money back into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, wild swings in stock prices can be unsettling, even for
savvy investors who realize that a market tumble often serves as a
pause that refreshes.
</P>
<P>
   So it's helpful to keep this in mind:
</P>
<P>
   Stock market declines are unpredictable, not only in timing but
in magnitude. Since 1953, the average stock market drop lasted
eight months. About 75 percent of the declines were recouped in
seven months, with a full rebound, on average, in just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market rises more often than not. Take the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index. Since 1926, the odds have been 7-to-3 that
it will rise over any 12 months, and 9-to-1 over any five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the longer the investment horizon, the less chance
you're going to have a loss,'' said analyst James Floyd of the
Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis-based investment and research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study shows that market timers, who dart in an out
of stocks as the outlook changes, perform worse that those who do
not attempt to guess at market swings.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in stock prices comes in very short bursts,
according to a University of Michigan study of the market between
1963 and 1993. It showed that 95 percent of the gains came in just
1.2 percent of the trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors believe stock market declines are an opportunity
to buy bargain-priced stocks. Walsman is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would not put all of my uninvested money (in) all at one
time,'' he cautioned. ``The market could go lower before it starts
going up. So it makes sense to commit some money along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy quality investments, such as stocks of companies with solid
balance sheets and bright sales and earnings prospects. That's
because in broad market declines, virtually everything goes on sale
initially, but the cream eventually rises to the top.
</P>
<P>
   That also applies to well-run mutual funds, Walsman said. ``I
was just about to pick up the phone to invest my 96-year-old
mother's cash in a growth stock mutual fund,'' said Walsman of the
no-load Marsico Focus Fund.

 &HT;    Coca Cola donates $1.5 million to strengthen Latin American
relations
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Coca-Cola Co. Thursday gave $1.5 million to the
Carter Center and Emory University to help build stronger relations
with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center envisions using its share of the five-year
donation to initiate a project called ``Transparency for Growth in
the Americas.'' After years of promoting democracy in Latin
American countries, the Carter Center now is turning its attention
to combating corruption by urging ``transparency,'' or openness, in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer McCoy, director of the Carter Center's Latin American
and Caribbean Program, said the objective of the initiative is to
ensure that public transactions are fair and accountable. The hope
is that the Carter Center will be able to work with Latin leaders
and the international community to curtail bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center plans to work with its Council of Freely
Elected Heads of Governments, a group of 31 current and former
Latin leaders working on democratic reform and economic development
in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful to the Coca-Cola Co. for helping make this
happen,'' McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which has strong economic and political ties
throughout Latin America, expressed no reservations about the new
focus of the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for all of us,'' said Timothy J. Haas, president
of Coca-Cola's Latin America Group, adding that businesses like
Coca-Cola flourish ``in free-market environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas said that the Coca-Cola Co. does not have any control over
Carter Center projects, but he is not concerned about any backlash
that could affect his company from the Carter Center's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly can stand the scrutiny of any spotlight,'' Haas
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to get its message out, the Carter Center plans to hold
a series of high-level conferences over the next five years where
it will invite leaders from throughout the Americas. The first
summit will be May 4-5, 1999, in conjunction with the annual CNN
World Report conference. The center also will work with Latin
American governments to encourage transparency in their
transactions. Already, McCoy said they have begun discussions with
leaders in Costa Rica, Jamaica and Equador.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University will use its share of the Coca-Cola donation to
provide 15 scholarships for Latin American students.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowships will provide an annual stipend for six students
entering the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and will cover
part of the tuition costs for nine students entering the Goizueta
Business School's MBA program.
</P>
<P>
   Emory President William M. Chace said the Coca-Cola gift will
help to further internationalize the campus _ providing a benefit
to both its current students and the Latin American scholars. The
hope is that the Latin scholars will return to their home countries
and contribute to the region's development.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Coca-Cola/Carter Center/Emory partnership
originated two years ago in conversations between Pedro Pablo Diaz,
Coca-Cola's vice president of communications for Latin America, and
Bob Pastor, who until recently headed the Carter Center's Latin
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was endorsed by the late Coca-Cola CEO Roberto C.
Goizueta, who was born in Cuba and was a strong proponent of closer
ties between Atlanta and Latin America, and M. Douglas Ivester,
Coca-Cola's current CEO.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the partnership is part of a ``growing momentum for
Atlanta to be the new gateway toward Latin America.''

BRUINS, ALLISON FAR APART ON CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He came to Boston to visit some buddies, such as Red
Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield, play in a charity softball game with Ray
Bourque and Don Sweeney, skate a few days, and address some issues
with regard to his living arrangement. But one thing that did not
bring Bruins star center Jason Allison to town is negotiations on a
new contract. The restricted free agent said talks with the club
are at a virtual standstill, the sides miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who suited up with a number of other players Thursday
at Boston University, is resolute in his position that he be paid
what he feels he is worth. However, the club is willing to ante up
significantly less, some $6 million over three years if Allison
reaches his incentives. Allison, Boston's top scorer last season,
said that if management is serious about that figure, ``We're in
trouble _ big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said, ``Oh, we're
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison finished ninth in the NHL in scoring with 83 points. The
23-year-old Ontario native was third in plus/minus with a plus-33
and ninth in balloting for the Hart Trophy as MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their thinking was when they said it was
fair,'' said Allison. ``I don't know if that was their first offer
and it was low because they thought my (demands) were high. If they
honestly think I'm going to go down there for three years, I won't.
I'm willing to work something out. I want to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad it has to be this way. That's the way they do things.
If it goes down to maybe they want to wait until camp to see if
I'll fold in, I'm not going to. They might as well just hammer it
out now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have a reputation for paying less than most teams,
keeping salaries in line, and not showing the kind of monetary
insanity demonstrated by other teams. But in Allison's view, that
doesn't mean he should agree to shorter money than he might make
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the right way to look at things,'' he said. ``If
you're in New York, you shouldn't say, `I'm in New York, I should
ask for more than I deserve,' or `I'm in Boston so I have to take
less.' That's what they want everybody on the team to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying teams should go out and sign free agents for $6
million but (the Bruins) are in a big market, they have the money,
they do well, it's a great hockey city. Pay your guys what they
deserve and that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' position is that Allison has had one terrific
season, which doesn't guarantee that subsequent ones will be the
same. O'Connell, who said he was reluctant to discuss the situation
because he feared a controversy would turn off fans much the way
the Mo Vaughn acrimony has, believes the club has done its homework
and that the offer to Allison is not only realistic but proper
under the collective bargaining agreement in place.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins sign Allison to a one-year deal, he has
arbitration rights next summer. O'Connell said that would be fine
with them because they are comfortable with their preparation for
the arbitration process. They'd be willing to agree to a three-year
deal if terms could be worked out, but he doesn't believe a
two-year deal would serve the club's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what I say, people are going to think we're
cheap no matter what we do,'' said O'Connell. ``The ball's in the
air right now. Where do we go from here? I don't know. We'll see
how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears to be going nowhere, which means that when training
camp opens for veterans Sept. 12, Allison will be nowhere in sight.
He acknowledged that the three-year proposal appears to be high,
but from the perspective of being the ninth-leading scorer in the
league, ``It's not high, it's low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their argument isn't that they don't think I'll do it again,
it's that I've only done it once and that's all they have to pay
me,'' said Allison. ``Right now they do (have leverage) but when
the season starts, who's got the leverage? I don't want it to come
down to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of upset that they didn't try a little harder. I'm
not surprised it's not done yet, but I am surprised they waited so
long. I figured they'd want to get me signed up so I can get ready
for camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to do is sit out, but if it's my only
option ... and I'm pretty stubborn, so ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good year last year, we had a breakthrough year with
a young team. Everyone is going to get better. If we don't get
everyone back, where does that leave the team?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant general Mike O'Connell said the club is
attempting to schedule a meeting with Ray Bourque to negotiate an
extension of the 37-year-old defenseman's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has one year remaining, which will be his 20th season in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell expects to sit down sometime before training camp,
likely right after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque consistently has said he won't decide whether to play
after this season until he determines how he feels physically. It's
likely that he would want to stick around if the Bruins became a
legitimate Stanley Cup contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins captain is scheduled to become an unrestricted free
agent at the end of the season, and the Bruins would like to lock
him up to prevent a bidding war for his services next July 1.

 &HT;    Big Southeast banks mostly insulated from Russian troubles
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bank stocks fell sharply Thursday, triggered by an
announcement from Republic New York that it will take a $110
million charge in the third quarter for losses in Russian
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The major banks doing business in the metro area suffered along
with their peers. But they have little overseas exposure and
virtually none in Russia. The exception is NationsBank, which is
soon to mate with BankAmerica. The latter has long courted the
world.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica has $412 million invested in Russia, but that's not
a large slice of pie given that the total assets of the new company
will be about $570 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For its own part NationsBank has a total exposure of about $1.6
billion in Asia and $3.2 billion in Latin America, spokesman Robert
Stickler said. Combined that represents about 1.6 percent of
NationsBank's assets of $308 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank closed at $65, down $4.25, BankAmerica at 73.75,
down $3.87 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a major player in the international arena,'' said
SunTrust Banks spokesman James Armstrong. ``The total amount
outstanding, including loans, acceptances (and) deposits at foreign
banks is $351 million, which is less than 1 percent of our loans.
Almost all of that is Canadian or U.K. exposure,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Banks hit a 52 week low of $58.37 1/2 before closing at
$59.25, down $2. It had reached a 52-week high a little over a
month ago and a few days prior to displeasing the market with the
announcement that it will buy Crestar Financial of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our total loan exposure in Asia, which is typically short-term
trade financing in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia is
approximately 1 percent, or $1.3 billion, of our total loan
portfolio,'' said Mitchell Singer, a spokesman for First Union.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments by First Union, by policy it does not ``have
exposure to emerging markets,'' said John Peters, who heads the
group that makes investments for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our foreign government bond portfolio, everything around the
world, constitutes about 8 percent,'' or $3 billion, of the banks
investment portfolio. ``A little over half of that is exposure to
Germany,'' which has done well, he said. ``At the end of June our
foreign division had unrealized gains of $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union closed $1.37 1/2 lower at $50.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Wachovia, which lost $3.06 1/4 to $79.25, said it has no loans
or equipment leases in Russia, and its international loans and
leases total $700 million out of total assets of $65 million.

for President Clinton to resign. But while I think his departure is
inevitable, he must exit in his own way, on his own terms, in his
own time. And that time has not yet come. By MARIANNE MEANS.

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Katrina Price was the first to arrive. The
rookie from Stephen F. Austin made the long haul from Waco, Texas,
with the help of her sisters, stopping overnight in New Mexico
before finishing to the 23-hour trek to Long Beach on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Williams arrived Monday, with a brace on her left knee.
She came early to have an MRI test performed Tuesday and, like
Price, to locate an apartment for the upcoming season. Natalie
Williams
</P>
<P>
   lives in Seal Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A tryout for practice players was planned for Sunday at the
Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Natalie Williams, who was preparing to leave for
Colorado Springs to train with the USA national team, everyone was
due to report Monday. Despite disturbing financial issues
confronting the troubled American Basketball League, located in Bay
Area conclave of Palo Alto, the grassroots women's professional
league was set to begin its third season of existence, its second
with the StingRays franchise in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp was still a month away, but Maura McHugh was
excited about the prospect of coaching this transformed team.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket sales were extremely slow, as well as corporate
sponsorships, but the front office was confident things would turn
around quickly once the players came in and used September to
market themselves to the community. The team was in the process of
signing sponsorships with Gillette and Vons.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bill McGillis continued to work tirelessly into
the night, making speech after speech on the StingRays' behalf
during the day. He had a skeleton staff no marketing or ticket
director that was doing the best it could with very limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Media director Linda Reid was finishing up the media guide that
highlighted the coming of Natalie Williams and the return of
starters Beverly Williams, Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil
</P>
<P>
   and Andrea Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   And then, poof, just like that it was gone. The enduring
practices, the long road trips, the hopes and dreams of returning
to the championship, the 15-hour work days, all of it was gone in
an instant. Effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe in the ABL and I'm optimistic about the ABL's
future,'' McGillis said. ``I understand that this was a business
decision. The investors in the league have spent a lot of money.
The goal is to sustain the league. It's unfortunate that we're not
going to give the franchise more time to mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were making progress. It's difficult to project what this
market could do at this time. Southern California is the toughest
sports market in the country. There's plenty of evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGillis was offered the general manager job in Columbus, McHugh
was offered a position in the league's player personnel office.
Neither have accepted and are unsure if they will. Like a deck of
cards, the players were divided up and shuffled off to the other
nine teams. The league is going to fly Price to Philadelphia, where
her car and personal things will be shipped, Beverly Williams plans
to return to Austin and have surgery next week for a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, before reporting to the two-time defending
champion Columbus Quest.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the league's decision to fold the StingRays
on Wednesday, McHugh spent much of the morning and afternoon trying
to contact players. Some she reached. Others received calls from
Tracey Williams,
</P>
<P>
   ABL vice president in charge of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the hardest thing for me, talking to the
players,'' McHugh said, sitting in her office at the World Trade
Center. ``There was some sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why they did what they did. I know that what they
did was for the longevity of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has to look at what's best for the league. We look
at it with tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh's involvement in the future of the league is uncertain.
She has two years remaining on her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing is to be a coach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she'll consult with her agent to figure out her next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm keeping all my options open.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Williams, the former Portland Power center and league
MVP last season, was traded to the StingRays on her insistence to
use a clause in her contract that stated she could play in Long
Beach. That's the main reason she signed for two years. She has
nothing personal against Portland, which she helped win the Western
Division last season and where she was reassigned to return, she
just wanted to be in nearby Southern California where she was a
two-sport All-American at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   She's now relying on her agent and lawyers to figure out whether
she's a free agent or if her contract is void.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't know for sure,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   She just wishes the league could of have had a little more
patience with the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I think Long Beach would have done a lot better. I
think more people would have come to the games than they estimated.
I know in L.A. people come as they will. It's unfortunate that they
didn't give them a chance. I think it definitely would have been a
lot more than last year,'' Williams figured.
</P>
<P>
   The league rushed to get a team into Long Beach, where it
thought it could thrive in a large television market as well as
feed off the Long Beach State women's basketball tradition of the
'80s, ABL chief executive officer Gary Cavalli said.
</P>
<P>
   On the first point, the networks ``didn't give us credit for
being in Long Beach. We were in Long Beach, not L.A.,'' Cavalli
said. On the second strategy, ``The Long Beach State tradition
seems to be a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, so are the StingRays.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Venus Lacy, the 1996 Olympian and former center for the
StingRays, has signed a one-year contract extension with the
American Basketball League. Lacy was traded to the expansion
Nashville Noise for Stacey Lovelace, who originally was with the
now-defunct Atlanta Glory. ... Results from an MRI test taken
Monday show that Los Angeles Sparks center Lisa Leslie suffered a
strained right knee. Leslie was expected to join the national team
in Colorado Springs next Monday and participate in a five-game
tournament with the Australian national team, followed by a WNBA
select-team tour in Brazil. Doctors, however, have recommended that
she not play for a month.

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT US STANCE ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS   AND COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just six months after the United States avoided a
war with Iraq, diplomats and independent analysts say the Clinton
administration has ineffective sanctions and no viable weapons
inspection to check Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the most outspoken American on the UN
inspection team raised questions Thursday about why Washington
softened its stance against Baghdad and blocked surprise
inspections even while talking tough about a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, a retired Marine captain who spent the past seven
years as a weapons inspector, fanned the controversy Thursday, a
day after resigning, when he said the UN Security Council and the
Clinton administration were breaking promises to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's conclusion: Iraq would keep its weapons of mass
destruction. ``People (who) think that they can just sit back and
say sanctions can bring Iraq into the fold; they are wrong,''
Ritter told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with the Globe, Ritter gave the impression of a
man who had been abandoned by his country. He confirmed that he had
been questioned by the FBI for sharing intelligence with Israel,
but he called the investigation ``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations sources confirmed a Washington Post report that
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other top US officials
had pressured the UN special commission teams, known as UNSCOM, to
call off surprise inspections in Iraq several times in the past
eight months. The administration did not want to provoke a fight
with Iraq that could lead to military conflict or an end to the
econonomic sanctions imposed by the UN, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up pressure on the administration to define its Iraq
policy, John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Thursday called for hearings on Iraq after the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings should examine whether the administration has
thwarted Iraq's development of chemical and biological weapons ``or
whether it has sought merely to avoid another inconvenient crisis
in the Persian Gulf,'' McCain wrote to committee chairman Strom
Thurmond, a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that our policy on Iraq is coming unglued,''
said another Republican, James M. Inhofe, chairman of the Senate
Armed Forces Readiness Subcommittee. While Democrats in Congress
mostly kept their criticisms muted, an aide to an influential
Democratic senator who follows the Persian Gulf questioned whether
the administration had been soft on Iraq. ``I would guess there's
going to be some explaining to do,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is especially worrisome for President Clinton
and Albright, who repeatedly vowed not to make concessions during
last winter's standoff with Hussein. They defused a crisis with
Iraq in February by letting Secretary General Kofi Annan mediate
with Hussein as three US warships cruised offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very troubling,'' said L. Paul Bremer III, the Reagan
administration's director of counterterrorism. ``I didn't like the
Kofi Annan agreement then and it looks naked now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bremer traced the current troubles with Iraq to 1991, when
President Bush halted the Gulf War while most of Iraq's Republican
Guard troops, tanks, and weapons were still intact. As the war
ended, Hussein agreed to abandon all efforts to produce chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're saying he can keep the weapons too _ at least that's
what it looks like,'' said Francis Brooke, a spokesman for the
Iraqi National Congress, a group that opposes Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference at UN headquarters, Richard Butler, the
director of the inspection teams, said the Clinton administration
had not placed ``undue'' pressure on him to rein in inspectors.
Butler also praised Ritter, 37, as a ``man of integrity'' who
served courageously in the face of intense Iraqi hostility.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM sources privately said they felt betrayed by Washington
and the United Nations. ``There are voices up there on the 38th
floor that do whisper that ... it's Butler's fault,'' one UNSCOM
official said, referring to senior aides to Annan who have
advocated a gentler approach to dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Ritter said the disarmament effort will
fail unless the United States resumes its threat to use force
against Iraq. He also accused Annan of being too conciliatory
toward Iraq, which has invaded its neighbors and killed ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary general is not a fair broker and his office
includes a number of officials with pro-Iraqi bias,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   A UN spokesman, Fred Eckhard, characterized Ritter's comments on
Annan as unfair. Annan's job includes acting as a sounding board
for the grievances of all member states, including unpopular
countries like Iraq, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has often singled Ritter out for criticism, calling him a
spy for the CIA and the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. ``The
resignation of the American-Zionist intelligence officer Scott
Ritter from the Special Commission is because his connection with
the Zionist Mossad was uncovered,'' a spokesman for the Ministry of
Culture and Information said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter scoffed at the allegations, but he made no secret of his
unhappiness at being questioned by the FBI. ``Scott Ritter has been
the target of so much abuse by the Iraqis and he has held up
remarkably well,'' said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for UNSCOM.
``They call him a spy, they vilify him and they hound him in the
media and he takes it all in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department official said the United
States is seeking to tighten economic constraints on Iraq. The
officials said the United States has stepped up pressure on Turkey
and Jordan to prevent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
smuggled oil from crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Washington also wants the Security Council to deduct the more
than $600 million Iraq earns from smuggling from the more than $5
billion Baghdad is allowed to sell each year in order to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And some observers said the Clinton administration is better
off deemphasizing the threat of force. Richard W. Murphy, a former
assistant secretary of state for the Near East and South Asia under
Presidents Reagan and Bush, said that looking for every bit of
weapons material in Iraq is a fruitless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He recommended placing stiffer economic sanctions on Hussein
until he complies with every last demand or loses power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I can understand Ritter's frustration,'' Murphy said, ``but
my attitude is there are some things we are never going to get
done: We're never going to totally uproot all of Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A pipe bomb exploded in a trash can on a busy Tel
Aviv street Thursday, causing one serious injury and adding to a
new wave of tension in Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions, in turn, have followed new signs that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may finally be prepared to strike a
deal with the Palestinians that would enable peace negotiations to
resume. The negotiations have been effectively frozen since March
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police described the bombing as a ``terrorist attack,'' a term
usually denoting Arabs. There were no immediate arrests, and no
Palestinian organization claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion happened at about 8:50 a.m. on Allenby Street in
central Tel Aviv. Police said the crude device consisted of about
100 grams of explosive in a pipe packed with nails.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic bin absorbed much of the blast, though many
surrounding shop windows were shattered. One woman was reported in
serious condition, and about 20 other people were treated for cuts,
burns or shock.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was the first in Tel Aviv since March 1997 and the
first in Israel in almost a year, and it came at a time of
heightened tensions on the northern border and in Hebron in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, a barrage of Katyusha rockets fired by guerrillas
of the militant Islamic Hezbollah movement from southern Lebanon on
Tuesday struck the Israeli town of Qiryat Shemona and parts of
western Galilee. The rockets caused only minor injuries and damage,
but they raised the threat that Israel would retaliate and trigger
a new round of violence in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The Katyusha attack followed an Israeli strike that killed a
leader of another Islamic militia, Amal. The chief, Husam Amin, was
struck by a laser-guided missile fired from an Apache helicopter
gunship as he drove in his car near Tyre on the Lebanese coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether the Hezbollah strike was in
retaliation for the killing of Amin, or for an earlier shelling of
Hezbollah strongholds by Israel's Christian allies in southern
Lebanon, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has insisted for several years that it fires rockets
into northern Israel only when Israel or the the South Lebanon Army
launch attacks outside Israel's self-proclaimed buffer zone in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, more than 1,000 militant Jewish settlers gathered
Thursday in the tiny, hill-side settlement known as Tel Rumeida to
mark the end of the seven-day mourning period for a 63-year-old
rabbi who was stabbed to death in his home by an assailant who
climbed through a window.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, a grandson of a venerated
chief rabbi in Palestine before the establishment of the state of
Israel, raised the level of hatred in the old center of Hebron,
where about 450 militant Jews live under heavy army protection,
even higher that usual. Though only seven Jewish families live in
the cluster of prefabricated houses in Tel Rumeida, they are
regarded as among the most radical of the Hebron settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 Palestinians who live in the section of Hebron still
under Israeli military control have been under a curfew since the
shooting, which has been lifted for only a few hours daily to
enable the Arabs to shop. But settlers have repeatedly tried to
beat Palestinians, or to damage their windows, market stalls or
cars.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Israeli troops were mobilized for the memorial
service Thursday, and the only incidents were a few scuffles as
settlers tried to beat and eject Palestinian photographers and
television cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service, militants voiced standard demands that
the government cease ceding land to ``terrorists'' and that the
army take stern action against them.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the stabbing last week, Netanyahu pledged
his government would build permanent housing for 50 families in Tel
Rumeida. The promise was apparently intended to placate the
settlers. Both President Ezer Weizman and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, whose moderate politics have made them special targets
of settler antipathy, were fiercely denounced at Thursday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   When Weizman paid a condolence call on Rabbi Raanan's family
last Sunday, he was assailed by a well-known radical, Baruch
Marzel, who shouted, ``You are a spy and a danger to the public and
should be put in an institution.'' Marzel was summoned by police
under Israeli laws against abusing public officials, and he said he
was questioned and released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen just as new signs were surfacing that
Netanyahu might be approaching a decision on withdrawing Israeli
forces from 13 percent of the West Bank _ which would enable
negotiations with the Palestinians to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in Oslo, Norway, Yasser Arafat, head of the
Palestinian Authority, declared that he could accept Israel's plan
to include existing nature reserves as part of the 13 percent
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But in subsequent statements, the Israeli leader appeared to
retreat on another issue, that of convening the full Palestinian
National Council _ the ``parliament'' of the Palestine Liberation
Organization _ to redraft the Palestinian covenant and excise all
calls for Israel's destruction. Netanyahu had been reported ready
to settle for the task to be done by some body other than the
council, which includes many Palestinian radicals in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting victims of Thursday's explosion in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu
declared, ``I want to declare in the clearest possible way that
there will not be a deal if the Palestinian Authority does not
fight _ in deeds and words _ murderers and terror.''

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT US STANCE ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just six months after the United States avoided a
war with Iraq, diplomats and independent analysts say the Clinton
administration has ineffective sanctions and no viable weapons
inspection to check Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of the most outspoken American on the UN
inspection team raised questions Thursday about why Washington
softened its stance against Baghdad and blocked surprise
inspections even while talking tough about a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, a retired Marine captain who spent the past seven
years as a weapons inspector, fanned the controversy Thursday, a
day after resigning, when he said the UN Security Council and the
Clinton administration were breaking promises to disarm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's conclusion: Iraq would keep its weapons of mass
destruction. ``People (who) think that they can just sit back and
say sanctions can bring Iraq into the fold; they are wrong,''
Ritter told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with the Globe, Ritter gave the impression of a
man who had been abandoned by his country. He confirmed that he had
been questioned by the FBI for sharing intelligence with Israel,
but he called the investigation ``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations sources confirmed a Washington Post report that
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other top US officials
had pressured the UN special commission teams, known as UNSCOM, to
call off surprise inspections in Iraq several times in the past
eight months. The administration did not want to provoke a fight
with Iraq that could lead to military conflict or an end to the
econonomic sanctions imposed by the UN, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up pressure on the administration to define its Iraq
policy, John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Thursday called for hearings on Iraq after the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings should examine whether the administration has
thwarted Iraq's development of chemical and biological weapons ``or
whether it has sought merely to avoid another inconvenient crisis
in the Persian Gulf,'' McCain wrote to committee chairman Strom
Thurmond, a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that our policy on Iraq is coming unglued,''
said another Republican, James M. Inhofe, chairman of the Senate
Armed Forces Readiness Subcommittee. While Democrats in Congress
mostly kept their criticisms muted, an aide to an influential
Democratic senator who follows the Persian Gulf questioned whether
the administration had been soft on Iraq. ``I would guess there's
going to be some explaining to do,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is especially worrisome for President Clinton
and Albright, who repeatedly vowed not to make concessions during
last winter's standoff with Hussein. They defused a crisis with
Iraq in February by letting Secretary General Kofi Annan mediate
with Hussein as three US warships cruised offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very troubling,'' said L. Paul Bremer III, the Reagan
administration's director of counterterrorism. ``I didn't like the
Kofi Annan agreement then and it looks naked now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bremer traced the current troubles with Iraq to 1991, when
President Bush halted the Gulf War while most of Iraq's Republican
Guard troops, tanks, and weapons were still intact. As the war
ended, Hussein agreed to abandon all efforts to produce chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're saying he can keep the weapons too _ at least that's
what it looks like,'' said Francis Brooke, a spokesman for the
Iraqi National Congress, a group that opposes Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference at UN headquarters, Richard Butler, the
director of the inspection teams, said the Clinton administration
had not placed ``undue'' pressure on him to rein in inspectors.
Butler also praised Ritter, 37, as a ``man of integrity'' who
served courageously in the face of intense Iraqi hostility.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM sources privately said they felt betrayed by Washington
and the United Nations. ``There are voices up there on the 38th
floor that do whisper that ... it's Butler's fault,'' one UNSCOM
official said, referring to senior aides to Annan who have
advocated a gentler approach to dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Ritter said the disarmament effort will
fail unless the United States resumes its threat to use force
against Iraq. He also accused Annan of being too conciliatory
toward Iraq, which has invaded its neighbors and killed ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary general is not a fair broker and his office
includes a number of officials with pro-Iraqi bias,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   A UN spokesman, Fred Eckhard, characterized Ritter's comments on
Annan as unfair. Annan's job includes acting as a sounding board
for the grievances of all member states, including unpopular
countries like Iraq, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has often singled Ritter out for criticism, calling him a
spy for the CIA and the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. ``The
resignation of the American-Zionist intelligence officer Scott
Ritter from the Special Commission is because his connection with
the Zionist Mossad was uncovered,'' a spokesman for the Ministry of
Culture and Information said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter scoffed at the allegations, but he made no secret of his
unhappiness at being questioned by the FBI. ``Scott Ritter has been
the target of so much abuse by the Iraqis and he has held up
remarkably well,'' said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for UNSCOM.
``They call him a spy, they vilify him and they hound him in the
media and he takes it all in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department official said the United
States is seeking to tighten economic constraints on Iraq. The
officials said the United States has stepped up pressure on Turkey
and Jordan to prevent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
smuggled oil from crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Washington also wants the Security Council to deduct the more
than $600 million Iraq earns from smuggling from the more than $5
billion Baghdad is allowed to sell each year in order to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And some observers said the Clinton administration is better
off deemphasizing the threat of force. Richard W. Murphy, a former
assistant secretary of state for the Near East and South Asia under
Presidents Reagan and Bush, said that looking for every bit of
weapons material in Iraq is a fruitless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He recommended placing stiffer economic sanctions on Hussein
until he complies with every last demand or loses power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I can understand Ritter's frustration,'' Murphy said, ``but
my attitude is there are some things we are never going to get
done: We're never going to totally uproot all of Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.''

GADHAFI SAYS `NEGOTIATION' IS NEEDED ON LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Col. Moammar Gadhafi said Thursday that Libya
would have to negotiate certain guarantees before he could feel
confident about turning over for trial two suspects wanted in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN from Tripoli, Gadhafi seemed obsessed
with fears of U.S. and British trickery. Experts say he may be
afraid that the two suspects, who are intelligence agents, will be
kidnapped by the West or pumped at the trial for more information
than he wants to see made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure America and the U.K. have good intentions to
solve this problem,'' Gadhafi said in English. ``I expect mines. I
expect tricks, conditions, to make the trial impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was stopping short of a promise to turn over
the agents, the Libyan leader added, ``Negotiation must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   He also warned against unspecified unacceptable provisions in a
U.N. Security Council resolution that would suspend sanctions
imposed on Libya in 1992 and 1993. Under the sanctions,
international air travel to and from Libya is barred, and the
Libyans are not permitted to import arms and spare parts for the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would also threaten ``further measures'' if Libya
failed to turn over the two agents.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, would be tried before a panel of Scottish judges in a
special courtroom in an as-yet-undetermined place in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the United States and Britain had demanded a
trial in Scotland or the United States. Of the 270 people killed in
the crash over Lockerbie, 189 were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, dressed in casual Western clothes rather than the more
elaborate desert robes he often wears, was seated in a wheelchair
during the interview Thursday. He said he had broken his leg when
he fell while taking part in sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the Middle East Institute in Washington, Mary-Jane Deeb,
editor of the Middle East Journal, said Gadhafi's appearance in a
wheelchair re-ignited interest in reports that his motorcade had
been shot at on a trip through the desert a few months ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There were rumors that the motorcade was attacked and that
shots were fired and that he was hurt,'' she said. ``A few days
later, statements were made that said nothing had happened to him.
But then he turned up in hospital saying that he had been playing
soccer and that he had to have hip surgery or something of the
sort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a couple of months ago, and I would assume by now
that he should have been on his own two feet'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Deeb, a professor of international relations at American
University and the author of two books on Libya, said Gadhafi's
repeated references to Western tricks and pitfalls reflected not
only his fears that too much information would emerge in a trial
but also that other nations work the way Libya does, and that his
intelligence agents could find themselves whisked off to Washington
as captives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives in a world of conspiracies and fears and anxieties,''
she said. ``He is a despot in his own country, and that's what he
would probably do himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats here say that while Gadhafi knows he is now
closer to having sanctions lifted than he has been in more than six
years, he also knows that he faces some political risk in turning
over one of the two men. Megrahi is a member of a powerful Libyan
tribe that supports the Libyan leader, who is not popular with
other tribes in a society based on tribal loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   To turn Megrahi over to the British and Americans could inflame
his tribe, a Middle Eastern official said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi's comments and government statements over the last few
days have left U.S. diplomats perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pretend to interpret what Libya's position is,''
said Peter Burleigh, the deputy U.S. representative at the United
Nations. ``I don't think it's clear. It is not clear to me that
they have accepted the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
reporters, ``We will know whether they have accepted formally when
the suspects show up at the court.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock market investors around the world rushed the
exits Thursday. Too many troubling economic questions and not
enough calming answers spurred selling from the time Wall Street
opened.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 4.19 percent, or 357 points, to close at 8165.99. The
Nasdaq composite fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow average now 12.5 percent below its July 17 high of
9337.97, investors are well into what Wall Street calls a
correction. Bear market territory _ defined as a stock price
decline of 15 percent to 20 percent _ is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   World markets fell in unison, with the exception of Hong Kong,
which was up slightly. In Europe, key indexes fell 3 percent to 6
percent, with the Dax index in Germany dropping 4.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, disappointed in Japan's inability to repair its
broken-down economy, drove the Nikkei 225 index down 3.04 percent
long before trading began in the United States. Policy paralysis
seems to have overtaken Japanese politicians, who appear unwilling
to take steps to solve their well-documented problems. The Nikkei
has fallen 16.5 percent this year from its March high.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in U.S. stocks was heavy Thursday: 940 million shares
exchanged hands on the New York Stock Exchange, close to the record
1.1 billion shares that traded last October when the market
declined 554 points. Margin calls were a major factor in the
carnage Thursday, as brokerage firms asked investors who had
borrowed to buy stocks to prop up their depleted portfolios with
more cash. During the morning, when an investor telephoned the
mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price to move some funds, a recorded
message announced that there would be a two-minute wait before a
representative picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and money managers reported a flood of early selling
that continued in waves all day. Even though stocks tried to rally
several times during the day, few, if any, buyers were willing to
pick through the rubble for bargains. The market closed at its low
for the day, a sign of overwhelming market weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit Thursday in U.S. markets were shares of big
international banks, down an average 6.6 percent on fears of
exposure to Russia-related lending losses. But rampant selling
ravaged even the most favored stocks, such as Coca Cola, General
Electric, Microsoft as well as internet darlings Excite Inc. and
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That even the healthiest companies' shares got punished was
attributable to investors forced to meet margin calls on their
emerging market investments. American investors are learning the
hard way, that when an investor has to cough up cash because his
foreign investments are cratering, he sells whatever he can. Often
that means selling the biggest, most liquid investment he has. Or
the investment he still has a profit in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vicious circle, said William Dudley, economist at
Goldman, Sachs in New York. ``People are becoming increasingly
risk-averse, leading to lower equity prices, increasing pressure on
emerging market economies. Absent right now is any mechanism to
break that dynamic up.'' As a result, Dudley believes investors
should brace themselves for more downside moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news started early Thursday. At 9:46 a.m., shares in
Republic New York Corp, the parent of Republic Bank, halted trading
in anticipation of a news report. Minutes later, the bank announced
it would take a $110 million charge in the third quarter for losses
in Russian government bonds. The loss would virtually eliminate
earnings for the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it became clear that the ultimate impact of the
Russian disaster was still unknown. If Republic Bank, known for its
strong balance sheet and conservative lending practices, was hurt
by Russia, what would happen to more aggressive lenders?
</P>
<P>
   With its announcement, Republic Bank became the first domestic
bank to shed light on its Russian losses. Market historians noted
that Republic was also the first domestic bank, back in the
mid-1980s, to reveal the extent of its exposure to lesser-developed
country debt that later hammered Citicorp and other American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in financial stocks Thursday found themselves in a
nightmarish version of the child's game of hot potato. Exposure to
Russia's ruble devaluation and effective default on its debt is
only starting to be defined. And since many of the losses will be
taken by investors who bought or sold derivative securities, where
the folks who took the other side of a given trade, called
counterparties, are not immediately identifiable, it could be weeks
before the true effects of what may be $100 billion in losses are
known. Some investors wondered why a country as economically
inconsequential as Russia should play such a dramatic role in world
market turmoil. Yes, Russian wields nuclear firepower, but it
accounts for just 1 percent of the world's trade, roughly
equivalent to that of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts explained Russia's role in Thursday's world market woes
this way: what happened there could very well replay in the
emerging markets of Latin America. When investors see their
portfolios lose 80 percent of their value, as those holding Russian
debt have, two things happen. Assets in other emerging markets need
to be repriced lower to reflect this new economic reality. And, as
those assets are repriced, investors and lenders withdraw from the
markets, cutting off companies' access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's default also made it painfully obvious that the
International Monetary Fund is no longer ready or able to bail out
countries in economic despair. Bailouts in Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand had lulled investors into believing that the IMF was
effectively a guarantor of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital is contracting rapidly from every place that has to
pay a premium to get money,'' said Martin Armstrong, chairman of
Princeton Economic Institute in Princeton, N.J. ``The Russia impact
is having serious significance in the sense that banks that have
taken hits there go down the entire emerging market group and
withdraw their credit lines.''
</P>
<P>
   So what investors are facing now is the very thing Wall Street
fears the most: the unknown. The devil we know, an imploding Russia
in this case, is bad enough. The devil we don't know, what other
economic disasters lie ahead, most particularly in Latin America,
is considerably worse.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on Latin America. That's because a crisis in these
nations would strike a severe blow to both American investors and
corporations. Some 25 percent of Brazil's $300 billion in domestic
debt, for example, is held by foreign investors. More important,
around 20 percent of U.S. exports go to Latin America.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some investors marveled at the selling that has taken some
stocks down 75 percent from their highs. One money manager said
that this is what happens when investors buy stocks only because
they are going up. ``People have been investing by the direction of
earnings and not looking at value,'' said David Eidelman, at
Eidelman, Finger, Harris &AMP; Co. in St. Louis. ``If earnings are
going higher, they buy. But when they start to see earnings come
down, they look at the direction not the value.'' As a result,
stocks get bid down too low. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, these
investors, so-called momentum players, know the price of everything
and the value of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   More than one professional trader said that Thursday's action in
U.S. stocks was reminiscent of the beginning of the end of the
great bull market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. These traders
recalled that the 1973 bear market, which removed 45 percent from
the Dow Jones industrial average, didn't begin in earnest until the
Nifty Fifty stocks _ names like Polaroid _ crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, approximately 15 stocks _ including Dell
Computer, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems _ have held up
while the rest of the U.S. market have fallen. Thursday, even these
shares fell hard.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Russia was the heartland of what Ronald Reagan
called the ``Evil Empire,'' bent on spreading communist dogma and
power around the globe, the United States developed economic,
military and diplomatic weapons to contain and eventually to help
eliminate the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Now Russia once again constitutes a threat to the rest of the
world. Its inability to manage its economy has destabilized stock
and currency markets from Moscow to Wall Street. The Russian
government itself is tottering, raising the possibility that Russia
might turn away from its ill-starred experiment with democracy and
return to its centuries-old tradition of authoritarian leadership.
And, of course, Russia is a nation that still maintains an enormous
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no emergency mobilization in Washington, no
metaphorical red light flashing at the White House, no public sense
that the United States must take urgent steps to protect the
interests of the industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made only the briefest of
comments, in an informal setting. National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger held a news conference in which he answered a number of
questions about Russia, but the announced topic of the session was
anti-American terrorism in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Clinton, who was making a speech in Worcester,
Mass., about crime, nor Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was
fishing in the West, dropped everything to rush back to Washington.
Indeed, Clinton seemed a bit at sea when reporters called questions
to him about reports that Russian President Boris Yeltsin might
resign soon.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way it was when the Cold War heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was also out of town, as were most
members of Congress. It is true that the Russian meltdown had the
impertinence to happen in August, when Washington, Paris, London
and Bonn become ghost towns, with politicians and bureaucrats
taking to the hills or sunning by the seashore.
</P>
<P>
   One larger truth in Washington is that in the current Russian
crisis, as in many other post-Cold War crises, there is not all
that much the United States can do. A second larger truth is the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Clinton administration has steadfastly
denied, like all administrations rocked by scandal, that the
Lewinsky affair has in any way affected the workings of government.
But individual government officials, high and low, tell a different
story. For a month now, they _ and indeed much of Washington _ has
been curiously detached from the ebb and flow of world events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put your head down, stay in your corner and hope none of
this muck rubs off on you,'' a State Department official said last
week. ``It is not an atmosphere conducive to good staff morale or
to creative policy-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Priorities change in subtle ways. Little attention is paid,
except by those directly involved, to this fall's elections. With
very few exceptions, such as medical care, domestic policy issues
have fallen by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's mind is focused, his aides have implied, not so much
on affairs of state as on the urgent necessity to repair
relationships with his wife and daughter and to rebuild his own
political standing. Otherwise it is hard to believe that he would
not have felt compelled to return to Washington from his vacation
on Martha's Vineyard to show that he was engaged in the Russian
problem, however limited his options.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, presidents are loath to be seen relaxing when
great events are underway in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Yeltsin has been as badly weakened as Clinton has
by recent events. Which raises the question: In that situation, is
there any real point to carrying on with the summit conference
scheduled for next week?
</P>
<P>
   A number of Russian scholars said they doubted anything could be
accomplished, but Arms Control Association president Spurgeon Keeny
suggested that the meeting could provide ``a critical opportunity
for these two presidents, who are hanging on the ropes, a unique
opportunity to demonstrate to their countries and to the world that
they retain the power of presidential leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, that would be most welcome to Clinton, and not only
because it would take people's minds off his sexual misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides have had to cope in recent weeks with a
whole spectrum of frustrating issues where the United States,
though by no means bereft of clout, lacks easy answers. Huff and
puff as it might, Washington is no closer today than it was a year
ago to ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. For all the
allied promises to end ethnic cleansing, it continues in Kosovo.
And anti-terrorism measures without number did not prevent the
sickening explosion outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania this month.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances differ from case to case, of course. In some
situations, building or maintaining alliances has proved difficult.
In others, the United States has tried to work through
international organizations whose attempted solutions failed. In
still others, existing problems have been compounded by errors or
ineptitude in U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the specifics, the new reality _ economic crises in
Asia and Russia, nasty local wars, often fueled by generations of
hatred, and strikes by terrorists _ have proved a lot more
difficult to handle than seemed likely in the euphoria at the Cold
War's end.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, a richly paradoxical situation: Helped by its
allies, the United States wins the Cold War, develops an economy of
unprecedented productivity and emerges as the world's only super
power, yet finds itself less powerful than before, not more so _ if
power is measured in terms of capacity to influence the course of
events abroad.

   UNDATED - (begin ital) Good evening. This afternoon in this
room, from this chair, I testified before the Office of Public
Opinion. I must take complete responsibility for all my actions,
both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you
tonight. As you know, in a deposition, I was asked questions about
my relationship with the U.N. Special Commission and my efforts to
delay or prevent intrusive weapons inspections in Iraq by United
Nations teams.
</P>
<P>
   While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer
information. Indeed, I did have a relationship that was not
appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse
in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely
and completely responsible. (end ital) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it should happen.
</P>
<P>
   So outrageous is the clandestine abandonment of candor and
principle in the implementation of U.S. foreign policy, that it,
too, probably requires a public apology by the president.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration was proclaiming the right to
``unfettered, unconditional inspections'' of any site in Iraq, at
any time, Clinton officials, according to the ``Washington Post,''
repeatedly were trying to halt surprise searches for weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States withdrew critical equipment and
personnel that had helped U.N. inspectors with their tasks.
</P>
<P>
   So unprincipled has been U.S. policy in this regard that the
longest-serving U.S. weapons inspector, former Marine intelligence
officer Scott Ritter, resigned in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He said the failure to aggressively push ahead with the
inspections was ``a surrender to Iraqi leadership'' and made a
farce ``of the commission's efforts to prove that Iraq was
concealing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought in the war,'' he said. ``Americans died in the war. I
was told by my government in April 1991, in a U.N. Security Council
resolution the United States sponsored, that Iraq was going to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've devoted seven years, at tremendous personal sacrifice.
I've poured my heart and soul into disarming Iraq, and this means I
was wasting my time. It means we lost the Gulf War. That's why I
care. I care deeply about this. The whole world should be shamed by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is not the first time that men of high integrity
have walked away from Clinton's unsavory policies.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Walker resigned his eight-year foreign-service job as
a desk officer for Croatia, describing U.S. policy as ``misguided,
vacillating and dangerous. . . . Our actions (or perhaps, more
appropriately, inaction) have undermined and threatened not only
the fate of the Balkans and the hundreds of thousands of victims
there, but also vital U.S. national interests,'' Walker wrote in
his resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Walker resignation followed the departures of Marshall
Harris, the Bosnia desk officer, and Jon Western, an intelligence
research specialist, who quit in protest over the failure of the
United States to respond appropriately to the Balkan tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   We do not know where the Clinton administration goes from here
in an endeavor to restore honor and truthfulness in foreign
affairs, but a public apology would be a fine place to start. &QL;

BABBITT (Washington) - Grand jury subpeonas have begun to fly in
the indepdendent counsel investigation of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt. The requests for documents have Interior employees
scouring four years worth of e-mail and pulling records on nearly
every instance of taking land in trust for Indian tribes. The
Burton Committee has turned over reams of paper it collected in its
investigation, and its staff has met with some of the nine
principle investigating attorneys hired by Carol Elder Bruce. One
attorney's hiring in particular has been questioned by
conservatives concerned about his ties to Democrats, but that
hasn't slowed the probe, which is on the fast-track, sources say,
to a determination by the end of the year. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story

RUSSIA LOSSES WILL WIPE OUT THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS FOR REPUBLIC
CORP. 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adding to anxiety about the risk banks are facing
around the world, Republic New York Corp., considered one of the
most conservatively managed banks in the United States, said
Thursday that its losses in Russia would wipe out all of its
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republic, which trades in some of the world's most
exotic markets, was the only bank to disclose losses in Russia
Thursday, it was hardly the only bank stock to suffer from the
fears of shareholders. Investors, reacting to a confluence of real
or expected economic downturns in several regions, have concluded
that the financial risks facing banks in the near future are too
worrisome. They fled bank stocks with a vengeance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the entire world just got a margin call and everyone
is stampeding out of emerging markets,'' said David Berry, a
banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. ``Everybody wants
their money back at the same time. The '90s are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks were not the only companies feeling the heat. Shares of
leading brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter sank Thursday, with losses in the shares of Lehman Brothers
outpacing the group. Lehman plunged $7.25, or 12.6 percent, to
$50.4375.
</P>
<P>
   An individual close to Lehman's trading operation said the firm
expected a ``several million dollar'' loss on a Latin American swap
transaction involving the Russian ruble. This person said that
emerging-markets turmoil might reduce third-quarter earnings by
about 11 percent from the company's earlier projections. A Lehman
spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Republic said it planned to take a $110 million pre-tax charge
in the quarter for losses related to a sharp drop in the value of
short-term Russian bonds known as GKOs.
</P>
<P>
   Republic, which earned about $119 million in the second quarter,
also said it would take a charge of $45 million against reserves
because of ``current and anticipated Russian counterparty
defaults.'' Republic declined to specify what that charge involved,
but analysts said the language suggested losses on derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, Safra Republic Holdings SA, a
private European banking unit that is 49 percent owned by Republic,
said it would take a third-quarter charge of $65.9 million because
of losses in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Republic is controlled by Edmond Safra, a legendary banker whose
family has been involved in the industry for more than 150 years.
It is also one of the trading houses favored by George Soros, one
of the world's leading currency speculators. Soros' investment
company announced Thursday that it had lost about $2 billion in
Russia over the last year. Republic and Soros' company declined to
comment on any trading Soros may have done through the bank.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Republic
plunged $4.625, or 9.23 percent, to $45.50. Other bank stocks were
also battered, continuing more than a monthlong slide born out of
concern about economic problems in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J. P. Morgan plunged $13.1875, or 11.2 percent, to
$104.75; Chase Manhattan fell $6.125, or 9.34 percent, to $58.125;
Bankers Trust fell $8.3125, or 9 percent, to $83.8125; Citicorp
fell $11.875, or 8.9 percent, to $122; BankBoston dropped $2.375,
or 5.74 percent, to $39; and BankAmerica fell $3.875, or 5 percent,
to $73.75.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The losses in Russia are an unaccustomed, though not unheard of,
blow for Republic, the nation's 21st-largest bank with about $60
billion in assets. Safra, 66, chairman of Safra Republic, currently
owns 28.5 percent of Republic New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although it maintains a traditional branch network in New York,
Republic's more intriguing businesses are in private banking,
precious metals trading and financial services it performs for
securities firms and highly volatile hedge funds. Indeed, many
hedge funds, like those of Soros, have been battered recently in
emerging markets such as Russia, and their losses may have been
felt by Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for J.P. Morgan or Bankers Trust to make an
announcement like this because they're usually much more active in
those markets,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with Tucker
Anthony, a research and brokerage firm in Portland, Me. ``But
Republic, and rightfully so, has always been perceived as far more
cautious and conservative. For this to happen to them is a real
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the first time Republic's trading operation has
suffered a setback. A federal judge in New York recently forced the
bank to pay more than $13.5 million to two wealthy Pakistani
investors, Zahid Ashraf and his wife, who contended the bank
mishandled trading accounts involving complex currency
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disastrous effect losses in Russia are having on
Republic's earnings, most of the largest U.S. banks have ample
cushions to absorb any losses there.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp and Chase, for example, each earned more than $1
billion in this year's second quarter and said they had $420
million and about $500 million respectively in exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said J.P. Morgan, which earned $402 million in the
second quarter, had exposure of less than $400 million in Russia,
but it is also one of the world's biggest traders and underwriters
of emerging-markets debt and could be more severely hurt by
problems in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, which declined to comment on its earnings
outlook, may be one of the most vulnerable big banks in Russia.
Analysts said the bank, which earned only $164 million in the
second quarter, had exposure in Russia of roughly $1 billion,
including about $500 million to hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it is clear that Russia is only part of the mix
when it comes to investor worries about economic developments
overseas, worries that are not likely to be put to rest until banks
and other companies begin reporting third quarter earnings in
October.

COUGAR HAS CLAWS BUT LACKS REAL ROAR  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, AUG. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   UNDATED - Mercury Cougar returns to its sports-coupe roots this
fall with an all-new, front-wheel-drive entry designed to attract
younger buyers to the Mercury fold.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cougar also marks a rare instance, the first since its
short-lived two-seater convertible Capri, in which Mercury will
have a car all its own, rather than sharing iron with big brother
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury execs say it's part of the division's recent efforts to
emerge from the Ford umbrella and create an identity for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique platform, Cougar's
forward-looking styling is marked by sharp, catlike contours; an
athletic stance; unique, bulging headlight and rear-light lenses;
and an interior that's both futuristic and retro.
</P>
<P>
   It's smaller and sportier than the previous model, which was a
Thunderbird clone, and brings a distinctive new face to the
mid-priced sports-coupe field.
</P>
<P>
   Ford calls the look New Edge styling, and promises to bring some
of those design elements into other Mercury offerings. Well, maybe
not the Grand Marquis or the Mountaineer sport-utility vehicle.
Already, Mystique and Tracer are taking on cat-eyed and cagey
looks.
</P>
<P>
   I tested a preproduction version of the Cougar a few months back
and came away with mostly favorable impressions of the V-6-powered
coupe. Steering and handling were tight and balanced, and the
engine had some pull once the RPMs started to climb, helped along
by a quick-shifting five-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent, production-model test car I drove was hampered
by an automatic transmission that couldn't deliver the poise and
power of the five-speed version. What had been a rev-happy V-6
ready to hum was now a bogged-down motor that never got a chance to
reach its potential. What was a raspy, sports-car exhaust note
became a low moan.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. There are ways to mate an automatic with a small,
sporty engine whose power band is in the upper register, but this
isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cougar got under way, the engine power kept it at
comfortable highway speed, up and down grades, but acceleration was
met with a resistance that is not in keeping with the Cougar's
sporty intent.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a base four-cylinder engine, which turns 125
horsepower, for economical Cougar drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The New Edge styling received lots of favorable nods on the
road, with several fellow drivers straining their voices to shout
questions about its price and availability. In size and shape, it's
similar to the Mitsubishi Eclipse, with a low, crouchy front aspect
and a broad rear end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar's severe angles of taillights, headlights and windows
do evoke the claws of a cat. Creases and compound curves on the
fenders and doors give the coupe a concept-car look.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar seems to have more interior space than the Eclipse,
with lots of front-seat legroom and headroom, and a usable if not
exactly commodious back seat. With its hatchback configuration,
trunk space can be expanded to include the folding back seat,
making a decent vacation getaway car for two.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard and door panels continue the concept-car look,
with loads of curving forms, round pieces and looping door handles.
Little, shiny plastic cougar-head medallions on the door handles
look cheap and tacky.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic air ducts are round aircraft style, which operate
easily, though they feel flimsy. They remind me of the
air-conditioning ducts in the late '50s, although those were made
of heavy chromed metal.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning system in our test car also had trouble
cutting the edge off the dog days of August.
</P>
<P>
   In a sporty coupe designed for a youthful audience, the
fun-to-drive quotient is all important. Aside from the
power-robbing slushbox, the Cougar acquitted itself well in terms
of road-feel, steering quickness and the ability to zip around
curves with aplomb and limited body sway.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-inch wheels and tires help the drivability considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Cougar can reach its niche audience remains to be seen.
Despite the old name, it's still the new kid on the block with
heavy competition from the likes of Eclipse, Acura Integra,
Infiniti G20 and, when you get down to it, Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar is a new take on the theme, though, and should
attract those who crave the latest. There's also the price, which
is competitive for a sporty car with decent performance and a
strong image. The options are not too expensive, although anti-lock
brakes cost $500 extra. They should be standard.
</P>
<P>
   Just be advised that the stick shift version provides much more
satisfying fun and performance. &QL;

`NEXT STOP' IS A GO IN LOOK AT '90S LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   UNDATED - ``Next Stop Wonderland'' is an indie film in a lot of
the right places.
</P>
<P>
   It has a sketchy, impressionistic rhythm, the camera circling
around its characters documentary-style. The bossa nova soundtrack
gives this talky romance both sophistication and warmth, but,
unlike the swelling orchestration of most mainstream movies,
doesn't italicize every big moment. Its lead, Hope Davis, has
silky, blond, Hollywood-worthy hair, but a deadpan gaze that would
leave a studio stud like Keanu Reeves stammering his lines.
</P>
<P>
   It's these features that helped anoint ``Wonderland'' the
official sensation of the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, the
independent world's most prestigious competition. Miramax Films,
the independent world's most prestigious distributor, purchased the
movie after its first screening, which is tantamount to winning the
lottery with your first ticket.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is interesting treatment of a story that wouldn't
be out of place as a half-hour network TV episode, much less a
big-screen Jennifer Aniston-type vehicle: Single girl, recovering
from bad break-up, is unwillingly cajoled by her mother into a
disastrous series of dates with guys she meets through the personal
ads. Meanwhile, she and the designated Mr. Right keep missing each
other by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Davis (a regular in independents such as ``The Daytrippers'' and
``The Myth of Fingerprints``) plays Erin, a Boston nurse who has
been dumped by her Greenpeace-slogan-spouting boyfriend _ ``You do
not like the masses!'' he cites as a reason for leaving _ and has
soured on men. We know she should end up with Alan (Alan Gelfant),
a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who's much better than his
loutish, yuppie friends.
</P>
<P>
   The movie arranges for Erin and Alan to cross paths several
times, without connecting _ one of those nice cinematic gimmicks
that, again, in the hands of a mainstream director, would be the
movie's focus. Here, it's just a series of nicely underplayed
asides.
</P>
<P>
   There are some subplots involving the aquarium at which Alan
volunteers, and his troubles with a loan shark. They, too, are the
stuff of situational television and don't seem to serve much of a
purpose. But they don't intrude much on the heart of the movie,
which is Erin's defrosting as she negotiates through a forest of
dwarves to meet her prince.
</P>
<P>
   Director/co-writer Brad Anderson maintains a taut line of
low-key humor. That comes mostly from interplay between the two
leads and the crazies that surround them. Davis and Gelfant are the
anchors: She's wry and sharp, even in her mopey state. He's decent
and sexy, and hopeful, despite the obstacles blocking him in
pursuit of his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The bit players, though, come from a stranger planet _ Alan's
lawyer brother and his weak-chinned pals, who all misattribute the
same line about ``the hobgoblin of little minds,'' and Erin's
coworkers, whose characters are drawn with crayons. ``Wonderland''
occasionally colors outside the lines, as with a trigger-happy,
homophobic security guard. With such characters and a plot hatched
in Sitcomland, ``Wonderland'' isn't quite an indie wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But these are quibbles in what is otherwise a delightfully
sidelong love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop Wonderland'' is rated R for some adult and sexual
situations. There's no nudity, and little profanity. The only
violence involves a fish. 3 stars. &QL;

ROCK'N'ROLL STAR PLAYS ROMANCE WAY OUT OF TUNE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - In rock and roll, if the way up doesn't get you, the
way down will. Rock fame will make someone out of nothing, then
turn around and make nothing out of someone.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Frankie Lymon story, as told in the movie named after
his big hit, ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love''?
</P>
<P>
   In Lymon's case, they should have asked, why do fools fall in
love three times?
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set during a lawsuit, when three disputatious women
claim to be Lymon's widow, thus entitled to the royalties that he's
owed for his songs.
</P>
<P>
   As the women testify about how they met the singer, we travel to
the early days of rock, when Frankie (Larenz Tate) and his group
become an overnight sensation, the princes of doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he falls in love the first time, with Zola (Halle
Berry), who sang with the Platters.
</P>
<P>
   This early part of the story captures the highs of rock,
Frankie's love of performing and the rush of his fame.
</P>
<P>
   All of which falls apart far too quickly, as his group breaks
up, his manager loses interest, and Frankie turns to hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His second love, Elizabeth (Vivica Fox), represents the ugly
side of what can happen to a young guy who becomes a has-been
before he can even become what he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Emira (Lela Rochon), wife No. 3, picks up Frankie's story when
the singer tries to reform and resist the lure of rock-and-roll
comeback fame.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gregory Nava holds the story together, despite rapid
movement through time and point of view, to reveal the dark,
destructive side of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Nava ``(Selena)'' doesn't use many songs, but stages them with
great excitement. Instead, he primarily focuses on what happens
when the music stops.
</P>
<P>
   Berry ``(Bulworth)'' and Fox ``(Soul Food)'' are excellent, as
they deal not only with the past but with each other, adding a
level of humor that comes from surviving hard lives without
cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Tate ``(The Postman)'' personifies the thrill of performing in
front of a cheering crowd and the sense of bewilderment when the
cheering fades and the thrill is gone.
</P>
<P>
   No denying that the real Lymon had the heat but lost it. Same
goes for the movie, which circles a few times too many around the
same material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the picture is enlivened by an appearance from the real
Little Richard, who adds a little wopbopaloobopalopbamboom to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' is rated R for profanity, drug
use, nudity and sex. 2 stars. &QL;

CANADA RAISES INTEREST RATE TO PROTECT ITS DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ After weeks of hesitation, Canada's central bank
raised its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point
Thursday in an effort to halt the slide of the Canadian dollar,
which has lost more than 10 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in the overnight lending rate to 6 percent,
the Canadian dollar swooned again, to 63.34 U.S. cents in New York
from 63.79 cents on Wednesday, leading many analysts to question
the effectiveness of the central bank's actions and to worry about
its effect on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will help at all,'' said Jeffrey Cheah, a
financial market analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS here.
``Consumer confidence is already at very low levels because the
currency is depreciating almost every day. This will just compound
the lack of consumer confidence in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market did not help matters either, with the Toronto
Stock Exchange following the sharp decline of other markets. The
exchange's index of 300 stocks fell 372.84 points, or 6.04 percent,
to 5,799.46.
</P>
<P>
   John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said
the central bank had wanted to ride out current conditions,
thinking higher interest rates were unnecessary because the
Canadian economy was slowing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian dollar _ called a loonie because the dollar coin
bears the image of a common loon _ has been battered by contraction
in the commodities market and problems in Asia and Russia. On
Wednesday, it suffered its biggest one-day loss in three years,
falling .73 cent, to 63.79 cents, an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the Bank of Canada said: `Enough is enough. We
go,' '' McCallum said.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's largest banks quickly followed suit and raised prime
lending rates 1 percentage point to match the central bank's move.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, the Bank of Canada indicated
that the continuing slide in the value of the dollar represented a
diminishing confidence in Canadian investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's increase in interest rates is aimed at providing
support for the Canadian dollar in order to bolster confidence,
while preserving monetary conditions that will help to sustain the
present noninflationary expansion of the economy,'' the bank's
statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase was the first in more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other analysts, McCallum sees raising interest rates
as a fairly useless move in the face of so many other problems
around the world. ``We're in the eye of a storm, with Russia
crumbling and Asia suffering through difficult times,'' McCallum
said. ``These are forces beyond our control. If we try to resist
with interest rate hikes, what we will get are negative effects on
our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Canadian economy has managed to retain much of
its strength despite the currency troubles. With practically no
inflation and a federal budget surplus, analysts had expected
growth to be relatively brisk this year, until Thursday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Cheah of Standard &AMP; Poor's said the agency would be revising
gross domestic product estimates downward. ``The interest rate hike
is not going to have an immediate impact but will be most strongly
felt three to six months from now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic effect of the higher interest rates will be offset
somewhat by the advantages of a cheaper dollar, which helps exports
and tourism, McCallum said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect the loonie to continue losing value, but
how far it will slide is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian dollar is going to hit 61 before Mark McGwire
does,'' Serge Lacroix, a vice president of bond investments at
Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. in London told Reuters. The first
baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals hit his 54th home run on
Wednesday night.

PREVIOUS SEX OFFENDER ARRAIGNED IN GIRL'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUTNAM, Conn. _ Composed as she clutched a child's photo album,
Millie Mercado waited for the arraignment of her daughter's alleged
killer to begin.
</P>
<P>
   She waited for 2 hours and 10 minutes before the muscles in her
face broke apart, and she quietly collapsed. She bent her head, and
a curtain of hair hid the tears that flowed for her only child,
11-year-old Angelica Padilla, who was murdered Aug. 13 as she
delivered newspapers in her neighborhood in nearby Willimantic. But
Mercado's soft wimpers escaped, and echoed against the blond wood
walls of the Putnam Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Jose A. Torres entered the courtroom bound in
chains to face capital murder charges that he brutally killed
Angelica in a sexually motivated crime. Torres, a 26-year-old
convicted sex offender whose history of assault sat unread and
unknown inside a local police registry for two years in
Willimantic, listened as a Spanish interpreter translated the
proceedings. A not-guilty plea was entered on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In a graphic recounting of the incident meant to ensure a $1
million bond for Torres, state attorney Mark S. Solak said Angelica
``was literally butchered.'' He said the slashing of her throat in
a basement laundry room just below Torres' apartment amounted to a
``virtual decapitation of the little girl's head,'' cutting into
several major arteries.
</P>
<P>
   As Solak spoke, quiet wails erupted in the courtroom, one of the
few displays of emotion during the 9-minute arraignment. The
hearing began with a stern call for order by Judge Samuel Sferrazza
that sealed the courtroom off from a town's two-week-old anxiety
and its last 12 hours of explosive anger following Torres' arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When Sferrazza granted the $1 million bond, only a tight, hushed
``yes'' escaped from the back of the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the carthasis in Willimantic was palpable Wednesday night,
when a mob of 300 neighbors from the Colonial Townhouse complex on
Foster Drive, where Angelica and Torres both lived, gathered at
Building 14 to witness his arrest. They cheered police on and
shouted out, ``Killer!'' as he was led away from the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in court, Torres' public defender, Mark Shapera, said
the climactic public arrest has already tainted the case against
his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case should be tried in a court of law, not to a mob and
not through the media,'' said Shapera, who requested a medical and
suicide watch and protective custody for Torres. ``The state has
orchestrated this case. ... I don't think it has the strong
evidence it claims it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapera also said Torres was denied his right to see a lawyer
after requesting one 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court after the hearing ended, Solak responded to
claims that police had played to the media. ``Those charges, I
believe, are absurd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment left Millie Mercado with little of the stoic
mask she had arrived with, when she and five relatives had locked
arms and proceeded into the court wearing white T-shirts with
pictures of Angelica over their chests. Shattered as she stood
before a bank of microphones after the hearing, Mercado said, ``I
couldn't be grateful enough to everyone in the community for
everything everyone has done.''
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment was held in Putnam, about a 20-minute drive from
Willimantic, because of concerns about security, State Police said.
That fact, and the jeers from a crowd of residents as Torres was
led from the court in a police car, underscored the trauma and
violent emotion that have scarred this college town in northeast
corner of Connecticut, once known as the thread capital of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Willimantic, a town of 20,000, had not seen a homicide in two
years; at its height, Angelica's murder drew dozens of
investigators into an exhaustive pursuit to solve it. The case
prompted Connecticut's governor, John G. Rowland, to authorize a
$50,000 reward. As the investigation narrowed to Torres, police put
his apartment under constant surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who was working for a local bungee cord maker, knew
Angelica and her mother; he was a customer at Angelica's uncle's
jewelry store. But the family and most of their neighbors did not
know a key fact about Torres: He had been released from prison last
year after serving time for sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The information on Torres and other criminal sex offenders was
available to anyone who had sought it at the Willimantic Police
Department. A few did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can count them on one hand,'' said Lieutenant Paul Decarli.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the past week, the black binder that had lain
almost dormant became a crucial piece of the investigation, and it
was withheld from the public. The withholding of the sex offender
list touched off protests by public officials across the state and
by parents, and led to an appeal to the Connecticut Freedom of
Information Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, some here say, could end up saving a child: It
has brought more public attention to the list than at any time
since Megan's Law was passed.

US BRINGS NAIROBI BOMBING SUSPECT TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As one tiny unit of a sprawling underground network
of Islamic militants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali went from one
terrorist training ground in Afghanistan to another in preparation
for his mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of Allah, and with the guidance and dollars of Saudi
billionaire Osama bin Laden, Al-'Owhali became expert in the art of
hijacking, kidnapping and explosives before the twin bombings of US
embassies in Africa, believing he would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, Al-'Owhali made it, while 258 people,
including 12 Americans, died, and 5,000 others were injured in the
blast of a bomb he drove to the Nairobi embassy. Indeed, it was
Al-'Owhali who kicked off the Aug. 7 attack, throwing a flash
grenade at a security guard protecting the compound.
</P>
<P>
   This, at least, is the portrait of Al-'Owhali's involvement
sketched by the Clinton administration's highest-ranking law
enforcement officials who announced his arrest and indictment at a
press conference. Attorney General Janet Reno called it the fruit
of ``the most extensive overseas criminal investigation in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh would not detail how many other
suspects are in custody or being questioned about the bombings at
US embassies in Nairobi as well as Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, except
to say that the wide-ranging investigation was still at its
earliest stages. An FBI official, however, confirmed that another
suspect was on the way from Egypt. Officials wouldn't say whether
another suspect released by Kenya, Mohamed Sadiq Odeh had arrived
by Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali was flown from Kenya to New York to face his 14-count
indictment in connection with his role in the bombing of the
Nairobi embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed by FBI special agents and unsealed
Thursday, said the defendant traveled from Lahore, Pakistan to
Nairobi, where he cased the embassy before driving the bomb-laden
vehicle. Injured on his neck, face, and back, he was treated in a
hospital, where he allegedly discarded two keys that fit a padlock
on the back of the vehicle and three cartridges for a gun left in
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, he was apprehended by Kenyan authorities, who turned
him over to US authorities. According to FBI agents, he waived his
right to silence and described his involvement. Freeh specifically
gave thanks _ and credit _ to Kenya and Tanzania for help in the
search and arrest of Al-'Owhali, who was first taken into custody
by Kenyan authorities, and is also known as Khalid Salim Saleh Bin
Rashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cooperation ... has brought us initially to the charge we
will speak about today,'' said Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have linked arms with law enforcement around the world and
vowed as one that justice will be done,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed by FBI special agents, Al-'Owhali
tied the Afghani training camps he attended to Qasda, an
international terrorist organization led by bin Laden, who US
officials believe masterminded the embassy bombings as well as
targeting US soldiers in Somalia and other international attacks.
Bin Laden has repeatedly issued edicts to his followers to target
and kill Americans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali also described the camps as dedicated to opposing
non-Islamic governments with force and violence and that he
attended conferences and meetings with bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 FBI personnel, including bomb technicians and
investigators, are still sorting through the rubble in Nairobi,
working with Kenyan authorities to uncover clues in the bombing.
The embassy in Dar es Salaam, was also bombed on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali's indictment includes charges of premediated murder
of the 12 Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing, conspiracy to
commit murder, and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction
against the US.

AUDIT REPORT CITES CENDANT'S EX-CHAIRMAN

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The audit committee of Cendant Corp. said Thursday in a
long-awaited report that Walter Forbes, its former chairman, bore
some responsibility for the accounting irregularities that wiped
out billions of dollars of Cendant's market value after the
problems were disclosed in April.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, for example, that Forbes failed to create a
corporate culture intolerant of inaccurate financial reporting;
that he failed to put in place appropriate controls and procedures
to catch such problems, and that he failed to inform himself
adequately about the sources of the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who resigned from the company in July and received a
severance package worth more than $35 million, has maintained for
months that he knew nothing about the unusual accounting changes
before they came to light, and, therefore, was not responsible for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The audit committee's report _ based on work by its legal
counsel, Willkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher, as well as the accounting firms
of Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche _ will likely be a case
study for accounting students for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, for example, that ``pervasive'' irregularities,
which created about $500 million before taxes of fictional profits
for the last three years, included inflating operating income,
decreasing expenses and adjusting its balance sheet ``particularly
to show a greater cash balance than the company actually had on its
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the company improperly used funds set aside to
cover the cost of the merger in December of CUC and HFS to create
Cendant. For example, the report said Forbes received $500,000 from
Cendant's merger reserves for ``undercharging'' the company for
trips he took in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Forbes said: ``The audit committee's
investigation is complete and it found absolutely no evidence that
I had any knowledge of or involvement in the accounting
irregularities previously disclosed by Cendant. Any suggestion that
I `should have known' about the fraud is completely unfounded.
There is and was no way I could or should have known about the
fraud and I never did or ever would condone any improper conduct
under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brown, chairman of the accounting department at the Stern
School of Business at New York University, said there had been many
cases of companies' using one or two of these techniques. ``But to
see an organization use a combination of many of them is somewhat
amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the audit report provided a strong example of how the
``tone at the top'' set by senior company officials affects
behavior at all levels. ``If the tone is set in a rather lax
fashion, it is such fodder for fire to sweep through to the next
level and the next level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on many public companies to show steady earnings
growth appears to have influenced Cendant's behavior. The audit
report said that many of the accounting irregularities resulted
from the company's inflating earnings so it would not fall short of
the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If actual income in a particular quarter was 10 cents per
share and consensus analysts' expectations were 18 cents per share,
then adjustments of approximately 8 cents were made, without
support, to increase earnings,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, however, investors have steadily lowered their
expectations after a stream of bad news, and Cendant's shares hit a
new low Thursday of $11.625, before closing at $13.375, down
$1.1875. Cendant's shares have fallen 68 percent since April.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, the former chairman of HFS who is now chairman,
chief executive and president of Cendant, said the company has
``put in place a series of financial controls to ensure these
improprieties cannot occur at Cendant.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement not related to the audit committee
report, Cendant said that it would file its much-anticipated
restated financial statements in late September to reflect changes
requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC
request reflects shifting notions about when companies that rely on
memberships, such as health clubs, should recognize revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Cendant board named a new audit committee Thursday, composed
of four former HFS directors. The board also terminated, for cause,
E. Kirk Shelton, the former president and chief operating officer
of CUC, saying that he, along with Forbes, bore responsibility for
the accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Shelton said that he ``had absolutely no knowledge
of, or involvement in, any improper conduct at CUC or Cendant.''
Because he was terminated for cause, Shelton will not receive any
severance payments.
</P>
<P>
   The report also stated that Cosmo Corigliano, the former chief
financial officer of CUC, and Anne Pember, the former controller of
CUC, directed the accounting irregularities, and that the two
former executives did not make themselves available to the
independent investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Corigliano, said his client was
``shocked that certain Cendant employees have apparently admitted
making improper financial entries and that those employees would
falsely attempt to implicate him in their wrongful conduct.'' He
added that Corigliano ``never engaged in any accounting or
financial wrongdoing or advised anyone else to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Gredd, an attorney for Ms. Pember, was unavailable for
comment, according to her assistant.

REPUBLICANS PLAN HEARINGS ON IRAQ ARMS MONITORING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., N.Y.)  (See also ROSENTHAL-COLUMN, moved in `k' file)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Republicans on the House and Senate foreign
affairs committees said Thursday that they would hold hearings to
determine whether the Clinton administration has weakened
inspection efforts by the U.N. Special Commission directed to
disarm Iraq of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Committee on
International Relations, said they were deeply troubled by
allegations by Scott Ritter, a senior American inspector who
resigned on Wednesday in protest of administration policy and
Security Council inaction on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, 37, a former Marine intelligence officer, said in his
resignation letter and in interviews on Wednesday that the
administration had helped scuttle aggressive inspections by the
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he said, it advised UNSCOM's chairman to defer a
critical inspection that in his view could have produced important
new proof of Iraq's determination to retain weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Several administration officials adamantly denied Ritter's
assertions again Thursday. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
insisted that the administration is ``the foremost supporter'' of
the Special Commission. ``We believe it is absolutely essential for
Saddam Hussein to come clean in terms of weapons of mass
destruction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brownback and a spokesman for Gilman said their hearings
would explore whether the administration's actions matched its
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Ritter's charges ``credible, specific and substantial,''
Brownback said that the administration has shown ``little resolve
in containing Iraq and removing Saddam Hussein from power.''
</P>
<P>
   His hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9. A spokesman for Gilman
said that committee would probably also hold its hearing in early
September.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with reporters Thursday, administration officials
and foreign diplomats supportive of the American position sought to
counter Ritter's charges that his inspections had been stymied on
the verge of uncovering Iraq's hidden weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat said that his government shared Washington's view
that inspections planned by Ritter last July _ one of which he said
targeted President Saddam Hussein's personal office _ would have
been needlessly provocative without providing new information about
Iraq's violations of its disarmament commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that ever since UNSCOM's creation
seven years ago, the United States had fought for greater access to
Iraqi sites, most recently this March, when Ritter conducted a
particularly aggressive inspection at the Iraqi Ministry of
Defense.

 &HT;    Local Serb sued as war criminal
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A Bosnian Serb described as a model employee at a
Tucker compressor plant committed wartime atrocities against Muslim
and Croat prisoners in the former Yugoslavia in 1992, a federal
lawsuit filed in Atlanta charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian refugee Kemal Mehinovic, 42, of Salt Lake City, claims
in the lawsuit that he was repeatedly brutalized by Nikola
Vuckovic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier who now lives in Clarkston.
</P>
<P>
   Mehinovic filed suit after learning from friends that Vuckovic
was living in the Atlanta area, said one of his lawyers, Paul
Hoffman, chairman of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic declines to comment until he consults with a lawyer,
said one of his supervisors, Don Hood, human resources manager of
Our Way Inc. ``He did say, `This is all lies,''' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the first of its kind against a Serbian defendant
living in the United States, Hoffman said. The Alien Tort Claims
Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act allow claims to be
brought against human rights violators found within U.S. borders.
The San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability and
the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia are assisting
Mehinovic in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no safe haven in Georgia for war criminals,''
said Gerald Weber, the ACLU's local legal director.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit details chilling claims of abuse by Vuckovic:
</P>
<P>
   Mehinovic, who co-owned two restaurants and a bakery in his
hometown of Bosanski Samac, was awakened from a mid-day nap by Serb
police on May 27, 1992. They arrested him without a warrant and,
before taking him away, beat him with batons in front of his wife
and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, Mehinovic was repeatedly tortured by
Vuckovic, the lawsuit says. Vuckovic beat Mehinovic ``with metal
pipes, baseball bats, chair legs, wooden batons, his fists and
heavy boots, and at one point forced his legs apart and beat his
genitals, stating, 'You won't be needing this anymore,''' the
lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was beaten with, in his words, anything they could get
their hands on,'' said Shawn Roberts, another of Mehinovic's
lawyers. ``The beatings would last about an hour until he lost
consciousness.'' She said her client had no military or political
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs eventually released Mehinovic in October 1994 in an
exchange near Sarajevo. He reunited with his family and arrived in
the United States in July 1995. Mehinovic travels throughout the
country to perform maintenance work on various buildings, Roberts
said, declining to name his employer.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing himself on U.S. soil, Mehinovic began
``believing he was finally free of his persecutors,'' Roberts said.
But when he learned that Vuckovic was living in the Atlanta area,
he ``began having horrible nightmares and was unable to focus on
his new life in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic was served with the lawsuit, filed Wednesday, where he
works as a laborer at Our Way, a Tucker company that makes
compressors for air conditioners and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic has been a ``model employee,'' said Hood, a supervisor.
He described the Serb as ``very easy going, friendly and very nice.
... I can't stress to you what a good employee he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic described himself as an orthodox Serb whose wife is
Muslim, Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,200 Bosnian refugees live in metro Atlanta,
according to the Center for Applied Research in Anthropology at
Georgia State University. Most are Muslim, but some Serbs married
to Bosnian Muslims are also allowed to enter the United States.
Being in mixed marriages made them possible targets for persecution
in their native land.
</P>
<P>
   Our Way president Bobbie Bailey said her company, which employes
350 people, hired Vuckovic through local church ministries. ``We
always check people out,'' she said. ``We've had good results
working with the church. But we wouldn't have any specific
knowledge about their backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, Serb paramilitary forces, revolting against
Bosnia's declaration of independence from Serbia-controlled
Yugoslavia, took control of Mehinovic's hometown of Bosanski Samac.
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic, a soldier in the Serb Army, arbitrarily detained and
tortured Bosnian Muslims and Croats with the specific intent of
destroying their ethnic-religious groups, the lawsuit claims. He
was a member of the 2nd Posavina Brigade, commanded by Simo Zaric,
and he had regular contact with Stevan Todorovic, the Serb chief of
police, the suit says. Zaric and Todorovic have been indicted for
war crimes by the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   With the lawsuit, said Hoffman, a Los Angeles lawyer, ``We want
to be able to lay out the facts of this case, have a jury listen to
these violations and issue a punishment in the form of civil
damages. We also want the U.S. government to take some action about
a man that has committed these types of crimes (and) that is living
in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman pointed to a similar case filed in Atlanta to show how
difficult it is to get people deported from the United States for
war crimes and human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell awarded three
women $500,000 each in damages against an Ethiopian torturer.
Tidwell said each woman ``clearly established her claims of
torture'' against Kelbessa Negewo, who brutalized them 15 years
before they came to North America.
</P>
<P>
   Negewo, a former bellhop at the Colony Square Hotel, was granted
U.S. citizenship after Tidwell issued the order, said Hoffman, who
represented the women. ``We still can't believe it,'' he said.
``It's outrageous that an agency of the U.S. government would grant
citizenship to someone found liable of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   The women have not collected any money in their judgments
against Negewo, who cannot be located by their lawyers, Hoffman
said. They want the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
revoke Negewo's citizenship, he said.

 &HT;    Bush keeps them lean on the campaign tour
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As John Thrasher boarded the seven seat
King Air, the soon-to-be House Speaker had one thing on his mind as
the plane left St. Petersburg _ Steak and Shake.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know that in the Jeb Bush campaign, food is often
an afterthought. Worse, there was no Steak and Shake ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really hungry,'' Thrasher kept saying with a smile and a
certain degree of determination. ``I didn't have dinner last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning had already been spent touring a technical education
school in St. Petersburg as part of a two-day, six city, fly-around
that Bush's campaign had organized with the intention of grabbing a
spot on the evening news. Campaign press secretary Cory Tilley kept
careful score of the news coverage and as the trip began reaching
the end, Bush had managed to be interviewed by nearly every major
television station in the state.
</P>
<P>
   As Thrasher grew hungrier, Bush, who was traveling with his
running mate, Commissioner of Education Frank Brogan, just couldn't
pull himself away from the adult students at the technical
education school.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bush got to Westwood Elementary School in West Palm
Beach, Tilley was anxiously looking at his watch. They had to be in
Fort Myers by 2 p.m. and they were getting behind schedule. There
would be sandwiches on the plane but Thrasher couldn't wait any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush chatted with kids and read the book Rat-a-tat-tat to
a group of first-graders, Thrasher began thinking about the school
cafeteria where they were supposed to join the kids for lunch but
the campaign staff really wanted to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in line with the kids, Thrasher filled his tray with
chicken and rice, black beans and a slice of cake. The Jacksonville
Republican proclaimed it ``great, fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made the evening news. Thrasher had lunch. And the plane
took off only a few minutes late for Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush win and become governor, he's learned an important
lesson about Thrasher, Bush said with a laugh. ``If I have to
negotiate with him, I just won't feed him until he gives in.''

 &HT;    Memories kindle civil rights candle for new generation
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Thirty-five years ago, Jack Hughes left his
white, middle-class community outside Dayton, Ohio, for the streets
of the nation's capital to protest the lack of opportunity and
equality for African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of that day Thursday, Hughes shook the hand
of Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, the only major speaker at
that historic march still alive, and cried.
</P>
<P>
   He cried because in hearing Lewis speak again, he realized how
far the movement had come since that march in Washington, the day
that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ``I have a Dream''
speech. He cried because of what he believes is left to do if the
social barriers between blacks and whites are to be removed
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll take another 500 years, but it will happen,''
said the 70-year-old Hughes, who now lives in Providence. ``That
march really changed my life. I became a lot more active in trying
to get rid of prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis came to Providence at the invitation of Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.), son of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). Lewis and
the younger Kennedy joined forces at the tiny Sheldon Street
Church, a multiracial church built by an immigrant more than 90
years ago, to mark the anniversary of the march and to spark
discussions about the current state of race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came over here on different ships, but we all live in
the same boat now,'' Lewis told the packed, racially mixed audience
at the church. He said that if someone had told him 35 years ago
that he would be standing at the podium of a church talking to such
a mixed audience, he wouldn't have believed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell all of you, don't give up, don't give in,'' Lewis said.
``Keep your eye on the prize. Let's create an interracial democracy
in America, let's walk into the wind and let the spirit of history
be our guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the legal barriers of segregation have been removed,
the country should focus on tearing down the less obvious walls of
racism, Kennedy said. For example, the focus should be on how to
improve public schools and housing in African-American
neighborhoods and how to make sure that blacks have an equal chance
at economic success through bank loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is more of a challenge in some ways because the
prejudice is not so black and white,'' said Kennedy. ``It requires
challenging a culture and changing belief systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a speech that his late uncle Robert F. Kennedy
delivered in Cape Town, South Africa, during the years of
apartheid, the younger Kennedy said eliminating racism from society
comes from changing individual attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only from calling on us to change individually that we
can change as a collective whole,'' Kennedy said. The anniversary
of the march should ``cause a pause for reflection in society and
challenge us as individuals. ... I think the burden is not on the
African-Americans or other minorities. The burden rests on the
majority of white Americans to lead the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Lewis speak, Terri Anderson and her son, Benjamin,
10, stood at the entrance of the church, unraveling the meaning of
his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said meant so much to me,'' said Anderson, who is
white and married to a black man. ``I wanted my son to hear
first-hand about the civil rights movement, hear first-hand about
the struggle they had to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin looked up at his mother. ``The message I learned is
that I have rights,'' he said softly. ``And I have to fight to keep
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the posh dining room of the Citizens Bank Building
overlooking the city, Lewis signed copies of his book ``Walking
with the Wind,'' a memoir of his journey from a childhood spent
preaching to chickens and picking cotton in rural Alabama to his
present position as the highest-ranking African-American in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Montiero, an official of the Providence chapter of the
NAACP, who marched with Lewis 35 years ago, said the division
between the races still exists, in part from African-American
groups' excluding whites from the process of healing racial wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like asking people with cancer to find a cure for
cancer,'' Montiero said. ``We need to address this as a society.
It's an American problem.''

 &HT;    Russians rushing to empty banks
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON. Ohio -- Everyday lately, Kevin Begin of Dayton leaves
his Moscow apartment for work and sees between 200 and 400 people
lined up outside his Russian neighborhood banks desperate to get
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the banks don't have any cash and it's a cash
economy,'' said Begin, who works for Centerville's Hayden
Associates, an engineering firm that built three wastewater
treatment plants in Russia for Pepsi Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   The run on the banks is only one sign of the economic turmoil in
Russia. The ruble is losing value and the Russian Central Bank
halted dollar sales for the second consecutive day Thursday.
Western corporations have difficulty getting cash to their
employees. And the Kremlin vehemently denied rumors Thursday that
President Boris Yeltsin had resigned or made provisions for his
resignation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a state of panic. Russians take everything with a
grain of salt. They are used to instability,'' Begin said Thursday
from Moscow. ``But there is concern. Russians love their children
also and they want to feed them just like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a poorer country than most Americans realize, Begin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is unstable. The economy is plunging. The ruble
is plunging. People here live on $200 a month, and when you have to
pay American prices on $200 a month (it's difficult,)'' Begin said.
``Everything is imported. Russia makes nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin, 44, plans to spend another two or three months in Moscow
where he is training operators and testing equipment for Pepsi's
new wastewater treatment plant. But if the country becomes
unstable, he may return in two or three weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hayden, project engineer for Hayden Associates, said
his company has been there off and on for two years and is now
completing the last of three wastewater treatment plants. He and
his partners are trying to figure out a way to get cash to Begin so
he can pay his rent, Hayden said. Hayden plans to return to Moscow
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Flannery, director of international operations for
TransWave International Inc. in Dayton, said his company has
$400,000 in sales lined up in Russia. TransWave sells equipment to
monitor and maintain pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery is taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Russian
economy and political situation because even though things are
down, Flannery says the country hasn't hit rock bottom yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can almost always sink lower there,'' said Flannery who has
masters degrees in Russian history and contemporary Russian studies
and has lived and worked in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is glad to hear Yeltsin is still in power. ``The
status quo is better than the unknown. It's as simple as that,''
Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and his economic reformers have deadlocked with the
communists dominating the Russian legislature, Flannery said.
Russia has few economic engines and the government is ineffective
at collecting and spending tax revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disgusted. They don't know what to do. But the
status quo is better (than the unknown,)'' Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations have moved into Russia and the newly
independent states to do business since the fall of the Iron
Curtain in 1991.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As one tiny unit of a sprawling underground network
of Islamic militants, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali went from one
terrorist training ground in Afghanistan to another in preparation
for his mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of Allah, and with the guidance and dollars of Saudi
billionaire Osama bin Laden, Al-'Owhali became expert in the art of
hijacking, kidnapping and explosives before the twin bombings of US
embassies in Africa, believing he would not survive.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, Al-'Owhali made it, while 258 people,
including 12 Americans, died, and 5,000 others were injured in the
blast of a bomb he drove to the Nairobi embassy. Indeed, it was
Al-'Owhali who kicked off the Aug. 7 attack, throwing a flash
grenade at a security guard protecting the compound.
</P>
<P>
   This, at least, is the portrait of Al-'Owhali's involvement
sketched by the Clinton administration's highest-ranking law
enforcement officials who announced his arrest and indictment at a
press conference. Attorney General Janet Reno called it the fruit
of ``the most extensive overseas criminal investigation in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh would not detail how many other
suspects are in custody or being questioned about the bombings at
US embassies in Nairobi as well as Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, except
to say that the wide-ranging investigation was still at its
earliest stages. An FBI official, however, confirmed that another
suspect was on the way from Egypt. Officials wouldn't say whether
another suspect released by Kenya, Mohamed Sadiq Odeh had arrived
by Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali was flown from Kenya to New York to face his 14-count
indictment in connection with his role in the bombing of the
Nairobi embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed by FBI special agents and unsealed
Thursday, said the defendant traveled from Lahore, Pakistan to
Nairobi, where he cased the embassy before driving the bomb-laden
vehicle. Injured on his neck, face, and back, he was treated in a
hospital, where he allegedly discarded two keys that fit a padlock
on the back of the vehicle and three cartridges for a gun left in
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, he was apprehended by Kenyan authorities, who turned
him over to US authorities. According to FBI agents, he waived his
right to silence and described his involvement. Freeh specifically
gave thanks _ and credit _ to Kenya and Tanzania for help in the
search and arrest of Al-'Owhali, who was first taken into custody
by Kenyan authorities, and is also known as Khalid Salim Saleh Bin
Rashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cooperation ... has brought us initially to the charge we
will speak about today,'' said Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have linked arms with law enforcement around the world and
vowed as one that justice will be done,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed by FBI special agents, Al-'Owhali
tied the Afghani training camps he attended to Qasda, an
international terrorist organization led by bin Laden, who US
officials believe masterminded the embassy bombings as well as
targeting US soldiers in Somalia and other international attacks.
Bin Laden has repeatedly issued edicts to his followers to target
and kill Americans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali also described the camps as dedicated to opposing
non-Islamic governments with force and violence and that he
attended conferences and meetings with bin Laden.

   More than 300 FBI personnel, including bomb technicians and

EMBASSY BOMBING SUSPECT ARRAIGNED IN NEW YORK

   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities brought a suspect in the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the United
States on Thursday, saying he had admitted that he was trained at
terror camps in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi born
multi-millionaire suspected of having directed the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, was said to have
acknowledged that he rode as a passenger in the truck that carried
the massive bomb to the Nairobi, Kenya, embassy, according to a
detailed criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in U.S. District
Court in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was also said to have told investigators that he threw a
dummy grenade at a security guard seconds before the blast and then
prepared to die in a bombing that he said was designed as a
``martyrdom operation in which he did not expect to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fragments from the blast left a large wound in his back and cuts
on his hands and face, but he survived. And Thursday, the slight,
bearded man with a bandage on one wrist was brought by FBI agents
from Nairobi to a U.S. courtroom in New York. U.S. Magistrate
Sharon Grubin informed him of the charges against him, including
conspiracy to commit murder, the use of a weapon of mass
destruction and 12 counts of murder, one each for the dozen
Americans who died in the Nairobi bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali is not the only suspect headed for a U.S. court, law
enforcement officials said Thursday. He will be followed Friday by
a second man, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who has been in custody in
Nairobi for nearly two weeks. Odeh provided one of the first
breakthroughs in the case, after he was initially detained on a
flight from Nairobi to Karachi, Pakistan, on Aug. 7, the day of the
bombings. Pakistani officials have said that Odeh provided
extensive details of his role in the plot. But pending his arrival
in New York, federal officials would would not discuss the case
against Odeh in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the decision to bring the two suspects
to New York was related to the sealed grand jury indictment
returned against bin Laden in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That federal grand jury is expected to hear evidence about the
bombings and may return a superseding indictment that would be used
to bring prosecutions in New York against those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Any statements to U.S. authorities by Odeh or Al-'Owhali could
be presented to the grand jury as evidence against bin Laden, who
came under federal investigation after the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993. Officials said the sealed indictment of bin Laden
was issued before the East Africa bombings and that it charges him
with several terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, FBI Director Louis Freeh would
not discuss bin Laden's legal status nor would he comment on
reports that the indictment accused bin Laden of plotting to kill
President Clinton in 1994 during a visit to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali first emerged as a possible suspect when Kenyan
authorities contacted him two days after the Nairobi bombing,
according to a federal complaint signed by FBI Agent Daniel
Coleman. He was arrested the same day and confessed to taking part
in the plot during two interviews with FBI investigators on Aug. 12
and Aug. 20, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   He told investigators he traveled from Lahore, Pakistan, to
Kenya on July 31. With several unidentified confederates he went to
the embassy Aug. 4, three days before the bombing, to inspect the
buildings and grounds in preparation for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the bombing, the complaint said, Al-'Owhali, along
with another man, traveled in a truck carrying a huge homemade bomb
from an undisclosed location in Kenya to the embassy. The identity
of the driver or whether he survived was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali first told Kenyan authorities _ apparently while he
was in a hospital _ that he had been wounded while standing on an
embankment with a friend as the explosion occurred. But the Kenyans
were suspicious because he said he was wearing the clothes he wore
at the time the blast, although they showed no traces of blood from
his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Kenyans that he had thrown away in a hospital
bathroom two keys that fit a padlock on the rear of the bomb-laden
vehicle and three bullets from a gun he had left behind in the
truck. Hospital employees later retrieved the keys and bullets from
the area that Al-'Owhali described.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali told the investigators that he had been trained in a
number of camps in Afghanistan, including ``camps affiliated with
Al Qaeda, an international terrorist group, led by bin Laden.'' At
the bin Laden camps, Al-'Owhali said he was trained in the tools of
terror, including explosives, hijacking and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews recounted in the complaint, Al-'Owhali
said he attended conferences and meetings with bin Laden and knew
of an order, signed by bin Laden and other militants saying that
American civilians were legitimate targets of terrorist acts. In
the Kenya and Tanzania bombings, more than 258 people died and more
than 5,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant was flown to a military airport in upstate New
York on Wednesday night and taken by helicopter under heavy guard
to FBI headquarters in Manhattan. He was being held in a federal
prison next to the U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, Al-'Owhali also completed a financial affidavit,
in support of an application for a court appointed lawyer. In it,
he said he was unmarried, had no home and had never been employed.
But he reported that he had $12,000 from his father and owned a
1992 Chevrolet Caprice. Al-'Owhali had been identified as Yemeni
citizen, but officials in Yemen denied this.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of laws which make it a federal crime to carry
out terrorist attacks overseas, Al-'Owhali could face a maximum
sentence of death or life in prison. Al-'Owhali's was ordered held
in jail pending a hearing Sept. 28. His court appointed lawyer,
Yuanchung Lee, would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at FBI headquarters, senior law enforcement
and diplomatic officials in Washington hailed the action as an
important victory in the U.S. war against terrorism, in large part
because they had succeeded in bringing a suspect in an overseas
attack from Africa into a U.S. court within 20 days of the bombing
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said Thursday that no decision had made on where to try
Al-'Owhali, Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York, appeared
at a news conference at FBI headquarters, suggesting that any
defendants in the bombing plot would probably be tried in New York.

   NEW YORK _ After learning Thursday that two suspects in the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya would be detained and
prosecuted in New York City, city officials announced immediate
plans to increase security in a section of lower Manhattan
dominated by court and municipal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that most of the measures would be
modest. But he acknowledged that a few of them, including the
erection of barricades and the closing of a portion of Pearl
Street, would cause some complications for traffic and pedestrians
_ annoyances that he sought to place in some context.
</P>
<P>
   ``As citizens, we all pay some degree of a price to live in a
free and democratic country,'' he said Thursday afternoon. ``And
the burdens of this and the patience that people have to have in
order to endure is well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on the Thursday, federal officials announced that
Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali had been brought to Manhattan on
Wednesday night, but they declined to reveal the location of a
second suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh. The two, both of whom have
ties to a financial supporter of Islamic militants, Osama bin
Laden, are suspected of having taken part in the Aug. 7 bombing of
the embassy in Nairobi that killed at least 247 people, including
12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were informed of the decision as they were bringing the
people back,'' Giuliani said. ``The city has to react to it. And we
will. We will react to it. We're part of America, and the United
States should prosecute these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the United States bombed what it said were
terrorist-linked locations in Afghanistan and the Sudan _ in
response to bombings in Kenya and Tanzania _ the mayor announced
that the city had increased security around courthouses, embassies
and other buildings that might be likely terrorist targets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With Thursday's developments, city officials said they would
increase security around the U.S. Court House in lower Manhattan.
That courthouse, a majestic building at 500 Pearl St.that sits amid
other public buildings, including the detention facility where the
suspects are likely to be held while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, workers using forklifts began placing cement
barriers behind police headquarters near the court house. A dump
truck loaded with sand was parked at the corner of Pearl Street and
Park Row, blocking traffic from passing the jail where al-'Owhali
is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for anyone to be alarmed,'' the mayor said.
He added that the city is ``just taking reasonable precautions,
reasonable steps, to protect against the possible problems that
could occur.''

LATIN MARKETS PLUNGE, CREATING NEW FEARS FOR WORLD ECONOMY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock markets in Latin America plunged Thursday,
raising more doubts about whether the region will be able to
survive the economic crisis that has swamped Asia and is now
pulling Russia to its knees. Currency declines in Mexico and the
fear of a devaluation in Brazil is also adding pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not only important to the governments and citizens
of Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, who have fought back with
economic reforms since the drubbing they took in the wake of the
Mexican peso devaluation in 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is also a region whose consumers are big buyers of
American exports and and if their pace slows down that will put
another drag on the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico alone is one of America's top three export markets and
the plunge of the peso to record lows is surely going to curb
Mexican buying, as the weaker peso raises the cost of American
goods. The peso has fallen 10 percent in value since the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``If emerging markets get weaker, that takes away a leg from
under U.S. corporate earnings,'' said Christopher Alderson, head of
emerging markets at Rowe Price Fleming in London.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the Bovespa index dropped 10 percent and is now down
39.5 percent since the end of July. In Mexico, the chief market
index fell 6.1 percent and is off 34.6 percent since July 17, the
day that the Dow Jones industrial average hit its recent record
high. Argentina's Merval index fell 10.6 percent and the Venezuelan
stock market index dropped 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the equity selling in Latin America, analysts said
Thursday, is being forced by the need of hedge funds to raise cash
to pay off loans they took out to make big bets in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As fast as stock markets are falling, Latin American bond
markets are keeping up, which is forcing interest rates higher.
According to the J.P. Morgan emerging market bond index, the
difference, or spread, between the rates on U.S. Treasuries and
those on Latin American governments bonds is 13 percentage points,
putting rates on long-term Latin American bonds at over 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This surge in rates since the beginning of August will add to a
countries borrowing costs and, more importantly, will make it
harder for Latin American countries to rollover their current
foreign debt as it comes due in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the focus in the near term will be on Brazil. Alderson
said that Brazil has around $50 billion in short-term debt that has
to be refinanced over the next several months, a task that will not
be more difficult. And as the time for rollovers approaches,
international investors are likely to get more jittery.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also critical to the outlook for all emerging markets
because it is seen as the country that is the most vulnerable to a
currency devaluation. The devaluation is Russia, which economically
is less important than Brazil, has sent a shock wave through
emerging markets. A Brazilian devaluation would probably do much
more damage.
</P>
<P>
   The rout in Latin America Thursday was mirrored in other
emerging markets. In Eastern Europe, the stock market in Hungry
plunged 14.4 percent, the market in Poland dropped 6.1 percent and
the main index in the Czech Republic fell 6.8 percent. The RTS
index in Russia plunged 17.1 percent and is off 84 percent for they
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the key emerging markets were off much less, falling in
the 1 percent range. But that may have been because they were
closed before the full brunt of the negative news from Russia
Thursday.

BY EVERY MEASURE, THE LOSSES ARE HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MARKET, MARKET-LOSSES, MARKET-INVESTORS,

RUSSIA-EMERGE)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By almost every measure, share prices have been
suffering some of the worst declines in more than a decade, racking
up huge paper losses for millions of investors in a month of
volatile and tempestuous trading.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for instance, the Dow Jones industrial average, the
most widely followed market barometer, fell 357.36 points, or
nearly 4.2 percent, the 15th-largest one-day decline in percentage
terms since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   It was so volatile that a year ago, the drop would have halted
trading on the Big Board and the Nasdaq for at least half an hour
during the day because of ``circuit breaker'' rules that called for
investors to be given a breather after such a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules, however, were modified after the Dow tumbled 554
points on Oct. 27, 1997. Now it would now take a fall of 900
points, or about 11 percent, for trading to be halted. A drop of 10
percent or more has occurred just twice, in October 1929 and
October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In October last year, the Dow plummeted 7.2 percent on its way
to a 13.2 percent decline from a high reached in early August 1997.
The Dow rallied, however, soaring in early 1998 and reaching a new
high, 9,337.97, last month, which prompted talk of the Dow
surpassing 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But rapidly eroding corporate earnings growth and global
economic crises in places like Japan and Russia have helped send
the Dow into a nasty spiral, which ended Thursday at 8,165.99 _
about 12.5 percent below its all-time high, well past the 10
percent decline marker that many Wall Street analysts consider a
``correction.'' The Dow had been hovering around the 10 percent
line for several weeks before Thursday's selloff pierced it. A drop
of 20 percent or more from an all-time high, many analysts say,
would constitute a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts were quick to point out that the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, another widely followed measure, is still
up 7.4 percent this year, and the Dow is up 3.3 percent, in line or
slightly ahead of many projections for this year. But the carnage
of the last few weeks paints a bleak picture. Of the companies that
make up the S&AMP;P 500, for example, more than half are down for the
year, meaning that huge gains in a select few large companies are
masking a nastier downturn in the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the Russell 2000 index, a measure of smaller
company stocks, which is down 16.7 percent this year and more than
21 percent from its July high, which seems to suggest a wide swath
of smaller stocks have already entered a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   And while many expected a mild summer of trading, July was the
heaviest trading month in history on the New York Stock Exchange,
with more than 14 billion shares changing hands; August is on pace
to surpass that figure, with about 13.3 billion shares traded
already and two trading sessions left. Thursday, more than 936
million shares changed hands, the second-highest volume day ever on
the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key components to this summer's downturn has been
volatility, the gigantic price swings that Wall Street analysts
fear could unnerve investors worldwide. Almost every other day, the
Dow and other indexes seem to have price swings of 1 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
   August is also shaping up to be an ugly precursor to bad
Octobers. In 1990, an steep selloff of 10 percent in August
pre-dated a sharp September and October drop. And declines last
August sent the market into an October swoon. This August, the Dow
is down 8.1 percent, one of the worst monthly declines of the
decade.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   American scientists claim they've found the bit of the human
brain that decides whether or not a thing is worth remembering.
Though lots of brain areas hum into action when looking at a view
or a photograph, it's only the right pre-frontal lobe that decides
whether or not to log it in the memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   That at least accounts for President Clinton's selective memory
for what he gives young women. It's because of his right
pre-frontal that he's still being asked about the dress, the
brooch, the hatpin and the volume of Walt Whitman's poetry that he
allegedly gave Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's not prevarication or mendacity that he's guilty of here,
just that darned wayward lobe.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the gifts Clinton ``could have given'' the lovely
Monica, the most significant is that volume of poems. There's an
eerie conjunction between the shaggy-bearded seer of American
letters and the clean-cut lothario of the Oval Office that has not
been properly explored until now.
</P>
<P>
   The President's admiration for Whitman goes beyond a literary
appreciation of his immensely long, meandering rhapsodies of
Americana. Clinton also gave his wife a volume of Whitman as a
wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible he dishes out Walt's collected works to any
females he feels attracted to, as a warning of what they may expect
to encounter at his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's most famous poem is ``Song Of Myself,'' an epic burst
of crowing narcissism. It doesn't take much hindsight to see how
Clinton might identify with it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Whitman actually asks, ``Have you outstripped the
rest? Are you the President?'' And we can imagine Bill striding the
swirly carpet of the White House, book in hand, nodding vigorously,
before going on to the section containing the words, ``Divine am I
inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that, girls? There's nothing grubby or degrading about
anything you may be asked to do, since the presidential droit de
seigneur enables it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've read Christopher Hitchens' revelations about what
Clinton and Monica got up to in private _ the ``unconsummated oral
sex'' she performed on his clothed and vertical frame, followed by
Lewinsky's stepping back, removing her kit and doing a little dance
to encourage her inamorata to pleasure himself _ may marvel at the
one-sided nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that she's told the grand jury how he fondled her both
upstairs and down (as I'm afraid we used to say in our teens), you
may wonder why he didn't go the whole hog.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is also in Whitman's poem. ``I merely
stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,'' he writes. ``To
touch my person to someone else's is about as much as I can
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes startlingly relevant, as Whitman/Clinton
describes someone performing nameless indignities on him: ``On all
sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs / straining the udder
of my heart for its withheld drip / behaving licentious toward me,
taking no denial... Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare
waist...''
</P>
<P>
   Blimey! There's even a moment when, pre-climatically, he cries,
``Enough! Enough! Enough!... Stand back!'' _ as Clinton undoubtedly
directed his raven-haired intern.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a poem that doubled as an instruction manual
in the erotic proclivities of the First Philanderer, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   How poignant that it even prefigures his own remorseful
confession _ that ever after he was so comprehensively shafted by
Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Lewinsky herself, he had to admit it
was his own fault.
</P>
<P>
   How do those other lines of Whitman go? ``I am given up by
traitors, I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
the greatest traitor.'' &QL;

CLINTON AVOIDS CONTROVERSY IN SPEECH OUTING

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. -- President Clinton, embarking on perhaps the
most difficult resurrection campaign of his career, ventured
Thursday into this Massachusetts Democratic stronghold, where he
received rousing support from rank and file supporters but a
measured reception from some of the state's leading politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Even while a crowd at Mechanics Hall roared its approval and
others lined the roadways to wave at Clinton's passing limousine,
state officials said they were withholding judgment on his
political viability. Most notably aloof was Sen. John Kerry, who
pointedly passed up a chance to offer his personal support, saying:
``I'm not going to make any judgments on anything until I read the
Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a note sounded repeatedly and to varying degrees on a day
when Clinton himself made no mention of his personal troubles or
the political crisis that has enveloped his presidency. As applause
filled the air all around them, the state's Democratic politicians
said they supported Clinton's issue stands and praised his policy
successes, but tried to distance themselves from his personal
problems by saying they will await the report from independent
counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people still recognize he's the leader, and he has a
personal problem that has to be addressed,'' said Rep. Joseph
Moakley, a Democrat from South Boston who attended the event. ``And
when (the Starr report) comes, we will address it. We have to
decide individually, by looking at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he wished Clinton had apologized in his Aug. 17 speech
during which he confessed his adulterous affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky, Moakley flatly added: ``Most people were looking for him
to be more contrite.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, in his first significant public appearance since he
delivered that speech, Clinton met with an enthusiastic reception
in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by about four to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out the door of his small jet on the tarmac of the
Worcester airport, Clinton beamed and waved to the crowd of
schoolchildren who squealed and yelled in unison. Sunshine poured
down, and Clinton's smile -- his entire demeanor -- seemed in sharp
contrast to the melancholy air he has carried during his rare
public outings on his Martha's Vineyard vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton seemed to like being in Worcester so much that
he later made an unscheduled stop at Scano's, an Italian bakery and
lunch shop, where he stripped off his coat, took up a booth in the
corner and ordered what the proprietor described as a steak bomb,
hold the cheese. In the middle of what is supposed to be his summer
vacation, he sat in the restaurant for over an hour and a half
talking with the locals and the politicians who accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton first pulled into town, driving down Pleasant Street,
hundreds if not thousands of residents turned out to greet his
passing motorcade, some of them holding welcoming signs, others
not.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the Blessed Sacrament Church, a man held a bumper
sticker aloft proclaiming, ``Impeach Clinton Now.'' On the sidewalk
outside of Dooley's dry cleaner, several people unfurled a banner
that said, ``Monica should have had her dress cleaned here.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mechanics Hall, the event was part policy speech on school
safety, and part pep rally. Outside, a couple of hundred protesters
held signs in the air and chanted for Clinton's resignation.
Inside, two officials in particular made a tacit note of Clinton's
problems and tried to brush them off. Rep. Jim McGovern, who is
involved in a reelection campaign against Republican state Sen.
Matthew Amorello, told the crowd, and Clinton, that Worcester
remained behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a city of fair-weathered friends,'' McGovern said.
``A friend from Worcester is a friend for life, and you, Mr.
President, through your policies, have been a friend of
Worcester.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, biting his lower lip, mouthed the words `Thank you,
Jim.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Edward Gardella, the city's police chief, seemed to nearly
bring Clinton to tears when he said, ``We can certainly be proud
that William Jefferson Clinton is our president.''
</P>
<P>
   But their remarks stood in contrast to the sentiments expressed
by others. Attorney General Scott Harshbarger gave a policy speech
most memorable for its lack of energy, and Kerry's only real
reference to Clinton, who sat on the stage behind him, came when he
said, ``We welcome your central leadership on these vital issues
before the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who has faced his own personal problems throughout his
political career, seemed more forgiving and tried pointing his
speech, as well as private comments beforehand, toward policy
rather than politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to get on, want to move on,'' he said. ``They want
a president who will lead on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's most senior Democratic politicians turned
out to lend Clinton a symbolic but important nod of support at the
most difficult time in his political career. Kennedy was the first
to greet Clinton on the tarmac of the Worcester airport, followed
by Kerry, Reps. Moakley, McGovern, Richard Neal and Ed Markey. The
mayor of Worcester, Raymond Mariano, spoke of Clinton warmly in his
public address.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowds, the many members of the public seemed ready to
offer some measure of forgiveness. ``I don't want to hear about it
any more,'' said Barbara Perotto, the wife of a Worcester city
council member. Said Donna Swanstrom of Worcester: ``Other people
do things similar to what he did and they don't get fired for it.
Let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times at the Mechanics Hall event, Clinton received a
standing ovation. On the stage, he seemed to glow in the applause
and the klieg lights, waving at the crowd with a broad smile
splashed across his face. His speech, however, stuck to a
well-trodden topic for him: school safety. His rambling speech
including an offer of money for states to continue with a police
recruitment program using college tuition inducements.
</P>
<P>
   He also touched on other aspects of his policy agenda, including
environmental protection, preserving Social Security and campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is critical business ahead of us _ business that we will
take up as soon as Congress comes back to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted with glee over the trip. ``The president
was very pleased,'' said Clinton spokesman Barry Toiv. ``He really
enjoyed the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some political strategists questioned the wisdom of his
trip, and Massachusetts Republicans said they were thrilled to have
Clinton in their state during an election season, given the
personal and political baggage he carried with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a trip like this so soon after everything that happened
in Washington just exposes everyone to more pain when they should
be doing some healing,'' said Michael Cudahy, an independent
political consultant. ``It looks to me like it's terribly
political.''
</P>
<P>
   Cudahy added: ``I can't believe Jim McGovern is thrilled to have
him in Worcester right now. I think it's very self serving and I
think he's hoping for good pictures and get in and out and prove to
his political base that he's still viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Amorello, McGovern's opponent in the autumn election: ``I
think it's a thrill to have the president visit your hometown, but
given the circumstances surrounding this visit, I would not be on a
podium with him because of his repugnant behavior and that he lied
to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people of Worcester seemed to disagree. Mary Scano,
of the restaurant and bakery Scanos, was at St. Joseph's Catholic
Church when her husband, Mauro, raced inside saying, ``Mary, Mary,
the president wants to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   She rushed back to her shop to have an audience with the
president, and later said, ``He is a great president, and they
ought to cut out this baloney.'' She later added: ``So he lied. I
lie. When I was on the council, I lied.''

SUSPECTED TERRORIST FACES CHARGES IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal lawmen have brought a suspected terrorist
to the United States to face murder and conspiracy charges in the
Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, President
Clinton and his national security team said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, who was captured by Kenyan
officials within three days of the bombing, was flown to the United
States on Wednesday night and arraigned Thursday in the U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, N.Y. The bombing killed 247 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, quoting Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako,
also reported that a second suspected terrorist, Mohammed Sadiq
Odeh, was en route to the United States. However, FBI Director
Louis Freeh would neither confirm nor deny that report.
</P>
<P>
   In its criminal complaint, the Justice Department alleges that
al-'Owhali ``together with others known and unknown, unlawfully,
deliberately, and with malice aforethought, murdered (12) United
States nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the arrest and custody as ``an important step
forward in our struggle against terrorism,'' but he added, ``there
is a long road ahead'' to prevent similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemies of peace and freedom undoubtedly will strike
again. Our resolve must be for the long run,'' Clinton said. ``No
matter what it takes, how long it takes or where it takes us, we
will bring to justice those responsible for the murder and maiming
of American citizens. We will defend our interests, our people and
our values.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, al-'Owhali could face the death penalty or life in
prison without possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Sharon E. Grubin on Thursday ordered
al-'Owhali to be detained pending a Sept. 28 appearance in the
federal district court. The suspected terrorist, listening on
earphones to an Arabic translation of Grubin's comments, nodded his
head as the judge informed him of his rights, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint also alleges that al-'Owhali, a Yemen
native, told FBI agents that he had learned how to make explosives,
hijack and kidnap at terrorist training camps run by Osama bin
Laden, head of the al Qaeda terrorist group. The U.S. military
bombed some of the camps in Afghanistan last week, as well as a
suspected chemical weapons factory in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has blamed bin Laden for ordering the Nairobi bombing
and a similar attack the same day at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. Bin Laden has not been charged in the bombings,
but Freeh called the suspected terrorist ``a primary subject of our
current investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   No Americans were among the 11 people killed in the Tanzania
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, al-'Owhali, also known as Khalid Salim Saleh bin
Rashed, told law enforcement officials that he and an unidentified
conspirator drove a vehicle containing a bomb from an undisclosed
location in Nairobi to the embassy Aug. 7, the federal complaint
states. He tossed a grenade-like device at an embassy guard before
the devastating explosion, which the suspected terrorist said he
did not expect to survive.
</P>
<P>
   While being treated at a local hospital for bomb-related
abrasions to his face, hands and back, al-'Owhali said he disposed
of some evidence in a bathroom receptacle. He said the evidence
included two keys to the padlock on the bomb-laded vehicle and
three bullets for a gun he left in the vehicle. Hospital employees
have recovered these items, the federal complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   Special agents of the FBI interrogated al-'Owhali shortly after
his arrest in Kenya after advising him of his rights under the U.S.
Constitution to remain silent and to seek the advice of an
attorney, the complaint states. He waived his rights before
answering the agents' questions, the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint is based on the sworn statement of FBI
special agent Daniel J. Coleman, who said he based his comments on
his investigation of the bombing and statements from other law
enforcement officials and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they submitted the complaint solely to
establish before the U.S. court that they had probable cause to
arrest the defendant. The officials said they have additional
evidence that has yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said al-'Owhali's arrest and
retrieval was part of the ``most extensive overseas criminal
investigation'' in U.S. history, involving more than 500 U.S. law
enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great wrong has been done, but we are not going to rest,''
Reno said. ``We are going to pursue every last murderer until
justice is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the arrest and
retrieval of al-'Owhali an initial step in establishing ``the full
truth about who planned and perpetrated these cowardly acts of mass
murder.'' She also said the arrest and last week's U.S. bombings in
Afghanistan and Sudan should serve as a warning.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who will lead the federal
government's prosecution of al-'Owhali, said the charges against
him illustrate the United States' commitment to prosecute
``heinous, cowardly acts'' of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation will not end until every terrorist involved
in the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania is identified, taken into
custody and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,'' White
said. ``That is the least that we owe to those who gave their lives
in the service of their country, to those foreign nationals who
died in the mindless violence, and the thousands of others who were
injured.''

WALT WHITMAN'S VERSE TURNS PERVERSE IN OVAL OFFICE

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American scientists claim they've found the bit of the human
brain that decides whether or not a thing is worth remembering.
Though lots of brain areas hum into action when looking at a view
or a photograph, it's only the right pre-frontal lobe that decides
whether or not to log it in the memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   That at least accounts for President Clinton's selective memory
for what he gives young women. It's because of his right
pre-frontal that he's still being asked about the dress, the
brooch, the hatpin and the volume of Walt Whitman's poetry that he
allegedly gave Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's not prevarication or mendacity that he's guilty of here,
just that darned wayward lobe.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the gifts Clinton ``could have given'' the lovely
Monica, the most significant is that volume of poems. There's an
eerie conjunction between the shaggy-bearded seer of American
letters and the clean-cut lothario of the Oval Office that has not
been properly explored until now.
</P>
<P>
   The President's admiration for Whitman goes beyond a literary
appreciation of his immensely long, meandering rhapsodies of
Americana. Clinton also gave his wife a volume of Whitman as a
wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible he dishes out Walt's collected works to any
females he feels attracted to, as a warning of what they may expect
to encounter at his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's most famous poem is ``Song Of Myself,'' an epic burst
of crowing narcissism. It doesn't take much hindsight to see how
Clinton might identify with it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Whitman actually asks, ``Have you outstripped the
rest? Are you the President?'' And we can imagine Bill striding the
swirly carpet of the White House, book in hand, nodding vigorously,
before going on to the section containing the words, ``Divine am I
inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that, girls? There's nothing grubby or degrading about
anything you may be asked to do, since the presidential droit de
seigneur enables it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've read Christopher Hitchens' revelations about what
Clinton and Monica got up to in private _ the ``unconsummated oral
sex'' she performed on his clothed and vertical frame, followed by
Lewinsky's stepping back, removing her kit and doing a little dance
to encourage her inamorata to pleasure himself _ may marvel at the
one-sided nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that she's told the grand jury how he fondled her both
upstairs and down (as I'm afraid we used to say in our teens), you
may wonder why he didn't go the whole hog.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is also in Whitman's poem. ``I merely
stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,'' he writes. ``To
touch my person to someone else's is about as much as I can
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes startlingly relevant, as Whitman/Clinton
describes someone performing nameless indignities on him: ``On all
sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs / straining the udder
of my heart for its withheld drip / behaving licentious toward me,
taking no denial... Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare
waist...''
</P>
<P>
   Blimey! There's even a moment when, pre-climatically, he cries,
``Enough! Enough! Enough!... Stand back!'' _ as Clinton undoubtedly
directed his raven-haired intern.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a poem that doubled as an instruction manual
in the erotic proclivities of the First Philanderer, it's this one.
</P>
<P>
   How poignant that it even prefigures his own remorseful
confession _ that ever after he was so comprehensively shafted by
Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr and Lewinsky herself, he had to admit it
was his own fault.
</P>
<P>
   How do those other lines of Whitman go? ``I am given up by
traitors, I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am
the greatest traitor.'' &QL;

DAVIS CUP HAS BOSTON ORIGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Petra Falk was not jealous, even though her
guy was hugging an old love Thursday at Longwood Cricket Club as
though he'd never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Falk was gracious, realizing that Jonas Bjorkman, the leading
man at the MFS Pro Championships, had been enamored of this
alluring stranger for years, since he was first able to lift a
tennis racket back home in Vaxjo. Long before he met Petra.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Swedes preceding him _ Bjorn Borg, Stefan Edberg, Mats
Wilander among them _ Bjorkman had pursued the shapely stranger
relentlessly across the world, and finally caught up for a
champagne tryst in Moscow four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we drank some champagne together,'' says Bjorkman, who
Friday goes up against the startling French qualifier, Sebastien
Grosjean, in a quarterfinal. ``But since then, we've been apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman, with a No. 12 in the universe, winner of more singles
and doubles matches (111) than any rival last year, caresses the
stranger again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here anyway?'' he coos. ``I thought you
were in Stockholm.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of the Sphinx, another of the world's treasures,
the stranger _ the gleaming, sterling Davis Cup _ generally remains
mute in the presence of adoring humans.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Jenness, who _ along with an armed guard _ squired the
Cup into the clubhouse for a reunion with Bjorkman and another
persistent suitor, Roy Emerson, has the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a homecoming,'' says he, an executive at the jeweler
Shreve Crump &AMP; Low. ``The Davis Cup shouldn't be seen as a stranger
in Boston. Not at all. A Harvard kid named Dwight Davis
commissioned its creation by Shreve's here in 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in Boston, but delivered in Concord, N.H., by
craftsmen selected by Shreve's (William Morton and and Warren
Peckman, on a design by Rowland Rhodes), the Cup has since been
sought by thousands of tennis players in an annual quest for the
world team championship.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in The Bean, and though the aged crock will soon be
99, it has lost none of its luster or sweat appeal to the athletes
yearning to abduct it for their homelands. This year 135 countries
entered the fray, bent on Cup-napping the prize away from Bjorkman
and Sweden. Four survive: Sweden against Spain, the US against
Italy at Milwaukee a month hence.
</P>
<P>
   Because he dipped into his mother's cookie jar for about $1,000
to purchase the Cup and launch his vision of a worldwide
tournament, Dwight Davis was, naturally, the US playing captain in
1900. His Longwood clubmates and fellow Harvards, Holcombe Ward and
Malcolm Whitman, accompanied him to a 3-0 triumph over Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That happened at Longwood, the original Back Bay site at the
corner of Brookline and Longwood Avenues, where the Winsor School
now stands. Three years later, same grass courts, the Brits won and
the Cup was off on its endless globetrotting rounds to such ports
of call as Paris, Santiago, Johannesburg, Sydney, New York,
Goteborg, Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Jenness had taken the beguiling, ornately engraved 15-pound bowl
(13 inches in height, 18 in diameter) from its aluminum traveling
case as Joe Cogan of American Protective Services stood by
discreetly, his revolver out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never knew the Cup needed a bodyguard,'' says Roy Emerson. An
MFS celebrity guest, Hall of Famer Emmo was the principal in eight
Australian Cup heists between 1959 and 1967. ``Long time no see,''
he smooches the stranger, once a photo-op cradle for his baby son,
Antony Emerson in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of great parties _ beer or champagne _ drinking
from the Cup,'' he recalls. No bodyguards, no guns in his day, but
Emmo reckons a few people got blasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Jenness, ``the Cup is insured for $250,000. It
would probably cost that to duplicate it, but it's really
irreplaceable. A work of art of a bygone era. You couldn't find the
craftsmen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shreve's is working on a new, larger base to accommodate the
victors' names as the Cup prepares for a new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be ready for the final in November,'' says Jenness.
``But, Jonas,'' he tells Bjorkman, ``the Cup has been in our
workrooms. That's why you haven't seen it in Sweden since you beat
the US last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins this year, the Cup, not seen at Longwood
in a quarter-century, will be no stranger next year. Marking its
100th year of existence will be a July 17-19 Cup joust, the US
against an opponent to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased to be part of Boston's great 1999 summer
along with the All-Star Game and the Ryder Cup,'' says Longwood
president Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman, winning the decisive doubles with Jan Apell, first
snuggled with the Cup after the 1994 victory over Russia, a
spectating disappointment for a local hacker named Boris Yeltsin.
Last year he won two singles and the doubles in the 5-0 bageling of
the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' says Bjorkman. But he obediently ends the embrace
because the patient, forgiving Petra Falk wants to see Boston and
have lunch at Quincy Market.

MUSTER TURNS ON THE PRESSURE, DEFEATS LAPENTTI

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It hasn't been the best of years for Thomas
Muster. He hasn't won a tournament, although he has reached one
final, at Estorial, Portugal, where he lost in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   Muster, 30, has seen his ATP ranking drop: He was No. 9 when
last year's schedule concluded, now he's No. 24. He won $2.1
million last year, but he's up to just over $400,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Muster had little trouble in doing away with
Nicolas Lapentti, Ecuador's best player, 6-2, 6-4, in the second
round of the MFS Pro Championships Thursdayat Longwood Cricket
Club. Lapentti, ranked 57th, had trouble with Muster, who is strong
on clay as well as hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fighter, he fights you for every point,'' said
Lapentti, 22. ``He's never going to give you a free point so you
have to go out there and have a very positive attitude and be ready
to play for three hours. On hardcourt or on clay, he's very
difficult to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In Muster's words, this has been an ``average'' year for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys would be happy with what I've done this year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 players 30 or older have cracked the top 10 in the men's
pro rankings, but Muster, who is one of them, doesn't think age is
a factor yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm 30,'' he said. ``I can still play with
guys 10-12 years younger than me. I don't think I have a problem
with anyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for a guy who has been there for so long to
maintain a certain level,'' Lapentti said. ``He's been around and
sometimes it's not easy to motivate himself after all he's done in
his career. He's a fighter and he's still trying to get up there.
He's never going to be easy to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Muster's 44 career titles, 40 have been on clay _ tops among
active players. Muster is third among active players in career
titles, and second to Boris Becker in matches won (701-611). He's
had three hardcourt titles, including the Lipton last year in Key
Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take my results the last two years and I would say I'm a
hardcourt guy,'' Muster said. ``I don't know who brought up clay,
even though I've won most of my tournaments on clay and most of my
matches have been on clay, as well as my best results.''
</P>
<P>
   Muster feels he is preparing well for next week's US Open, in
which he will play 15th-ranked Alberto Berasategui in the opening
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming together slowly; I feel all right,'' he said.
``For me, it's important to get matches, and during this stay in
the States, I've had six matches and that's pretty good going into
the Open. That's plenty of practice games.''
</P>
<P>
   In other matches at Longwood Thursday, Cedric Pioline, ranked
17th, decked No. 52 Andrew Ilie, 6-4, 6-3, and Gianluca Pozzi, the
oldest player on the tour at 34, defeated Lionel Roux, 5-7, 6-2,
7-6 (7-3), in 2 hours and 38 minutes. Roux won the first 2 points
of the tie-breaker, but Pozzi won the next 6.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, the tourney's No. 3 seed, put pressure on Ilie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to place some winners and make some
mistakes, so I was only watching for any problems,'' said Pioline.
``He tries to hit so hard and sometimes he overhits and there's
nothing you can do. He's hitting a winner or makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little off on my finishes,'' Ilie said. ``I played 75
percent and I needed to be at 100 percent to beat him. I was trying
to put shots away but I was a little bit off.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Pressure mounted on President Boris Yeltsin to cede
some of his powers or even step aside as Russia's political leaders
frantically negotiated over fundamental changes in the country's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Yeltsin's weakness, his political opponents pushed
for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of an uneven
transition to a democracy and market economy. They also proposed to
skirt the constitution by usurping some of the president's powers
and leaving him as a ceremonial head of the Government.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's future is so much in doubt here that rumors circulated
that he had signed an undated letter of resignation. While the
rumors were strongly denied by his spokesman, they seemed to
suggest a widening political vacuum in which an early resolution of
the crisis was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the country has been shaken by a deepening financial
crisis in which the value of the ruble seems to be evaporating by
the hour. For the second day in a row, Moscow's currency exchange
shut down 10 minutes after trading showed the value of the ruble
heading for another precipitous plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank of Russia, its reserves already severely
depleted, gave up trying to defend the currency and announced on
Thursday that the currency exchange will remain shut `'for some
time,'' meaning that it is virtually impossible to buy dollars
here.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he is ready to
take steps to bring the situation under control, although he did
not say what they will be.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters late on Thursday evening, he said, ``Now I
finally have a clear picture of the situation and can say it is
indeed difficult but absolutely manageable. A series of decisions
have been taken after consulting Russia's best brains. The main
goal is to stop the ruble's fall, not allow the economy to collapse
and reduce the losses of every Russian from this financial
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking crisis claimed its first victim on Thursday, with a
move by the Central Bank to nationalize the country's second
largest bank, SBS-Agro, which is deeply in debt. More banks
announced on Thursday that they will consolidate operations to
survive and seek common shelter from angry creditors and customers.
</P>
<P>
   With the value of the ruble now suspended, and few dollars
available trading at rates as high as 16 to the dollar _ almost
three times its 6.2 rate of two weeks ago _ Russia's financial
crisis has now seeped deep into the economy. There were scattered
reports on Thursday of panic buying of food stuffs, of stores
shutting down as they await new prices and of a spreading deadlock
on payments from banks to their clients, from employers to their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a hasty trip on Wednesday to Ukraine where he met
with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Chernomyrdin
resumed talks with the Communist opposition over their demands for
an reversal of Russia's economic policies. The parliament's
program, released on Thursday, calls for a return to increased
state control over the economy, including the nationalization of
strategic industries. The Communist Party, now Russia's largest
opposition party, is also expected to press for a number of jobs in
the Chernomyrdin cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But looming over the future of the new government is the
uncertain future of Yeltsin himself, the man who has dominated
Russia's shaky democracy since its birth seven years ago. His
recent absence from the political scene, after Sunday's abrupt
change in government, has again fueled rumors of his early
resignation and deteriorating health. Pressed by rumors circulating
here and abroad that Yeltsin is ready to resign, Kremlin spokesmen
on Thursday repeatedly stated that such reports were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   `'The president's resignation has been and is out of the
question,'' Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
on Thursday night, after CBS reported that Yeltsin had agreed to
resign once Chernomyrdin is confirmed as prime minister by the
parliament ``I would like the Russian public, the Russian and
foreign media, to calm down,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin _ who since a televised statement Monday has appeared
only once this week to meet the visiting Vietnamese president _ is
due to meet on Friday with President Pyotr Stoyanov of Bulgaria,
and next week with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move that spoke volumes about Yeltsin's diminished
authority, it was Yastrzhembsky who went to the parliament on
Thursday and spent three hours in conference with the chief of
Russia's Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov. The focus of their
discussions was a draft document which demands that the president
cede his considerable powers to appoint and fire governments and
sign economic decrees, and yield them to the parliament, or Duma,
now dominated by the Communist Party-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the document would commit the Duma to support
Chernomyrdin as prime minister, stop impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin, impose a moratorium on no confidence votes against
the government and pass a law on ``social guarantees'' for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The political document _ devised as an informal treaty between
the Kremlin, the Duma and the Russian government _ would circumvent
the Russian constitution, forcing Yeltsin to become little more
than a ceremonial head of state, with powers similar to Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a well-informed Russian journalist, Yastrzhembsky
told Zyuganov on Thursday that the president will refuse to sign
the document. Zyuganov, in turn, said that without the president's
signature, the parliament will not confirm Chernomyrdin as prime
minister at a session now scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments after the meeting, Yastrzhembsky said only
that the political document, and the separate draft program for a
radical change in the country's economic course, ``constitute a
basis for compromise.'' Zyuganov hinted that negotiations are not
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential camp is now aware of what is happening in the
country and now that they understand reality, consultations may
become more productive,'' he said, noting in other comments that
the president's future ``social welfare'' was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies, Yeltsin's resignation before his term expires in
2000 is `'definitely under discussion, but the issue is when, and
with what mechanism.'' Markov said Yeltsin's primary concern will
be a guarantee that he and his family will be immune from any
future prosecution, which could arise on a list of charges,
including treason, included in articles of impeachment now being
discussed in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   `'But,'' said Markov,''Boris Yeltsin can only resign if he sees
that Mr. Chernomyrdin controls the situation.'' Markov and other
political analysts say pressure on Yeltsin to resign is probably
coming from advisers who want to see Chernomyrdin _ whom Yeltsin
has already anointed as his successor _ run for president in early
elections, before he is too badly tarnished by the economic crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But other analysts cautioned that most resignation scenarios now
spinning wildly on Moscow's rumor mill lack any hard information
about Yeltsin's own intentions. `'We don't know what the president
thinks about it,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the
Politica Foundation. `'There is alot of talk about this
resignation, but no one is sure if he is well informed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Everything is up to Yeltsin,''said Pavel Voshchanov, a
journalist who was the Russian president's press spokesman during
the 1991 coup. `'The situation in the Kremlin is in complete
disarray, almost everyone has left him. He is in a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, who heads a party that has opposed Yeltsin's
policies but supports economic reform, said in a radio interview
that Yeltsin has to come forward with an explanation for his
decision to rename Chernomyrdin as prime minister, five months
after he fired him. `'If the Chernomyrdin appointment implies early
elections, let us hear this,'' said Yavlinsky in an Echo Moskvy
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that Chernomyrdin, faced with a fast
deteriorating economic situation, is ready to compromise with the
parliament, and its Communist-dominated majority, and even accept
its draft economic program. He is also expected to agree on naming
several Communists to his cabinet, although both sides may agree
that their ministerial portfolios should be limited to second-tier
positions, such as agriculture or culture.
</P>
<P>
   `'What Mr. Chernomyrdin needs most is early approval by the
Duma,'' said Nikonov, `'which is why he will sacrifice many things.
He also wants to spread responsibility as widely as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft document, now headed for discussion, would reverse a
seven-year- long economic reform program which has been based on
mass privatization and tight monetary policies. Instead, it calls
for increased government management of the economy, protection of
the banking system and support for Russian industry _ policies that
would necessarily require a mass infusion of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the program on Thursday, the parliament's deputy
speaker, Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's
party, Our Home is Russia, agreed that the program would require
money, ``but not a Niagra Falls of worthless rubles that will
inundate the economy and spur hyper-inflation.'' He described the
program as a compromise document, with proposals advanced by the
leftist opposition that is `'quite civilized and reasonable, not
extremist at all.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While global stock markets plunged, a major index of
commodity prices on everything from oil to cotton fell to its
lowest level in 21 years Thursday. And that may be more worrisome
for investors in the long run than Thursday's 4.2 percent decline
in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Each tick down in the price of oil, copper, cotton, and gold
puts more economic pressure on the nations that produce them. And
many of the major producers are emerging market countries
experiencing a financial crisis, like Russia, which is a major
exporter of oil and precious metals, or countries considered
vulnerable, like Mexico, also a major oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Already commodity prices have fallen 20 percent in the last year
and heightened the concerns about the developing world that began
with the Asian financial panic in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flu, it's catching; it's dominoes,'' said William
Byers, director of futures research at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. ``Not
only is the psychology spreading, but the economic weakness is
spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop came on the same day that markets around the world
tumbled as Russia's economic crisis deepened. Millions of
investors, seeking to flee the market turmoil, rushed to the
relative haven of United States Treasury securities, pushing
long-term yields to their lowest level in 30 or more years.
</P>
<P>
   For the American investor worried about the strength of the
economy, which by all current signs is still strong, and corporate
earnings, which have been weakening, so far the fall in commodity
prices and the drop in American interest rates has been good news.
</P>
<P>
   While tough on emerging market and other producer countries, the
lower prices have cut corporate costs here and spurred consumer
spending. And the damage that had been done to American commodity
producers has not had a major impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in interest rates has also been a positive for the
American economy, by bolstering housing and capital investment.
Thirty-year mortgage rates have now been less than 7 percent for
more than two months. Thursday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell to 5.34 percent the lowest for long-term yields in 30
years. The 10-year note yield, a benchmark for home mortgage rates,
fell 5.06 percent, its lowest since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   These forces have, so far, have more than offset the drag from
the Asian economic crisis, which has led to a sharp drop in demand
for American exports. And this is one reason the American economy
has slowed much less than many economists expected in the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   But with the global economic turmoil spreading from Asia to
Russia and now pressuring Latin America, it appears less likely,
some analysts said, that the positives of lower interest rates and
low commodity prices will be enough to offset the growing drag from
a global economic slowdown on American corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Already many economic forecasters who had bet on the offsetting
impact from lower commodity prices and lower interest rates have
been scaling back their economic forecasts for the second half of
the year. And a steep fall in American stocks, which would dampen
consumer spending, may force a further scaling back, which would
not be good for the outlook for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you correct the problems'' in Asia and Russia, said
Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, ``the
stimulus will be a minor offset.''
</P>
<P>
   The backwash from the Russian turmoil pushed the
Bridge-Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodities down 1.88
points, to 196.24, the lowest since December 1977, a year of sharp
declines in agricultural prices that lead to farmer protests.
</P>
<P>
   The impact from the commodity price decline has gone beyond
emerging market countries. In Canada, a major commodity producer
itself, the currency dropped to another record low, forcing the a
the Bank of Canada to raise its benchmark interest rate one
percentage point to 6 percent. The increase also helped send the
Toronto Stock Exchange index down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two forces have been pushing commodity prices lower and will
continue to do so, several analysts said Thursday. One is the
falling demand from Asia, which for example was a major consumer of
copper for new construction. The other is that countries in
trouble, like Russia, are expected to sell what they can to raise
money, adding to the supply in an already weak market.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch,
said that there had been big sales of platinum and paladium by
Russia in Japan and sales of gold and silver in Zurich and London.
The crisis, he said, ``inspires them to sell as much as possible.''
The government controls much of the countries precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   The selling by Russia was an odd twist. Gold had been thought of
for years as refuge in the time of political and economic crises,
and a few gold bugs still hold that belief. But Thursday the price
of gold plunged, dropping to a 19-year low on in the spot market in
London of $276.55 an ounce, down $5.70.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity selling is also coming from countries like Australia
who currency also fell to a record low Thursday. But because most
commodities are priced in dollars, the weaker Australian dollar
means gold and other commodity sellers can reap a nice profit when
the sales are translated back into the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   This all means that commodity prices _ and the pain that they
are bringing to already troubled economies _ still have a way to go
before they hit bottom. ``I don't think we are there yet,'' said
Berner of Mellon Bank.

CBS TO SPIN OFF BILLBOARD AND RADIO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to boost its sagging stock price, CBS
Corp. said Thursday that it planned to spin off up to 20 percent of
its radio and outdoor advertising businesses in an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS stock has fallen 25.8 percent from its 52-week high of
$36.625 on April 8 because of investor concern about the
profitability of the television network, which lost money last year
as its ratings continued to lag. By taking public a piece of the
lucrative radio and advertising operations and creating a separate
company for them, CBS President Mel Karmazin hopes to showcase the
corporation's far more profitable operations and remind investors
that those businesses are unrecognized in CBS' own stock price.
Karmazin owns 1.1 percent of CBS. In a day of dreadful news on Wall
Street, CBS stock jumped $2.0625, to close at $29.25.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to raise about $3 billion, the bulk of which
would be used to reduce its $5 billion in debt, and free it either
to buy back stock or make acquisitions. CBS Chairman Michael Jordan
told analysts the company wants to buy more television stations.
But that is a problem because the company's 14 television stations
already reach 32 percent of U.S. television households, close to
the federal limit of 35 percent. Although the three broadcast
networks have lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to get
that ceiling raised to 50 percent, experts say a change is
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Stations owned by networks generate operating profit margins
anywhere from 35 percent to 55 percent, while today the networks
themselves would be happy with margins of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel repeated rumors that he is unhappy with the
network business and would like to sell it, Karmazin emphatically
told analysts that he had no plans for a sale, adding that people
who believe CBS will sell the network should sell the stock, said
one person who attended the conference. Karmazin called the network
his ``favorite'' business.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have expressed skepticism about a sale of the
network, in part because they say it is unlikely that CBS could
find a buyer now at a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But turning the network around could prove difficult. The major
networks' overall audience share continues to decline. Desperate to
break through the growing clutter of rival cable services, each
network has paid heavily for the costly rights to highly visible
sports events.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS network showed a loss last year and is expected to do so
again this year, in part because of a failure to attract the
younger prime-time audience that commands higher advertising
dollars. Still, Karmazin promised analysts that next year, the
first year of the network's National Football League contract _
with fees that start at about $300 million and escalate _ would be
profitable at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin said the company anticipates $180 million in 1999 cost
savings generated by layoffs and programing changes. The layoffs,
which the company said would cut costs by as much as $40 million,
would take place across the board at the corporate level and at the
network, including news, sports and programing, though the radio
and advertising division would be unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has roughly 13,000 employees, about 5,000 of whom work at
the network, including 1,400 people in the news division. Though
the company did not quantify the breadth of layoffs at the news
division, another person close to CBS foresaw a reduction of about
100 people. CBS plans to take a $50 million restructuring charge in
the third quarter to account for severance payments related to the
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to slash programing costs by $80 million
to $95 million. ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Cybill,'' ``Step by Step'' and
``Family Matters'' all face ratings declines and are being taken
off the air. Those series, each of which costs CBS $1.8 million an
episode, are being replaced by seven new programs, including ``King
of Queens'' and ``Maggie Winters,'' each of which costs roughly
$600,000 an episode. CBS will have an ownership interest in six of
the new series, so the company will retain roughly half of any
syndication revenues. However, if the new shows fail, the company
faces additional costs in finding replacements.
</P>
<P>
   In putting a value on the new radio company, Karmazin told
analysts that in 1999 the radio group was expected to generate
roughly $1 billion in cash flow, or earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. Other companies with radio
and outdoor advertising, like Clear Channel Communications, are
trading at 20 to 23 times cash flow. Using that figure, the new
company, which would own 155 radio stations and the outdoor
advertising business and would operate under the name Infinity
Broadcasting, would be worth $20 billion to $23 billion, analysts
said. It would carry roughly $750 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering, which is expected to be completed
in November, is unlikely to stop rumors of a sale or merger.
Jessica Reif Cohen, who follows the media for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
has said that even if CBS is not sold, it might do some kind of
joint venture with Time Warner Inc. to merge the two companies'
news operations. Time Warner owns the Cable News Network. And the
two companies could cross promote the CBS Network and the Time
Warner's WB Network.

CLINTON SEEKS TO SHIFT FOCUS TO POLICY ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Warmed by the embrace of fellow Democrats,
President Clinton tried Thursday to turn the nation's focus back to
policy issues and away from the sex scandal that has imperiled his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton interrupted his Martha's Vineyard vacation for a
20-minute flight to this working-class, heavily Democratic city
where he attempted to reclaim those issues that he had hoped would
define his two terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McGovern, the congressman who invited Clinton to
Worcester, set the tone for the enthusiastic support dished out to
the president, from the crowds that lined the streets to the
hundreds jammed into a concern hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a city of fair-weather friends. A friend of
Worcester is a friend for life and you, Mr. President, through your
policies, have been a true friend of Worcester,'' McGovern told
Clinton as the audience erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   But outside Mechanics Hall, an ornate pre-Civil War structure, a
small crowd chanted, ``Resign, resign'' as the president arrived.
Handmade signs with similar messages were held by bystanders along
the motorcade route. A large banner reading ``Liar!'' also was
paraded around the street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been secluded with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and daughter Chelsea on the island off the Massachusetts coast
since admitting an affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky and
conceding he lied to his family and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people of Massachusetts strongly support the
president's initiatives on health care for children, education
reform, a cleaner environment,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
a survivor of several personal scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of issues that are of concern to the
people of Massachusetts and I think across the country. I think
people want to get on, want to move on,'' Kennedy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, at least temporarily, is banking on just that
as advisers debate whether the president should again address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national address Aug. 17 was long on defiance and
short on contrition, and it renewed anxiety among Democrats in an
election year. The speech, in which the president criticized
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, was roundly panned on Capitol
Hill and calls have increased for Clinton to broach the subject
again.
</P>
<P>
   But he avoided any talk of scandal Thursday, instead speaking of
the issues facing Congress when it returns from its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to relax. We must become more rigorous. And
we must ... use the newfound confidence of America to think more
boldly, not less boldly, for our children's future,'' Clinton told
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited Social Security reform, education, health
care, the environment and campaign finance reform as issues facing
the nation. ``And these things are important,'' Clinton said. ``So
I say to you, the energy that brought you here today, the concern
you have for these issues, you need to bring it back to every
single major challenge this country faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the president made the trip here to announce the
release of an early warning guide for teachers and principals to
identify problem students before they turn violent and to announce
the release of $30 million to states to provide college
scholarships to aspiring police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But, unofficially, the White House also was gauging the level of
public support for the president and seeking a friendly venue for
his first venture before an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach turned a little last week when I watched,'' said
Laura Erickson, 24, a teacher of juvenile delinquent girls, who
attended Thursday's event. ``I feel better. I'm interested in what
he has to say today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Murgo, 72, a retired tollbooth attendant and audience
member, said, ``It's nobody's business. Let him get on with his
work.''
</P>
<P>
   In an adjacent hall where a larger crowd had watched the
president's remarks, supporters shouted at reporters: ``Good
riddance to you, press.'' The White House strategically turned up
the volume of swing music, drowning out reporters' questions to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a sign of Democratic skittishness, Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., turned aside questions about whether he supported Clinton.
Kerry instead noted he had been on vacation and wanted to talk
about issues.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 schoolchildren, several carrying ``welcome'' signs,
greeted the president as his small jet landed at Worcester Regional
Airport. Reporters who normally travel aboard Air Force One with
the president were banished to a second plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should have lied to us like he did,
especially on national television,'' said Dan Lodi, 17, a senior at
South High Community School. But the teen-ager added, ``We've all
done some things we're not proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not the only member of the administration making a
public appearance Thursday while under a cloud of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, at town meeting on school violence in
San Francisco, made his first public statement about a new Justice
Department inquiry into whether an independent prosecutor should be
appointed to look into fund-raising phone calls he made from his
government office for the 1996 Democratic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to fully cooperate with the Justice Department
during their preliminary inquiry,'' Gore said, ``and I remain
confident that they will conclude that, as I know, everything that
I did was legal and proper. He refused to answer reporters'
question on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day investigation was set in motion Wednesday by Attorney
General Janet Reno. Last year, Reno had refused to request an
outside prosecutor, but she reopened the question after the recent
discovery of a memo which suggested Gore may have known he was
soliciting ``hard money'' contributions that would go directly into
candidate campaigns rather than only party-building ``soft money''
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff has said the vice president was questioned by
Justice Department on the memo before he left on a two-week
vacation in Hawaii, which concluded Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock market investors around the world rushed the
exits Thursday. Too many troubling economic questions and not
enough calming answers spurred selling from the time Wall Street
opened.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 4.19 percent, or 357 points, to close at 8165.99. The
Nasdaq composite fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow average now 12.5 percent below its July 17 high of
9337.97, investors are well into what Wall Street calls a
correction. Bear market territory _ defined as a stock price
decline of 15 percent to 20 percent _ is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   World markets fell in unison, with the exception of Hong Kong,
which was up slightly. In Europe, key indexes fell 3 percent to 6
percent, with the Dax index in Germany dropping 4.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, disappointed in Japan's inability to repair its
broken-down economy, drove the Nikkei 225 index down 3.04 percent
long before trading began in the United States. Policy paralysis
seems to have overtaken Japanese politicians, who appear unwilling
to take steps to solve their well-documented problems. The Nikkei
has fallen 16.5 percent this year from its March high.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in U.S. stocks was heavy Thursday: 940 million shares
exchanged hands on the New York Stock Exchange, close to the record
1.1 billion shares that traded last October when the market
declined 554 points. Margin calls were a major factor in the
carnage Thursday, as brokerage firms asked investors who had
borrowed to buy stocks to prop up their depleted portfolios with
more cash. During the morning, when an investor telephoned the
mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price to move some funds, a recorded
message announced that there would be a two-minute wait before a
representative picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and money managers reported a flood of early selling
that continued in waves all day. Even though stocks tried to rally
several times during the day, few, if any, buyers were willing to
pick through the rubble for bargains. The market closed at its low
for the day, a sign of overwhelming market weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit Thursday in U.S. markets were shares of big
international banks, down an average 6.6 percent on fears of
exposure to Russia-related lending losses. But rampant selling
ravaged even the most favored stocks, such as Coca Cola, General
Electric, Microsoft as well as internet darlings Excite Inc. and
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   That even the healthiest companies' shares got punished was
attributable to investors forced to meet margin calls on their
emerging market investments. American investors are learning the
hard way, that when an investor has to cough up cash because his
foreign investments are cratering, he sells whatever he can. Often
that means selling the biggest, most liquid investment he has. Or
the investment he still has a profit in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vicious circle, said William Dudley, economist at
Goldman, Sachs in New York. ``People are becoming increasingly
risk-averse, leading to lower equity prices, increasing pressure on
emerging market economies. Absent right now is any mechanism to
break that dynamic up.'' As a result, Dudley believes investors
should brace themselves for more downside moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news started early Thursday. At 9:46 a.m., shares in
Republic New York Corp, the parent of Republic Bank, halted trading
in anticipation of a news report. Minutes later, the bank announced
it would take a $110 million charge in the third quarter for losses
in Russian government bonds. The loss would virtually eliminate
earnings for the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it became clear that the ultimate impact of the
Russian disaster was still unknown. If Republic Bank, known for its
strong balance sheet and conservative lending practices, was hurt
by Russia, what would happen to more aggressive lenders?
</P>
<P>
   With its announcement, Republic Bank became the first domestic
bank to shed light on its Russian losses. Market historians noted
that Republic was also the first domestic bank, back in the
mid-1980s, to reveal the extent of its exposure to lesser-developed
country debt that later hammered Citicorp and other American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in financial stocks Thursday found themselves in a
nightmarish version of the child's game of hot potato. Exposure to
Russia's ruble devaluation and effective default on its debt is
only starting to be defined. And since many of the losses will be
taken by investors who bought or sold derivative securities, where
the folks who took the other side of a given trade, called
counterparties, are not immediately identifiable, it could be weeks
before the true effects of what may be $100 billion in losses are
known. Some investors wondered why a country as economically
inconsequential as Russia should play such a dramatic role in world
market turmoil. Yes, Russian wields nuclear firepower, but it
accounts for just 1 percent of the world's trade, roughly
equivalent to that of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts explained Russia's role in Thursday's world market woes
this way: what happened there could very well replay in the
emerging markets of Latin America. When investors see their
portfolios lose 80 percent of their value, as those holding Russian
debt have, two things happen. Assets in other emerging markets need
to be repriced lower to reflect this new economic reality. And, as
those assets are repriced, investors and lenders withdraw from the
markets, cutting off companies' access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's default also made it painfully obvious that the
International Monetary Fund is no longer ready or able to bail out
countries in economic despair. Bailouts in Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand had lulled investors into believing that the IMF was
effectively a guarantor of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital is contracting rapidly from every place that has to
pay a premium to get money,'' said Martin Armstrong, chairman of
Princeton Economic Institute in Princeton, N.J. ``The Russia impact
is having serious significance in the sense that banks that have
taken hits there go down the entire emerging market group and
withdraw their credit lines.''
</P>
<P>
   So what investors are facing now is the very thing Wall Street
fears the most: the unknown. The devil we know, an imploding Russia
in this case, is bad enough. The devil we don't know, what other
economic disasters lie ahead, most particularly in Latin America,
is considerably worse.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on Latin America. That's because a crisis in these
nations would strike a severe blow to both American investors and
corporations. Some 25 percent of Brazil's $300 billion in domestic
debt, for example, is held by foreign investors. More important,
around 20 percent of U.S. exports go to Latin America.

</P>
<P>
   Some investors marveled at the selling that has taken some
stocks down 75 percent from their highs. One money manager said
that this is what happens when investors buy stocks only because
they are going up. ``People have been investing by the direction of
earnings and not looking at value,'' said David Eidelman, at
Eidelman, Finger, Harris &AMP; Co. in St. Louis. ``If earnings are
going higher, they buy. But when they start to see earnings come
down, they look at the direction not the value.'' As a result,
stocks get bid down too low. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, these
investors, so-called momentum players, know the price of everything
and the value of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   More than one professional trader said that Thursday's action in
U.S. stocks was reminiscent of the beginning of the end of the
great bull market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. These traders
recalled that the 1973 bear market, which removed 45 percent from
the Dow Jones industrial average, didn't begin in earnest until the
Nifty Fifty stocks _ names like Polaroid _ crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, approximately 15 stocks _ including Dell
Computer, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems _ have held up
while the rest of the U.S. market have fallen. Thursday, even these
shares fell hard.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rather than give Russia a quick infusion of money
in an emergency attempt to ease its economic crisis, the
International Monetary Fund has apparently decided to take up to a
month to consider whether to lend Russia more money.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the IMF loaned Russia $4.8 billion and agreed
consider an additional payout of $4.3 billion in late September.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his prime
minister and named Viktor Chernomyrdin to replace him. As
Chernomyrdin tries to put the economy back together, he faces
demands from the Communist Party, the largest opposition group, for
increased state control of the market and less emphasis on
balancing the budget _ an approach unlikely to please the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus flew to Washington on
Thursday from his meeting with Chernomyrdin and is to report to the
IMF's board Friday. ``We need to see what the facts are and what
the Russian authorities will do, and then get the IMF assistance
program back on track,'' said IMF spokesman Shail Anjaria.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians gave events a different slant Thursday. Acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was quoted by the Russian news
agency Interfax on Thursday as having said that he had Camdessus'
backing in his so far unsuccessful efforts to stop the ruble's
slide and stave off an economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men, at a hastily arranged meeting in the Ukraine on
Wednesday, apparently only reviewed their positions, officials
close to the IMF negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   What the IMF appears to be trying above all to resurrect, even
as the ruble slides precipitously, are two priority clauses in
Russia's current agreement, which was negotiated in early summer
with then-Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko but never approved by
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF continues to insist that the Russian government achieve
a balanced budget in two or three years, improving tax collections
to achieve this goal. The deficit now is an alarming 5 percent of
the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   The other clause specifies a reliable system for converting
rubles into dollars and other hard currencies in an unrestricted or
nearly unrestricted foreign exchange market. Conversion of rubles
to dollars was suspended Thursday for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, in return, would agree to let Russia repay foreign
lenders less than 100 cents on the dollar _ a concession the IMF
has already allowed in some Asian countries in recent months. A
year ago, before the Asian crisis began to spread economic
stagnation and market panic across much of the globe, such
concessions in debt repayment were not on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lenders, including several U.S. banks, hold more than
$10 billion in short-term Russian treasury securities denominated
in rubles. Acting unilaterally, the Russians on Tuesday stretched
out payment of these securities for three years or more, in effect
assuring that their dollar value will be eroded by devaluations of
the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials have not publicly attacked the move. And some
lenders in the private sector seem ready to go along with moderate
debt write-downs, as long as future payment of the lesser amount is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to prevent the Russian trouble from spilling
over to other countries, then we must strongly encourage the
Russians to meet their repayment obligations once there is some
write-down,'' said Charles Dallara, an economist at the Institute
for International Finance, whose clients include some of Russia's
big foreign lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the crisis might spread to Latin America, the IMF
has invited top Latin policy makers to Washington for discussions
next week, Dow Jones News Service reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The next IMF loan to Russia, for $4.3 billion, is scheduled for
disbursement in late September. That gives the Russians time to
``get their economy back on track,'' as some officials put it,
without halting the flow of IMF money. Since the Soviet Union
dissolved in late 1991, Russia has received more than $21 billion
in loans from the IMF, mostly to support the ruble, and the
Russians have repaid these loans on schedule, sending more than $5
billion back to the IMF through June.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the $21 billion already lent to the Russians, the IMF
has authorized an additional $10 billion to Russia, including the
$4.3 billion scheduled for late September, if Chernomyrdin and the
IMF can reach agreement.

FATAL PLANE CRASH COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED, OFFICIALS SAY

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deadly commuter plane crash near Detroit last
year probably could have been prevented if the Federal Aviation
Administration had adequate procedures for certifying turboprop
planes and had put into effect the lessons learned from a similar
crash, federal safety officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New procedures developed in response to a crash in 1994 of a
turboprop in Roselawn, Ind., that killed 68 people, probably would
have prevented the accident in Detroit, but their implementation
was lost in a bureaucratic tangle in the FAA, the National
Transportation Safety Board said at a meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both planes had been certified by the FAA as safe for flying
into ice, but the aviation agency still does not know everything it
needs to make that determination, the board said, and it called for
new testing on all turboprop models in service in this country.
There are 1,500 such planes in passenger service, carrying about 54
million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the safety board called for an immediate campaign to educate
pilots on new strategies for flying through icing conditions. Many
new strategies were developed after the 1995 crash of an ATR-72
owned by an American Airlines affiliate, American Eagle. Those
lessons were not incorporated by most other airlines, including
Comair, which flies as the Delta Connection, the board said. The
plane that crashed on approach to Detroit was an EMB-120, en route
from Comair's hub in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we see an accident like this repeating itself, on
information we should have already learned, its an indictment of
the whole system,'' said James Hall, chairman of the Safety Board.
``Icing needs to be aggressively approached, as windshear was in
the '80s, so hopefully we can eliminate it as a factor in future
accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how well the FAA regulates aviation safety, Hall
said, ``we aren't getting what we're paying for.''
</P>
<P>
   Turboprops are not as safe as jets, primarily because of
susceptibility to ice, top officials of the Safety Board said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, apparently resigned to taking one of the most severe
public beatings of the last few years, was terse in response. Eliot
Brenner, the assistant administrator for public affairs, said, ``we
got the recommendations, and we're looking at the process issues
raised by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to look at anything that can make that system
operate better,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also distributed a chronology of actions it has taken
since the second crash.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem identified by the Safety Board Thursday was that
Embraer, which builds the EMB-120, had written a new procedure that
probably would have prevented the accident, but the information got
lost between two branches of the FAA and no one instructed the
pilots. The new procedure, to regularly inflate a hard-rubber
baloonlike boot on the wing whenever the plane is in icing
conditions, was developed as a result of the Roselawn crash. Before
that crash, rules required pilots to inflate the deicing boot only
after ice formed.
</P>
<P>
   Procedures developed by manufacturers only go to pilots as
requirements if the FAA wants them to. That did not happen with
regard to icing procedures. ``After all of the investment, after
all of the tragedy of Roselawn, to have information that was
generated not make it into the cockpit is something we never want
to see happen again,'' said Hall. The Safety Board is an
independent, advisory agency; the FAA regulates pilots, airlines
and aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Detroit crash the FAA had been studying six previous
loss-of-control incidents in EMB-120s; there has been at least once
since then. The board said Thursday that ``despite the accumulated
lessons of several major accidents,'' the FAA's posture on the
risks posed by ice had remained ``incremental and reactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comair plane accumulated ``sandpaper ice'' on its wings,
rough enough to disrupt the airflow and cut lift very sharply. An
ice-free wing on a turboprop that can fly at an inclination to the
wind of up to 18 degrees, but with ice it may lose lift and cause a
crash at only five or six degrees, investigators said. But the
sandpaper ice may be so thin that it is difficult to see from the
cockpit, they said. The phenomenon of rough ice has been known
since the 1930s, and Safety Board investigators found in the FAA's
files a draft memo, dated one year before the crash, noting that
EMB-120s in airline use tended to develop control problems from
coats of ice so thin that their crews did not perceive a risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the tests used to approve the design of the plane are for
thick ice accumulation, not sandpaper ice, on the theory that if
planes can handle thick ice they can handle anything smaller. This
may be wrong, Safety Board engineers said. And by writing standards
that do not include testing for sandpaper ice, ``It does not cover
something that you may encounter in normal flight,'' said Bernard
Loeb, director of the office of aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all turboprops have a ``pneumatic boot'' system to
counter ice build-up, but at the time of the crash, pilots at five
of the seven airlines flying them were trained NOT to use it until
thick ice was visible, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are on the forward edges of the wings, thick rubber
balloons that alternately inflate and deflate to break off
accumulated ice. Common wisdom among airlines and FAA regulators is
that pilots should not turn the system on until visible ice has
developed, for fear of letting ice build up in a bulge shape on top
of the inflated boots, in which case the boots would inflate and
deflate within little ice pockets, without breaking the ice, a
purported phenomenon called ``ice bridging.''
</P>
<P>
   But the safety board said that this belief was obsolete, because
such bridging is not possible on modern aircraft. After Roselawn,
Embraer amended the aircraft manual to call for turning the system
on whenever ice was suspected. In the plane that crashed, the
pilots had already turned on a system to heat the propellers and
the windshield, as called for in company procedures, in
anticipation of ice.
</P>
<P>
   The change ws approved by the FAA's office of aircraft
certification. But the certification office never told the office
that regulates airplane operations. Loeb said that the FAA had told
Board investigators that there was no requirement for information
to be passed between the two branches.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer told Comair, too, and Comair sent a memo to pilots about
a month before the accident mentioning the advice. But the airline
did not make it a rule for pilots. A spokeswoman for the airline,
Meghan Glynn said Thursday that the airline would have no comment
until it had a chance to read the board's report.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said that under the system now in use, airlines have the
final say on such advice. ``The operator can choose to do what we
wants to with it,'' he said, ``the idea being, you build them, we
fly them, and we know how to fly them better than you because we do
it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Goglia, a member of the safety board, complained, ``not to
pass that kind of information on to people, who are operating these
airplanes in these conditions on almost a daily basis, is
unconscionable.'' The Board wants the airlines to either adopt the
manufacturers' procedures or demonstrate why they should not.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said that Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, was
``tied up on other issues'' and was not available to answer
questions about the Safety Board's criticisms. But, he said, ``she
has been very closely following this.''

   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Two years ago, residents of this
surfside resort just east of Wilmington returned to their island
after the passing of Hurricane Fran and found utter devastation.
Sand dunes were flattened. Beachfront houses were swamped. Boats
were tossed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   They found none of that Thursday as they streamed back to survey
the damage from Hurricane Bonnie, which blew through this area on
Wednesday afternoon. A few shingles were missing, a few dwellings
and businesses had water damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dunes, artificially replenished earlier this year, had lost
a bit of sand. A single small boat, the Bahama Gem, had been lifted
out of the marsh and deposited on a muddy bank. Even the Shell
Island Resort, a beachfront condominium that is close to falling
into the sea, suffered little noticeable damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate,'' said Ed Taylor, an assistant to the
town manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, just south of Wilmington, officials
expressed amazement at the dearth of significant destruction.
``It's totally unreal, especially as big as this hurricane was and
as long as it hung around,'' said Cecil Logan, a spokesman for the
county's disaster services. That was the sentiment up and down the
North Carolina coast Thursday as coastal residents, waterlogged but
relieved, awoke to the realization that Hurricane Bonnie had not
lived up to her advance notices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Hurricane Center reported that the
category 3 storm carried maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, there
were few physical signs that its power had been that intense. Some
longtime residents said they had developed an ear for hurricanes,
and could tell from the sound of the hurricane that it would not be
as destructive as Fran, which caused nearly $6 billion in property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said it was too early to make a dollar
assessment of the damage from the latest hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Gore, a 66-year-old lawyer who has lived for 33 years on
the Cape Fear River in Southport, said that really bad storms would
progress from whistling to howling to roaring to screeching to
screaming. ``We had screeching but we didn't have as much of it as
with Fran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday,
with winds of 70 mph slowly churning northward through eastern
North Carolina, there were still no reports of deaths or serious
injuries from it. Many of the injuries that were reported by area
hospitals, including electric shocks and carbon monoxide poisoning,
resulted from the improper use of generators.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, plenty of ecological consequences,
particularly for sand dunes and rain-sodden rivers. The Pamlico
River washed over its banks in places near Washington, N.C., as did
the Neuse River in New Bern, where major highways were closed. Many
cities in the region received between nine and 11 inches of
rainfall in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Carolina Beach, just south of here, close to where
the eye of the storm made landfall, reported that several feet of
sand had washed ashore on the north end of their island.
</P>
<P>
   At North Topsail Beach, early assessments indicated that 60
percent of the dunes had washed away, some in half-mile long
chunks. On one end of the island, a truck was buried in sand to the
tops of its tires. Boardwalks were twisted and torn away and some
houses were perched precariously near the edge of the water,
because of beach and dune erosion.
</P>
<P>
   North Topsail Beach, with the help of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, had spent $2 million replenishing the dunes
blown away by Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to start over again,'' said Tony
Hammond, the town manager. ``The ones that had the vegetation
seemed to have held up better. The ones with limited vegetation
didn't do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton declared North Carolina a
disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance like loans
to farmers and emergency assistance for food and clothing. The aid
was announced in a telephone call between Gov. James Hunt Jr. and
White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who has said he is
considering a campaign for governor of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Aguirre, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said that the center of storm was near Elizabeth
City early this evening and was expected to move to the Northeast
and eventually into the Atlantic at about 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He said another hurricane, Danielle, was ``following behind on
the heels of Bonnie'' in the Atlantic with winds approaching 90
mph. He said it was too soon to predict the storm's path as it
nears the United States. Almost everyone here suffered some
inconvenience from the hurricane, but little more. As of 4 p.m.
Thursday, some 248,000 households and businesses remained without
electricity in eastern North Carolina, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on many barrier islands kept bridges closed,
preventing evacuated residents from returning to their homes,
because they were still checking for downed power lines and for
damage to water and sewage systems. As they waited for hours at a
checkpoint at the foot of the bridge to Carolina Beach, many
residents could not hide their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave again,'' said J. Nicole Haywood. ``I may die in
the next one, but I won't leave. This just irks me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a day without power, many residents were
desperate for hot showers and hot meals. At Johnny's Deli and New
York Style Pizzeria, one of the first restaurants in Wilmington to
open Thursday morning, a line of eager customers stretched out the
door at 11 a.m. Pizza for brunch? Why not, said Wendy R. Kulp, a
22-year-old Wilmington woman who survived the hurricane on a diet
of potato chips and apples. ``I heard on the radio that it was
open,'' she said. ``We looked it up in the yellow pages and rushed
over here as fast as we could. The thought of hot food and cooked
cheese sounds really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Others waiting for pizza said they were happy to get outside
after spending Wednesday trapped indoors. ``I'm really sick of
talking to them,'' said Tracey Hopkins, gesturing toward her two
roommates. ``And we've done all the crossword puzzles in People
magazine for the last three months.''

RUSSIA'S LARGEST BANKS STRUGGLE TO STAVE OFF DEATH THROWS

practices exacerbated recent financial crisis; details and
polishing throughout.)  (See also: RUSSIA-RDP, RUSSIA-COALITION, RUSSIA-EUROPE,

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a brief but wild ride for Russia's cowboy
banking empires, and, like the economy on which they were saddled,
they appear headed for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' importance lies less in their size or conventional
banking duties but in their roles as lenders to the government and
as currency speculators. They gave the government easy credit and
got hooked on the returns, and when things started going really
sour two weeks ago, their flight to the dollar made the situation
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russian banking system is insolvent, the victim of bad
management, very bad bets on the stability of the ruble and
execrable investments in near-worthless government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Their behavior has left their best client _ the government, now
led by Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin _ with the
unenviable choice between pleasing the entrepreneurs behind many
banks and keeping the banks afloat, or shutting them down and
risking social unrest with unknown consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Capping two weeks of increasingly alarmist rumors, the Russian
government said Thursday night that it intends to nationalize
SBS-Agro Bank, by most measures the country's third-largest. Within
minutes, five more major banks announced plans to merge.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, 10 of the country's 15 biggest banks have either
combined, folded or been earmarked for government takeover. They
will not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, the combined balance sheets of the 15 biggest
banks are at least $4 billion in the hole, a figure that leaps
every day the Russian ruble continues to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 1,300 or so banks, mostly so small as to be
insignificant, are being dragged along in the fiscal undertow. Many
will not be missed, for Russian banks are not banks as westerners
know them, and most Russians keep their savings either at home or
in the giant, government-owned Sberbank, which almost certainly
will not be allowed to go under. Of the smaller houses, some are
money-launderers; some currency speculators; some investment houses
or pension funds or insurance companies or conduits to offshore
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest are cash drawers for vast conglomerates, moving
money among their component companies.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question is what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   On a purely rubles-and-kopecks basis, the solution is pretty
clear: ``Under normal market conditions, banks would fail,'' said
Alex Kotcherguine, the bank credit specialist for Russia and
Eastern Europe for Paribas European Investment in London. ``But
there are no normal market conditions in Russia, as we have all
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is already an open struggle over whether to let
the banks die or use the country's dwindling resources to keep them
on life support.
</P>
<P>
   Neither alternative is pleasant: one wipes out up to 80 percent
of all banks, with unknown effects on their creditors and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The other would require printing more money to shore up sickly
banks and their wealthy owners _ and that would threaten to
re-ignite inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ousted economic reformers, along with the western
investors who stand to lose billions from a total collapse of the
system, want the government to shut down the sickest banks and
focus its rescue on the few worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   So, it is said, do some banks controlled by industrial behemoths
_ so-called oligarchs _ whose businesses benefit from foreign trade
and western credit, such as oil exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the sickest banks, controlled by other oligarchs,
are dead set against that. The board of SBS-Agro said Thursday
night that it had been blindsided by the government's takeover plan
and demanded that the Kremlin pay ``hundreds of millions of
dollars'' in obligations, presumably in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin may be somewhere in the middle. A draft economic
program approved by his supporters in the Russian Duma Thursday
called for increased protection of banks and depositors, but
offered no specifics beyond a denial that the proposals were
radical.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has shut only one of the top 15 banks,
Imperial Bank, which had defaulted earlier on a $50 million foreign
loan and was closed Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
   In terms of global finance, this battle seems at first to be
almost insignificant. The combined assets of all Russian banks as
figured by the Central Bank last January totalled a mere $100
billion _ less than the ninth-largest bank in America, First
Chicago NBD Corp. Russia's largest bank, state-controlled Sberbank,
is only about as big as Summit Bancorp, the 28th-largest U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the banks have deep roots in the economy. Few Russians
trust much of their money to them _ proportionately, household
deposits are 6 to 10 times smaller than in many western countries.
</P>
<P>
   One motive behind the string of mergers, some analysts say, is
for weak banks to ally themselves with the few banks that serve
households and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is that the government will nurse those banks
first and terminate others _ such as Imperial _ whose failures will
not drain the wallets of ordinary workers.
</P>
<P>
   But assets and deposits are not what count most in the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The banks matter in part because they fed the government's
appetite for easy credit over the last five years, when deficits
were mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's biggest banks established industrial empires _
and close ties to politicians _ by lending the government money,
then accepting shares of state-owned companies in lieu of payment
on the loans.
</P>
<P>
   The business of financing government activities at ever-growing
interest rates became a staple of bank business and provided
capital for other, riskier ventures such as currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Between the beginning of 1995 and the middle of 1996, the volume
of short-term government debt ballooned from 1.5 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product to close to 8 percent. And of that
8 percent, as much as five percent was interest payments to
bondholders _ primarily banks.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia declared a temporary halt to paying off its bond
debt on August 17, Russian banks held 105 billion rubles in
short-term bonds _ then about $17 billion _ at interest rates as
high as 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the big state- and city-owned banks, many large
Russian banks are the financial string that ties together the
business conglomerates of the oligarchs and other financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the banks manage their finances and supply them with
loans _ often at sweetheart rates _ but it is commonly believed
that they move money in and out of Russia for tax and investment
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A huge amount of money has fled Russia _ according to Credit
Suisse-First Boston, at least $66 billion from 1994 to 1997 alone.
Cyprus, the best-known offshore tax haven, is home to at least
2,000 subsidiaries of Russian companies, according to Steven
Shevoley, a Thomson Bankwatch vice president who watches Russian
banks from the island.
</P>
<P>
   Had that money remained in the country, it would have spurred
domestic investment and reduced the government's need for deficit
spending, one root of its current woes.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' role as private kitties for industry, combined with
lax supervision from political appointees in the Russian
government, abetted another problem: poor management. No one knows
how much money Russian banks lost through insider deals, fraud and
outright stupidity, but the sum surely is huge, analysts say.
Through poor investments, wrongheaded speculation and shoddy
lending, Russian banks already have lost at least 190 billion
rubles this year alone, according to the investment firm Brunswick
Warburg. That is roughly $22.5 billion at this week's rate of 8.5
rubles per dollar, and far more at the rate that prevailed earlier
this year of about 6 rubles per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The banks have inadvertently worsened the government's problems
since the full-blown fiscal crisis emerged this month by rushing to
convert their own ruble holdings into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   When the government tried to free up cash for strapped banks
late last week by reducing the amount of capital they are required
to keep on hand, virtually all the freed money was immediately
converted into dollars _ and the ruble dropped another 10 percent
in a single day. In the last 10 days alone, the government has
spent more than $2 billion of its hard-currency reserves defending
the ruble, in part from its own banks.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of that effort became apparent this week, when the
Central Bank finally announced that it would stop defending the
ruble and shut down the currency exchange.

 &HT;    Hurricane Danielle remains quiet
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Forecasters won't know until Saturday
morning, but Hurricane Danielle appears to be destined for an
uneventful death at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The small, speeding storm is not expected to threaten Florida
and likely will turn north by the weekend and miss the U.S.
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The models are indicating it will continue on a northwest
track and then turn,'' said Bob Ebaugh of the National Hurricane
Center in Miami. ``The conditions are looking favorable for us
right now. We'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic season, was
expected strengthen from Thursday's 90 mph winds as it travels at
about 18 to 20 mph through today. Forecasters believe it has not
been influenced by Hurricane Bonnie, the storm that moved on a
similar path and then pounded the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is enough separation between the storms that
Bonnie has not affected Danielle,'' Ebaugh said. ``It's just the
way the conditions are set up right now that has made them go on
roughly the same course.''
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean islands were spared Thursday as Danielle stayed well
to the north, and high-level winds sheered the top of Danielle's
storm clouds and cut its speed. Unlike the 400-mile-wide Bonnie,
Danielle's hurricane-force winds extended only about 45 miles from
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody just keep an eye on it without anxiety,'' said Brian
Jarvinen, a forecaster at the hurricane center. ``On Saturday,
we'll know for sure what's going to happen here. It'll still be far
enough away from anybody that it shouldn't cause a lot of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a tropical wave moved Thursday night through the
Florida Straits and into South Florida and is expected to bring
showers and thunderstorms here today and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At noon today, with tours and refreshments, Palm Beach County
will formally open its new Emergency Operations Center at the
corner of Military Trail and Belvedere Road in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.5 million building with state-of-the-art electronic
monitoring and communication equipment has concrete walls that can
withstand 200 mph storm winds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it appears Danielle won't be around to mark the
festivities or test the structural engineering.

 &HT;    Floods soak Carolina coast
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, N.C. -- Parking lots turned into swimming holes.
City streets became canals for canoes. Refrigerators floated like
buoys.
</P>
<P>
   As Tropical Storm Bonnie lazily exited North Carolina late
Thursday night, nearly 20 inches of rain fell in eastern parts of
the Tarheel State and contributed to extensive flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding is going to be greater than we thought,'' Gov.
Jim Hunt said. ``The tides came up and our rivers couldn't get
out.'' That meant they overflowed into houses, streets and
businesses. Hunt said he would maintain a state of emergency ``for
several days.''
</P>
<P>
   On the waterfront of Washington's business district, the Pamlico
River spilled over a bulkhead and flowed 200 yards across a parkway
and through the backdoor of Pamlico Provisions, a general store
that sells kayaks and dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jimbo McKeon boarded and caulked the doors facing the
river but couldn't stop six inches of water from flooding his store
Thursday. The water wedged strings of green seaweed under McKeon's
plywood barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to live on the river, you've got to expect
there's going to be a possibility of a flood,'' McKeon said. ``I
take a little, the river takes a little. I guess we're even now.
I've sold a lot of kayaks and I guess the river is telling me I
need to take a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   In four hours, the Pamlico advanced from its banks and
threatened to cross Main Street. McKeon's Dumpster floated about 50
yards. A Volkswagen started bobbing. But when the storm passed east
of here in the afternoon, a west wind started driving the river
back to the sound and the flooded backstreets of downtown cleared
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Like spots all over eastern North Carolina, residential
sidestreets in Washington were impassable. Drivers tentatively
crept through water deep enough to float small boats and deputies
cautioned motorists to slow down so wakes wouldn't wash into
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn how to drive here. You just know where it's going to
flood,'' said Melody Cutler, who snapped a picture of a flooded
intersection. ``It's going to take some time to drain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pamlico County, on the west side of Pamlico Sound behind the
Outer Banks, officials said wind damage was minimal compared to
Hurricane Fran in 1996. But some low-lying spots had 2 feet of
standing water that flooded houses and carried away refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories emerged from Onslow County, where the New River
flows through Camp LeJeune on the coast midway between Wilmington
and Morehead City. Near Jacksonville, officials recorded between 25
inches and 30 inches of rain over 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Onslow County public relations director Briar Bogin said
flooding can be more aggravating than wind damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times with a flood, there's nothing you can do but
wait,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the foot of the N.C. 210 bridge to North Topsail
Beach on the Onslow County coast was under water. City hall
temporarily was moved to the mainland and residents were issued
re-entry passes to the island.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 17 bridge connecting Washington and Chocowinity was
closed for about four hours Thursday when the storm surge where the
Tar and Pamlico rivers meet flooded the highway. ``Once the water's
drained off, it's ready to use,'' said Allen Lewis, an engineer for
the state transportation department.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Pamlico has been a friend to Washington. The
town became a primary supply port during the Revoluntionary War
after other ports were barricaded. Later, the economy developed
around the harvest of oysters and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   But early Thursday, nervous merchants worried the river had
turned against them. Water lapped at the back of brick buildings on
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   After an overnight curfew expired at daybreak this morning, a
group of men gathered at the Sloan Insurance building on Main
Street overlooking the swollen Pamlico. Given his profession, it
would stand to reason that owner Mike Sloan carries insurance for
potential losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do. But that doesn't make me feel any better,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ron Clark, 53, and his wife moved to Main Street
into a two-story, clapboard house built in 1840. The house has
hardwood floors, ``the whole deal,'' he said. A magnolia tree now 7
feet in diameter and more than 100 feet tall was planted when the
house was built. Old-timers told Clark he'd stay relatively dry
since he was on the high side of the street. Still, Clark didn't
need to go far to see water spilling out of the Pamlico.
</P>
<P>
   He had a small amount of water in his basement from heavy rain
but Clark had no intention of abandoning the house. ``If it's
lasted 160 years, I hope it lasts one more hurricane,'' Clark said.

 &HT;    Development on risky land pays a price
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. _ As he surveyed the damaged roofs,
washed-out foundations and sand-clogged roads in Hurricane Bonnie's
wake, Otis Sizemore slowed in front of his bluish-gray duplex
overlooking the churning gray ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I did fairly well,'' said the North Topsail
Beach alderman, eyeing the plywood he had nailed over the windows
of his home. ``I'm not taking it down yet. I'm not taking any
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   This narrow spit of a town, at the northern end of Topsail
Island between Wilmington and Jacksonville, suffered Hurricane
Fran's most punishing blows two years ago. Largely rebuilt but
still showing scars from North Carolina's most costly natural
disaster, North Topsail Beach escaped Bonnie's strong winds and
tidal surges with far less severe damage than during Fran's strike.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as North Topsail's residents are returning to their
homes after spending two nights in emergency shelters, motels and
other places, they're keeping a worried eye on the forecast for
Danielle, the latest hurricane churning in the Atlantic toward the
Southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very real concern here that if another storm comes up
here, it could do very much harm,'' said Sizemore, 62, who spent
$70,000 on repairs after Fran.
</P>
<P>
   He's relieved that damage seemed confined to roof damage and a
missing garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   But all around Sizemore's duplex, called Surf Royal, extensive
damage illustrated the vulnerability of North Carolina's heavily
developed barrier islands to pounding storms.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the northern end of North Topsail is
considered so risky for building that projects are not eligible for
federal flood protection. Even so, two subdivisions, Dolphin Shores
and Cape Island, are under development.
</P>
<P>
   After Fran, town officials hauled in tons of sand to rebuild the
dunes that had protected water-front houses, apartments and
high-rise condominiums. But on Thursday, Sizemore estimated that
Bonnie had washed away half of the new dunes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, crews scraped sand from the roads and
straightened utility poles. Some sections of N.C. 210 were several
inches deep in water, while a several-block-long stretch of Topsail
Road was covered by sand and littered by remnants of wooden decks.
As he traveled at the island's northern tip, Sizemore defended the
right of people to buy property, as long as they're advised of the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come down here, buy a piece of property, buy insurance,
cross their fingers and go on from there,'' he said as he passed by
a precarious-looking gray house named ``Living on the Edge.'' ``We
do not live out here unaware.''
</P>
<P>
   But the storms are nonetheless frustrating to beach dwellers.
``This is the third one I've been through, and going back is going
to be a big hassle,'' said Luther McCarter, 33, a North Topsail
resident picking up a re-entry pass at Dixon Elementary School in
Sneads Ferry.

CLINTON RETURNS TO PUBLIC ARENA WITH SPEECH ON SCHOOL SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-WOMEN) 
(JT) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Wading into a public arena for the first time
since he admitted to what he called inappropriate behavior with a
White House intern, President Clinton on Thursday received a strong
vote of confidence for his public policies but a mixed review of
his personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left his wife and daughter back at the first family's
vacation retreat on Martha's Vineyard and flew to this Democratic
stronghold Thursday morning for a speech on school safety that his
advisers hoped would help refocus the nation and the news media
away from his private life and onto policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   He attracted a presidential-campaign-size crowd, including
hundreds of onlookers packed along a motorcade route of nearly six
miles from the Worcester airport to the historic Mechanics Hall,
where he addressed an audience of 1,200 people and never referred
to his personal situation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech was delivered before news of the plunging stock
market and the precarious situation of Russia's president, Boris
Yeltsin, and sounded more boiler plate than urgent.
</P>
<P>
   While it was meant to highlight school safety, it grazed over an
assortment of policy items, including the economy, terrorism,
Social Security, school construction and health care.
</P>
<P>
   His decision Monday night to make Worcester his debut city
sparked a burst of hometown pride. And those who heard his speech
gave him sustained applause and standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McGovern, the freshman Democrat who had invited Clinton
here months ago, declared from the stage at Mechanics Hall: ``This
is not a city of fair-weather friends. A friend from Worcester is a
friend for life, and you, president, have been a true friend of
Worcester.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the bunting and resounding applause, many were
careful to distinguish between the president's policies and his
personal life. And signs along the motorcade route were mixed. For
every poster that said ``We support you,''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of you, Mr. President'' or ``We're still with you,
Mr. President,'' others ordered him to ``Resign now!'' or simply
said ``Liar!'' One placard offered a ``Scarlet A.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Whitney, the 63-year-old Democratic mayor of nearby
Fitchburg, who attended the speech after being called by the White
House advance staff, said, ``I have the highest respect for the
office of president.'' But she added that the person in the office
should be a role model for the nation and Clinton ``is not my kind
of role model.'' Another loyal Democrat refused to come. Connie
Lukes, a city councilwoman, boycotted the event, condemning Clinton
and saying, ``The emperor has no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McGovern's wife, Lisa, 39, said she had to separate her
personal feelings about the president from his policies. Sitting in
the front row of Mechanics Hall with her four-month-old son, she
said that she was ``disappointed in what he did personally, but
that won't get in the way _ I'm worried about child care and
education, and he has been great on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, part of the official delegation that greeted
the president and traveled around with him, grew slightly testy
when reporters pressed for his reaction to the president's personal
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say,'' he said, an uncharacteristic
response from a politician who so enjoys the public eye that he is
routinely referred to as John (Live Shot) Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I support what the president is doing'' on school
safety, but when asked whether he supported him personally, he
declined to comment, saying he would address the matter next week
when the Senate returns to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of school safety, Clinton said that every school in
the country would soon receive a copy of a guide to help teachers
and parents recognize troubled children who might be prone to
violence. According to the guide, such signs include social
isolation, bad grades and ``inappropriate access'' to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The president resolutely avoided any mention of his personal
life, despite agreement among many of his advisers that he should
offer more contrition to augment his Aug. 17 admission that he had
an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Thursday, Clinton appeared by turns drained
and relaxed. He shook nearly every hand in sight. And he apparently
felt no need to rush back to Martha's Vineyard, lingering for more
than 1 hour 45 minutes with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and other
Democratic politicians at Scano's Restaurant here where he shed his
suit jacket and downed a ``steak bomb'' submarine sandwich with
french fries.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the restaurant, Mary Scano, a former member of the
City Council, strongly supported Clinton. Asked about his admission
of an improper relationship, she said: ``So he lied. I lie. When I
was on the Council, I lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of people waiting to meet Clinton outside the
restaurant was Charlie Gallagher, 32, an electrician. He said he
wished the president had apologized more, if only to get the whole
thing over with. But, he added: ``He probably didn't do anything
different than any other married man would have done, in terms of
trying to cover up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Moakley, from Boston, who ate lunch with the president,
said that it would be difficult for Clinton to say anything more
about Ms. Lewinsky. ``You don't get a second shot at an apology,''
he said. ``You've got to get it right the first time.'' Asked if
Clinton got it right the first time, Moakley said: ``Almost.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HOMER BUSH IS NO LONGER A MERE MASCOT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of this season, Homer Bush has been a
first-hand witness to the excellence of the New York Yankees, a
25th man with a good view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no weak spots,'' he said Thursday night, somewhat
stunned to be making his second straight start, a consequence of
his crucial home run Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams, you get to their fourth hitter, maybe they have a
good fifth hitter, but then you can pitch around him,'' Bush said,
looking around the clubhouse crammed with talent. ``We've got a
fourth hitter, a fifth, a sixth, a seventh, an eighth. Man, when
does it stop?''
</P>
<P>
   It does not even stop at the 24th man. Bush made the team this
spring on the fault line on the X-ray of Luis Sojo's hand. At
first, he was a marginal player whose sweetness (a word not often
used in baseball these days) radiated around the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys score so many runs, they get tired; that gives me a
chance,'' Bush said. ``I love going into a game to pinch-run. I
don't just jog, I take off running. I love hearing them cheer for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands that some of the cheers are for what he
represents, but he can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   This is his eighth professional season, his first full year in
the majors, and he is overtly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from East St. Louis, Ill., one of eight children, whose
father, a police officer, was shot to death when he was off-duty.
</P>
<P>
   His mother struggled to keep the family together, and now he has
the chance to earn a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring he had a month's grace, he hustled and he hit and he
backed up the infielders, and when Sojo came back, Bush stayed. He
was hitting .362 in 25 games going into Thursday night, and his
biggest hit came in Wednesday's second game, with the Yankees
suffering through a four-game losing streak, and Knee-Jerk City
going into its normal panic.
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on base, Bush was trying to ``maybe drive in a
run with a sacrifice fly.'' He made an educated guess on a
fastball, and saw the outfielders' backs, and said to himself,
``You just hit a big-league home run,'' which he had never done
before.
</P>
<P>
   He pumped his fist and raced home, taking full note that the
first man out of the dugout was Chuck Knoblauch, the regular second
baseman, who was getting a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knobby was talking to me the whole game,'' Bush said. ``He was
telling me what to expect out there. That made it easier, inning by
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would know if somebody was mad because you were playing,
but that's the thing about this team. He's making six million fish
and he's excited for me. You don't have anybody hoping you fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody sent a couple of ushers to bargain with the fan who had
captured Bush's ball. They said they would accept a ``gamer'' bat
in return for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving them a bat from Derek Jeter or Bernie Williams, one
of the stars,'' Bush said, quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Monahan, the Yankee trainer, later presented him with the
ball, enclosed in a clear plastic case, with the words ``1st Major
League Home Run vs. Sparks 8-26-98 Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed at the ball and said, ``Look, it's lopsided,'' then
gave a smile that could light up the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Bush went out to the Garden State Mall in Paramus,
N.J., and was proud when people asked for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using all of this as a learning tool,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can contribute to this team, I can play anywhere in the
major leagues, whatever the situation happens to be. My stock has
gone up. At least, that's how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He watches what the regulars do:
</P>
<P>
   ``Clutch hitters. We had that brawl with Baltimore, and Bernie
comes back and hits a home run and then Tim Raines follows with
another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plays Scott Brosius makes at third base. These guys make
it look easy, but I see the bad side. They get upset if they have a
bad game. This game is not as easy as they make it seem.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Joe Torre decided to rest Brosius, who had played
both games Wednesday, and he started Bush, who had played only one
game at third.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters told him he was in the starting lineup, Bush
said, ``Oh, yeah.'' Then he checked, and found it was true. It's
that kind of season. The 25th man can play, too.

FBI, TEXAS RANGERS INVESTIGATING TEXAS HOUSING OFFICIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state housing official is under investigation
by the FBI and the Texas Rangers in an alleged scheme to profit
from federal low-income housing money she oversees, according to
court documents and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Florita Bell Griffin, a member of the board that oversees the
Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, is one of
several Bryan residents accused of an elaborate conspiracy to
improperly obtain federal funds aimed at building homes for the
poor, documents filed in a flurry of lawsuits in Bryan show. She
denies any wrongdoing
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically, I am investigating allegations that these
individuals participated in a scheme to fraudulently receive tax
credits, down payment assistance, real estate acquisition, and
interim construction financing from a state agency. . .,'' FBI
agent Robert W. Martin said in a sworn affidavit last May seeking a
warrant to search Griffin's two-story home in Bryan for documents.
</P>
<P>
   Martin cited a tape-recorded meeting, a handwritten note on how
to divide certain profits and other evidence in the FBI's
possession, and said there was probable cause to believe Griffin
and her partners engaged in several federal offenses. These include
theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds,
conspiracy to defraud the United States and aiding or abetting in
such criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Griffin is accused of using her influence as a
public official to approve federal subsidies for low-income real
estate deals in which she had a secret interest. She has also been
sued by a Fort Worth-area developer who claims she secretly plotted
with others to defraud him. In turn, she filed her own libel and
slander lawsuit against him and another FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those allegations that were made are absolutely untrue
and will be proven to be untrue if necessary. I would hate to have
my reputation ruined,'' said Griffin, formerly a Bryan city planner
and lecturer at Texas A&AMP;M University's department of landscape
architecture and urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin was appointed by Gov. George W. Bush in 1995 as one of
nine members of the board that oversees housing and community
affairs department, which awards government subsidies for projects
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin and others, noting that they are subjects of a criminal
investigation, have declined to produce documents or give oral
depositions in the related civil suit, asserting their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is doing their job. It's an ongoing investigation,''
said Sam Adamo, Griffin's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI probe includes ``serious and complex allegations
involving a potential conflict of interest,'' said Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes. She said the governor's office called the Texas
Rangers into the investigation shortly after learning of the
allegations April 27 from another housing board member.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the governor's office has been told that the federal
investigation might be completed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FBI asked Bush's office not to remove
Griffin from the housing board or to take any other action that
could interfere with the criminal investigation, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the probe have swirled within the housing
department for weeks, said the agency's outgoing executive director
Larry P. Manley.
</P>
<P>
   Manley resigned his own post this week amid criticisms, which he
calls unfair and untrue, that Texas could lose federal money that
the agency did not allocate to low-income housing projects quickly
enough. He said his resignation was unrelated to questions about
the agency's handling of federal funds, including the criminal
investigation of Griffin. His plan is to return to private
business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no obvious violation of any laws based on what we've
seen here,`` Manley said. ''I don't know anything about what's
going on in this whole FBI analysis. We're making referrals where
appropriate and then we're out of the picture.``
</P>
<P>
   Court documents and records at the housing agency show that
Griffin participated in two favorable board votes in 1997 to award
federal tax credits for an apartment project in Bryan called One
Golden Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mitchell of Tarrant County has claimed in a civil
lawsuit and to federal law enforcement authorities that he was
victimized in an ``incredible conspiratorial fraud'' in which
Griffin secretly participated in One Golden Oaks and hid part of
her personal share in a company called Arkofa Consulting. Also
involved in the alleged scheme were Terry Roberts, Joe Lee Walker
and Barry Hammond, all of Bryan, according to the FBI affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, FBI agent Martin said Griffin is accused of
buying a block of land for the apartment project along with
Roberts, Walker and Hammond as secret partners in a company called
B. Hammond Homes Inc. Mitchell was led to believe the land actually
cost $15,000 an acre and agreed to pay that amount for 23 acres.
What he did not know is that the secret partners had already bought
the land as part of a larger 131-acre block for only $2,000 an
acre.
</P>
<P>
   The secret partners allegedly came away with parcels of roughly
28 acres each and placed the titles under names of relatives and
Arkofa. Hammond, who later agreed to act as an FBI informant,
placed his property in his own name. A handwritten note, cited by
the FBI as showing how profits from a subsequent deal involving the
land would be divided, indicate that Griffin took part of her
earnings in the form of home repairs performed by Hammond, a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal the FBI is investigating, Griffin, Hammond,
Roberts and Walker are accused of seeking federal assistance for a
single-family home development in Bryan called Shadow Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond told the FBI that Griffin was involved in that deal from
the start and ``stated on several occasions throughout the spring
and summer of 1997 that Shadow Wood would receive board approval
for (Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs)
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's libel and slander suit against Mitchell and Hammond
denies that she was a secret investor in B. Hammond Homes, that she
participated in secret meetings or that she had hidden any interest
in deals under a corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   She asserted that Hammond made defamatory statements in a
publication in a ``drug-induced false belief'' that she and Walker
were trying to defraud him. Griffin doesn't name the publication
that printed Hammond's allegations and doesn't elaborate on the
issue of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly question the credibility of her two accusers.
They have their motives for saying what they've said,'' Adamo,
Griffin's attorney said. &QL;

ELATED NORTH CAROLINA OFFICIALS EXPRESS RELIEF OVER MINOR HURRICANE
DAMAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHOCOWINITY, N.C. _ Big Al Crisp is one unlucky guy.
</P>
<P>
   While most residents of North Carolina's coastline breathed a
sigh of relief Thursday, emerging from houses and shelters to
discover minimal damage by Hurricane Bonnie, Crisp was wading
through waist deep water inspecting his flooded business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said looking out over his waterlogged inventory
of recreational vehicles. ``I tell you, it's sad. This is the third
time one of these storms has done this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for most everyone else, Crisp was in the minority
Thursday, one of the few with the unpleasant task of counting their
losses rather than their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Bonnie churned through the Atlantic Ocean off the
North Carolina coast three days ago, it was a Category 3 storm 400
miles wide with winds of 115 mph. Many feared it would cause severe
damage to an area that had barely begun to heal from the last big
storm.
</P>
<P>
   But as it weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to sea
Thursday, state officials expressed relief that damage to
structures, to fragile beaches, to trees, to power lines were all
being tallied in the ``minor'' column.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they were elated that Bonnie had caused no loss of
life or serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's amazing, really,'' said Susan Perkins, a spokeswoman
for the state division of emergency management. ``People here are
surprised and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm in the early afternoon
Thursday after coming ashore 24 hours earlier near Cape Fear and
then tracking slowly up the North Carolina coast, dumping sheets of
rain. Wilmington, the biggest city in its path, received upward of
8 inches, and forecasters had predicted as much as 20 inches could
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Bonnie was moving so slowly, anywhere between 4
mph and 8 mph after landfall, led officials to express concern that
severe flooding would occur. And while the rain did fall in sheets,
the only significant flooding occurred along the banks of the
Pamlico River near the city of Washington, and it was caused by
storm surge, not rain.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are still so fresh in the minds of many residents
here, Bonnie was often compared to hurricanes Fran and Bertha,
which struck in 1996
</P>
<P>
   Fran and Bertha both sent water into the basement of dentist
Jeff Rumley's house on the Pamlico River, a house built in 1874 by
a North Carolina lumber baron and which, presumably, has weathered
many such storms. Bonnie failed to measure up to her predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was nothing like it was with Fran,'' Rumley said. ``This
(water) came in real slow and it's starting to leave real fast. It
didn't push in like Frank and break things as it went. It just rose
real slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 miles away, near Cape Carteret, Claude Murdoch, a
67-year-old, ``semi-retired'' mechanic had already mopped the mud
off the floor of his modest house on the shores of the Intracoastal
Waterway. The flood damage to his place was also the result of
storm surge, which had further damaged the pier he is trying to
build that keeps getting torn up by hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and her (his wife Jessie B. Murdoch), we mopped it real
good,'' Murdoch said as the winds whipped the sound behind him into
dancing whitecaps. ``She's got cancer real bad. I still got damage
from Fran I ain't ever fixed. I would have if I didn't have to work
to pay for her radiation treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   By later afternoon, convoys of power company trucks headed into
the hurricane area from their staging area in Raleigh, ready to
restore power to the 250,000 people still without it. Convoys of
National Guard troops also were headed to the coast to offer their
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Thursday declared 10 North Carolina
counties disaster areas, an act that opens the federal financial
spigots and which will help those whose property was damaged by the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt was to take a helicopter tour
Friday of the area affected by Bonnie. It will probably be
Saturday, state officials said, before state and federal teams from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency can do a detailed
inspection of damage. Until that happens, they said, it is not
possible to provide an estimate of the amount of damage caused.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary reports coming in from some of the beaches
closed during the storm indicated damage to houses and beaches was
not severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structural damage seems to be sort of minor,'' said Perkins.
``It appears there is some beach erosion, some roofs ripped off,
some flooding in some of the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins and other state officials attribute the lack of deaths
or serious injuries to the mass evacuations. The majority of people
asked to leave the area Tuesday obeyed, heading inland to
relatives, hotels or one of the shelters set up by the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday evening, Perkins said, 11,500 people remained in
shelters, but they were heading home in increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Big Al Crisp? Well if his insurance company pays him like
they have twice before, he will stay where he is, he said, where he
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can replace property,'' he said. ``But you can't replace
life.''

FOR TV CREWS, COVERING STORM MEANS GETTING WET
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.C., Va.)  (See also: HURRICANE-BONNIE) 
(jw) 
 By RICK BRAGG 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ Beside an overturned basketball goal in Moorehead
City, N.C., Jim Cantore abandoned the comparative safety of his
Weather Channel ``live'' truck, planted his feet, squinted one eye
against the blowing rain and, with his pants legs flapping madly
and the wind itself rushing into the microphone, brought Hurricane
Bonnie into America's living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On a trembling dock in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., Kerry Sanders,
an NBC correspondent, braced himself against a boat's mast and,
apparently in some danger of being blown into the surging water,
went live with the news that the storm's winds had reached almost
70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In a parking lot in Wilmington, N.C., protected from the wind
but not rain by a hotel wall, a bedraggled-looking Martin Savidge
gave periodic updates to CNN viewers while shelter waited just
steps away.
</P>
<P>
   And in Nags Head, N.C., his face peppered by stinging rain and
sand, Jeff Morrow of the Weather Channel stood before heaving waves
and warned of worse to come as his cameraman wiped water off the
lens with a rag.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so dramatic here on the southern East Coast,
as television crews from around the dial tracked Bonnie's fury _ or
lack of _ over the past two days. Aerial views on some channels
showed the same damaged house over and over and the same overturned
tree was brought to America's attention again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But, from networks like CNN and the Weather Channel, whose
viewership often rises significantly in times of crisis, to local
stations who dispatched dozens of reporters to stand at the water's
edge and give stern warnings of a catastrophe that never came, one
thing was clear:
</P>
<P>
   The only way to cover weather is to stand in it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the best way, forecasters say, to impress upon viewers the
importance and danger of what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell it like it is,'' said Cantore, who has loved the
science of weather since he was a boy in New England, jumping in
rain puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the camera's eye shows people the rushing
surf, the waving trees, the downed power lines, all the things that
could kill.
</P>
<P>
   It tells people why it is important to leave when a sheriff's
deputy knocks on the door and informs them of a ``mandatory
evacuation,'' something many homeowners and even tourists ignore,
forecaster said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``stand-up'' in gale-force winds has another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to stay with the program than go to the
clicker,'' if they see someone out in it, someone apparently
braving the elements, said Jack Loftus, vice president of
communications for Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to communicate it from the safety of studio,
but it's another to put it on the line, to put yourself in harm's
way,'' he said. ``It gets pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1.5 million households had tuned into the Weather
Channel as the storm bore down on the North Carolina coast. The
Weather Channel's average audience, in good weather, is about
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Cantore's presence here in harm's way on the southern
East Coast, not the calibrations and prognostications at the home
office of the Weather Channel back in Marietta, Ga., that holds the
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters from CNN, the Weather Channel and other networks
said they would not place one of their reporters in peril for a
live shot, and stressed that reporters more often set up their
camera's far from the coastline, usually across barrier islands,
when high winds threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never put them in harm's way,'' said Connie Malko, a
senior publicist for the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers do have at least the impression that the reporter is
going someplace that they would probably not go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's serious stuff,'' Loftus said of the live broadcasts,
``when you see somebody out there, right on the beach or boardwalk.
That does rivet your attention, partly because you want to see if
he gets blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantore said it negated the credibility of the newscast to take
foolish chances, or hype a weather system that had become less
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as he did his stand-up as Hurricane Bonnie faded from
hurricane to tropical storm, he picked a place where the wind blew
in off an inlet and contained no flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   There are always some risks, he said, but the secret is to avoid
foolish ones, while still being close enough to the storm's eye to
convey its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remove myself from the protection of the live
truck,'' he said Thursday morning, taking the viewer with him out
into the 60-mph gusts as the storm finally began to weaken.
``That's a pretty good gust right there,'' he said, leaning into
the wind, only wobbling a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about 60,'' he said, and it is no wild guess. Cantore
is a trained meteorologist, what he calls a field meteorologist,
and this week, he has been on more television sets than Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His Weather Channel has become the hot ticket item on the
Weather Service web page, where people can order Weather Channel
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with weather,'' said Cantore, who has had only
a few hours' sleep over the past week. For lunch on Thursday, he
had an orange, Milano cookies and Frosted Mini Wheats, covered in
Cheese Whiz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a big kid who loves to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But he understands how dangerous weather is. He tells the story
of how he once watched floodwaters cover over his live truck as he
watched from a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Local television crews seemed determined to emulate the networks
in their coverage, by sending people in rain gear out to the
beaches _ even though it looked a little silly as people in shorts
and T-shirts frolicked in the light rain around them.

 &HT;    Multinationals, market feel Moscow's crunch
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Russian and Asian economic and currency crises
weigh heavily on the minds of skittish investors, and they didn't
hesitate to unload shares of multinational companies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, whose stock was
downgraded by an analyst who said the company's reliance on
international markets make it increasingly vulnerable to currency
gyrations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock fell $4.43 3/4 in heavy trading to close at
$74.75 on a day it and other multinationals sent the Dow Jones
industrial average tumbling 357.36 points. The index is now 1,171
points below its record 9,337.97 set on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors are concerned that weakening economies in
Russia, Asia and emerging markets may make it more difficult for
Coca-Cola and other companies doing business around the world to
continue their strong profit growth. Coca-Cola does business in 197
countries and gets 70 percent of its sales and 75 percent of its
profit from international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is just the latest in a series of crises or adverse
events in emerging markets,'' said Douglas M. Lane, a beverage
analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities. ``Maybe it was the
final straw, but I want to stress that it's much more widespread
than just Russia.''

 &HT;    U.S. economy OK, but world situation raising some fears
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The U.S. economy is an island of strength in a
widening sea of foreign economic and currency failure, but it's by
no means clear how long that will last.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the greatest danger is that the current disarray in
international economic leadership could make a bad situation
disastrous. The result could be a U.S. recession, so far regarded
as unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton hasn't got any business going to Russia to
meet with (President Boris) Yeltsin. He should call a meeting of
G-7 (industrial) nations to hammer out a plan,'' said Georgia State
University economist Donald Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   He said the chief financial problem facing Asia, Russia and
elsewhere is the lack of lending capacity by the International
Monetary Fund and major foreign banks, essential to keep those
economies going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big shock is not that Russia is defaulting, but that the
IMF can't help them,'' said Ratajczak. ``That means they can't give
any more help to Asia and Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that U.S. banks are still strong, with the
lending power needed to service a growing U.S. economy _ which
government figures showed on Thursday to be stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not too late to stop the avalanche of
global economic failure before it reaches the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for investors, but the big question is still
how much and how long these foreign problems will affect the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the seriousness of the foreign threat has
been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is vastly over-reacting to the risks to our
economy from foreign problems,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief
strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts were forecasting a slowdown in the bull market
even before the Asian crisis surfaced last year, based on the
longer-range prospect for slower U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, say analysts, is that investors may have known
that profits would slow, but only reacted when the actual slowdown
showed up in first- and second-quarter corporate earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call, the earnings of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
companies grew about 3.4 percent in the second quarter against the
comparable 1997 numbers, or about the same as in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As estimates for the third quarter continue to be revised
downward, the odds continue to rise that third-quarter earnings
will be similar to the last two quarters,'' said First Call
Research Director Charles L. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While it took foreign economic problems to trigger this year's
sell-off in stocks, analysts say the severity of the decline was a
product not only of slower earnings growth but high stock
valuations.
</P>
<P>
   The price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is 25.
Historically, it should be 15. And many individual stocks have P/Es
that are far above that of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had long feared that overvaluation, coupled with the
length of the 1990s bull market, would greatly worsen the sell-off
when it came.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that's what happened: 63 percent of all stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange are down 20 percent or more
from their 52-week highs, and 48 percent are down 25 percent or
more, according to industry research.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are divided over how long this correction will last,
and how far the indexes will fall. But most agree it's the kind of
pain that investors have been warned about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wisdom of dip buying is being put to the test,'' said
Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Arnold Kaufman in a Web site report.
``The recent series of failed rally attempts has immobilized buyers
for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these threats to the market, the mood among some leading
Wall Street analysts is still fundamentally upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kaufman, ``the decline won't cascade from here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual investors, many of whom intend to stay with
automatic stock buying via 401(k) programs, should soon come to the
market's rescue,'' said Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman reiterated his forecast that the Dow will bottom out at
about 8,000 _ only 166 points from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommended some buying about 20 minutes ago,'' he said
Thursday when called.

SALE OF DeBARTOLO TRACKS CALLED OFF 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sale of horse racetracks Louisiana Downs, Remington Park and
Thistledown was called off late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Call Now Inc., a publicly held company with a subsidiary that
operates Retama Park horse track in suburban San Antonio, put down
a refundable $2 million deposit in July in a bid to buy the tracks
from the Ohio-based DeBartolo Corp. for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was contingent on Call Now securing financing for
the purchase, and that apparently never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Call Now chairman William Allen and his son-in-law, company
president Bryan Brown, could not be reached for comment. Call Now
headquarters was recently relocated to San Antonio from Miami
Shores, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mutual agreement,'' said John York, the senior vice
president of the DeBartolo Racing division. ``Both of us worked
hard trying to get it done, but it simply wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're neither sad nor glad this thing has ended. Everyone
should know that it's business as usual at DeBartolo Racing.''
</P>
<P>
   York said that Call Now was satisfied with the operation of the
tracks, and that DeBartolo Racing was satisfied with the company's
due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   But although York would not elaborate, problems with financing
became apparent this week. Call Now failed to respond to requests
by the Louisiana and Oklahoma racing commissions for basic
information such as Social Security numbers of Call Now principals,
so that mandatory background checks could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in horse racing at the DeBartolo Corp. has visibly
waned since the December 1994 death of founder Edward DeBartolo
Sr., a fan of the sport who loved to bet on horses.
</P>
<P>
   York said published industry reports that the corporation has
been ``openly peddling the tracks'' since DeBartolo's death are
untrue. However, York said that after news of Call Now's interest
in buying the tracks was made public, other groups stepped forward
to express possible interest as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not those people will resurface now, I don't
know,'' York said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Downs, acquired in the mid-1970s by DeBartolo, is
located in Bossier City and has been the most profitable of the
three tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Remington Park in Oklahoma City was built by the company in 1988
at a cost of $94 million but has lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Thistledown in suburban Cleveland, a minor-league track located
near the DeBartolo corporate headquarters of Youngstown, was the
company's first racing venture, purchased in 1961.

<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Two years ago, residents of this
surfside resort just east of Wilmington returned to their island
after the passing of Hurricane Fran and found utter devastation.
Sand dunes were flattened. Beachfront houses were swamped. Boats
were tossed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   They found none of that Thursday as they streamed back to survey
the damage from Hurricane Bonnie, which blew through this area on
Wednesday afternoon. A few shingles were missing, a few dwellings
and businesses had water damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dunes, artificially replenished earlier this year, had lost
a bit of sand. A single small boat, the Bahama Gem, had been lifted
out of the marsh and deposited on a muddy bank. Even the Shell
Island Resort, a beachfront condominium that is close to falling
into the sea, suffered little noticeable damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate,'' said Ed Taylor, an assistant to the
town manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, just south of Wilmington, officials
expressed amazement at the dearth of significant destruction.
``It's totally unreal, especially as big as this hurricane was and
as long as it hung around,'' said Cecil Logan, a spokesman for the
county's disaster services. That was the sentiment up and down the
North Carolina coast Thursday as coastal residents, waterlogged but
relieved, awoke to the realization that Hurricane Bonnie had not
lived up to her advance notices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Hurricane Center reported that the
category 3 storm carried maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, there
were few physical signs that its power had been that intense. Some
longtime residents said they had developed an ear for hurricanes,
and could tell from the sound of the hurricane that it would not be
as destructive as Fran, which caused nearly $6 billion in property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said it was too early to make a dollar
assessment of the damage from the latest hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Gore, a 66-year-old lawyer who has lived for 33 years on
the Cape Fear River in Southport, said that really bad storms would
progress from whistling to howling to roaring to screeching to
screaming. ``We had screeching but we didn't have as much of it as
with Fran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday,
with winds of 70 mph slowly churning northward through eastern
North Carolina, there were still no reports of deaths or serious
injuries from it. Many of the injuries that were reported by area
hospitals, including electric shocks and carbon monoxide poisoning,
resulted from the improper use of generators.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, plenty of ecological consequences,
particularly for sand dunes and rain-sodden rivers. The Pamlico
River washed over its banks in places near Washington, N.C., as did
the Neuse River in New Bern, where major highways were closed. Many
cities in the region received between nine and 11 inches of
rainfall in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Carolina Beach, just south of here, close to where
the eye of the storm made landfall, reported that several feet of
sand had washed ashore on the north end of their island.
</P>
<P>
   At North Topsail Beach, early assessments indicated that 60
percent of the dunes had washed away, some in half-mile long
chunks. On one end of the island, a truck was buried in sand to the
tops of its tires. Boardwalks were twisted and torn away and some
houses were perched precariously near the edge of the water,
because of beach and dune erosion.
</P>
<P>
   North Topsail Beach, with the help of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, had spent $2 million replenishing the dunes
blown away by Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to start over again,'' said Tony
Hammond, the town manager. ``The ones that had the vegetation
seemed to have held up better. The ones with limited vegetation
didn't do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton declared North Carolina a
disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance like loans
to farmers and emergency assistance for food and clothing. The aid
was announced in a telephone call between Gov. James Hunt Jr. and
White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who has said he is
considering a campaign for governor of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Aguirre, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said that the center of storm was near Elizabeth
City early this evening and was expected to move to the Northeast
and eventually into the Atlantic at about 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   He said another hurricane, Danielle, was ``following behind on
the heels of Bonnie'' in the Atlantic with winds approaching 90
mph. He said it was too soon to predict the storm's path as it
nears the United States. Almost everyone here suffered some
inconvenience from the hurricane, but little more. As of 4 p.m.
Thursday, some 248,000 households and businesses remained without
electricity in eastern North Carolina, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on many barrier islands kept bridges closed,
preventing evacuated residents from returning to their homes,
because they were still checking for downed power lines and for
damage to water and sewage systems. As they waited for hours at a
checkpoint at the foot of the bridge to Carolina Beach, many
residents could not hide their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave again,'' said J. Nicole Haywood. ``I may die in
the next one, but I won't leave. This just irks me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a day without power, many residents were
desperate for hot showers and hot meals. At Johnny's Deli and New
York Style Pizzeria, one of the first restaurants in Wilmington to
open Thursday morning, a line of eager customers stretched out the
door at 11 a.m. Pizza for brunch? Why not, said Wendy R. Kulp, a
22-year-old Wilmington woman who survived the hurricane on a diet
of potato chips and apples. ``I heard on the radio that it was
open,'' she said. ``We looked it up in the yellow pages and rushed
over here as fast as we could. The thought of hot food and cooked
cheese sounds really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Others waiting for pizza said they were happy to get outside
after spending Wednesday trapped indoors. ``I'm really sick of
talking to them,'' said Tracey Hopkins, gesturing toward her two
roommates. ``And we've done all the crossword puzzles in People
magazine for the last three months.''

 &HT;    Low injuries, costs bring sighs of relief
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunny skies were expected to brighten North Carolina today as
people start cleaning up after Bonnie, the much-anticipated monster
hurricane that bullied the coast but proved to be little more than
a big, wet bag of wind.
</P>
<P>
   The damage appears minimal, with preliminary estimates at less
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties, too, appeared slight. In Hyde County, a man was cut
when a window broke and a firefighter was injured when a wall
collapsed on him during an electrical fire. Neither injury was
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   There was some flooding, about 10,000 people remained in
shelters, and 276,500 people didn't have electricity Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to Hurricane Fran in September 1996. That storm
turned into North Carolina's costliest disaster when, instead of
turning north, it plowed through the middle of the state, causing
$5.2 billion in damage and 22 deaths. The state was just recovering
from Hurricane Bertha, which had hit two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, slow-moving Bonnie may be best remembered as a boon
for scientists who were trying to learn more about hurricanes'
behavior by circling the storm in a converted Air Force spy plane,
getting previously unavailable views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got to have a hurricane, this is the kind of
hurricane you want to have,'' said Capt. John Williams, the Coast
Guard's commanding officer of the ports of Wilmington and Morehead
City after inspecting damage.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Bonnie's winds had fallen to 65 mph, but
the coast did take a pounding with hours of heavy rain. The storm
drenched Jacksonville with 10.4 inches of rain. Wilmington, which
was in Bonnie's cross hairs Wednesday, got 9 inches, Greenville,
7.6, and Emerald Isle, 6.7.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was expected to have moved offshore by today.

RUSSIA WOE JOLTS WORLD, US MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US stock market tumbled by more than 350 points Thursday,
caving in to the deepening crisis in Russia that hammered virtually
every other stock market in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After withstanding the bad news emanating from Russia all week,
the Dow Jones industrial average registered its third-biggest point
drop in history, plunging 357.36 points, or 4.2 percent, to
8,165.99 in the second-heaviest trading day ever. In percentage
terms, the decline was the worst since Oct. 27, 1997, when waves of
bad news in Asian financial markets took their toll in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, from Tokyo to Madrid to Caracas, stock markets in
industrial and emerging countries fell like dominoes, shaken by
Russia's instability and continued concerns about Japan's economic
gridlock. Adding to the financial turmoil, prices of commodities
plunged to a 21-year lows before recovering slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in the capital markets 15 years, and I've
never seen anything as widespread as this,'' said Mark Madden, an
international portfolio manager for Pioneer Mutual Funds in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While stocks tumbled, investors flocked to US Treasury bonds, a
haven for international investors in times of uncertainty. Prices
on 30-year Treasury bonds soared. Yields, which move inversely with
bond prices and which influence interest rates on loans, fell to
5.34 percent. That is the lowest closing yield since the government
began regular sales of bonds 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors are expected to be extremely nervous
today amid fears that the long-running bull market in stocks may be
ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is off 12.6 percent from its July 17 record of 9337.97,
exceeding the 10 percent loss that marks an official stock market
correction.
</P>
<P>
   The market seemed to hit bottom numerous times during the day.
After a hectic morning of selling, the Dow dropped by 353 points
before recovering somewhat. At noon, it was down just over 275
points but fell further during the day. By around 3:30, as it
showed signs of calming down, it plunged further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kept testing the low and then it went right through it,''
said Lawrence Horwitz, managing director of Primark Decision
Economics in Boston. ``Russia with its big political presence was a
big factor in that. The problems there opened a lot of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of evidence for investors searching for trouble
spots in currencies and stock markets worldwide. In Russia, where
rumors of President Boris Yeltsin's downfall are raging and a
meltdown of the ruble has occurred, the Russian Trading System
index fell 17.13 percent to end at its lowest recorded level since
its introduction in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market drops Thursday started in Japan and continued
westward.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks fell by 3.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern European markets, which are directly tied to Russia,
stock market indexes plunged as international investors divested
their holdings after Russia this week announced a debt
restructuring plan that forces investors to accept huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Western Europe, Spain's stock index, the IBEX 35, suffered
the biggest decline because of its business ties with Latin
America, where markets were also down again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers noted that connections between European companies
and emerging markets are a weak spot. For example, Germany's
biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, which is a lender in Russia, lost 7
percent of its value Thursday. The DAX index in Germany fell 4.48
percent. London's FT-SE fell 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's index, the Sao Paulo Bovespa, fell 10 percent to its
lowest level since Nov. 21, 1996, while Mexico's Bolsa index was
down more than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, investors who took their cues from
Russia's crisis also were reacting to a potent mix of economic
worries. Japan has failed to resolve a severe banking crisis.
Economic woes in Russia and Asia may be spreading to Europe and
Latin America, and could shake the US economy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a fear you're going to end up with a global
recession from all this mess,'' said Robert MacIntosh, portfolio
manager for Eaton Vance Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues swamped
advancing issues 2,872 to 360 on volume of 934 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of blue-chip companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and J.P.
Morgan, which have extensive international operations, were
hammered. But declines were distributed across virtually every
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite slumped 81.72 points, or
4.6 percent, to 1,686.41, the second-biggest point decline in that
market's history.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Thursday that the nation's economic growth
cooled to a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter. The
report, which was no surprise to economists, played little role in
the market's dive.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, portfolio managers and market watchers said
individual investors were remarkably calm. Much of the selling was
by managers of hedge funds selling their high-risk stocks or by
Wall Street brokerage firms unloading stocks. The NYSE did not fall
enough to set off the automatic circuit breakers put in place after
the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense of panic as there have been in previous down
markets. The systems all work. People are just selling stuff,''
said Giles McNamee, an investment banker with FAC Equities in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The US stock market has been sky-high for months and due for a
fall, said Kenneth Heebner, portfolio manager for CGM Funds in
Boston. Stock prices have been trading at astronomical levels of 23
to 25 times their estimated earnings, he said. The historic rate is
about 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan led the Dow's decliners, down 7 1/8 to 110 13/16,
and Citicorp was down 7 3/8 at 126 1/2. Global consumer companies
also took a hit. Coca-Cola fell 4 7/16, closing at 74 3/4. Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. declined 2 5/16, closing at 80 9/16. Gillette was off
1 5/8, closing at 43 1/4.

CONGO'S WAR TURNS TO BRUTAL KILLINGS ON KINSHASA'S STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Even as the fighting just outside the capital
diminished Thursday, the government severely tightened security,
and evidence emerged that civilians and soldiers had brutally
killed several suspected rebel infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, government officials sounded a triumphant note,
holding two news conferences in which they attacked Rwanda and
Uganda, the countries that propelled Laurent Kabila to the
presidency less than two years ago but that are now backing the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At one news conference, Kabila's Cabinet chief, Abdoulaye
Yerodia, said more than 1,000 prisoners had been captured,
including some in a eucalyptus field near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were even some up in the trees _ all naked,'' Yerodia
said in a hourlong news conference, which he ended by sticking a
big cigar in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The government's claims were difficult to verify because
soldiers forbade foreign reporters staying at two hotels from
leaving their buildings and kept the city under tight control.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers severely restricted access to streets, erecting
checkpoints every several hundred feet and demanding to see
people's identification cards and car registration documents, said
hotel workers and taxi drivers who had traveled in from the area
outside the city's diplomatic and business center.
</P>
<P>
   The government's actions were apparently aimed at identifying
potential rebels who had infiltrated the city. And in keeping with
that goal, government soldiers and local police officers wore their
shirts inside-out to distinguish themselves from possible
impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the World Health Organization here said that
Kinshasa's hospitals were overwhelmed with wounded, and that
fighting prevented the delivery of crucial medical supplies from
Brazzaville, across the river in the neighboring Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The government carefully massaged the messages it wanted the
world to see from Kinshasa Thursday, organizing two trips for a few
reporters. The first trip, by helicopter, seemed intended to
demonstrate that the government controlled the airport, 17 miles
southeast of the city's center, although gunfire could be heard
nearby. The sounds of heavy shelling and gunfire that were heard in
Kinshasa for several hours on Wednesday, however, died down
Thursday, as government officials said their forces were clearing
remnants of rebel forces from the airport area.
</P>
<P>
   The message the government wanted to convey with the second trip
was less clear, though potentially much more explosive. In late
afternoon, government soldiers escorted a pool photographer to
certain neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   On a road to the airport, the pool photographer reported seeing
at least 10 charred bodies of what were said to be rebels, as a
crowd of local residents claimed credit for the killings. In
another area, the photographer shot pictures of government soldiers
tossing a living man over a bridge and shooting him with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's popular justice,'' the soldiers said, accusing the
Rwandans of bringing hate into the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of this civil war on Aug. 2, government
propaganda has focused on stirring up the deep historic resentment
of the ethnic Tutsi of eastern Congo, who are leading this
rebellion, and the Rwandan Tutsi, who most Western diplomats
believe are backing them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two groups, along with Uganda, are the ones who yanked
Kabila from obscurity to lead a successful rebellion against Mobutu
Sese Seko, the longtime dictator of this country, which he had
named Zaire. So at the beginning of his presidency, Kabila had
several top aides who were Tutsi, but he eventually cut his ties
with them, when their roles in the government made him unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kinshasa, many Congolese express open hatred of the
ethnic Tutsi in eastern Congo. And the government has increased
popular support for the war by portraying it explicitly as an
attempted foreign invasion by Rwandan Tutsi and Congo's tiny Tutsi
minority.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to determine whether the rebels killed
Thursday in public were ethnic Tutsi. Government officials had said
on Wednesday that most of the rebel infiltrators appeared to be
Congolese, former soldiers in Mobutu's army, who joined the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the dead men's ethnicity, the message was interpreted
by Rwanda as an attack on Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   The previous civil war that brought Kabila to power had its
roots in the ethnic conflicts between Hutu and Tutsi that exploded
into massacres in Rwanda in 1994. Hutu hard-liners, who had
organized the killings of an estimated half-million Tutsi and some
moderate Hutu, fled into refugee camps in Congo. They used the
camps as bases to launch attacks on Rwanda, and in 1996, Rwanda's
Tutsi-led government backed Kabila's uprising hoping it would empty
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   But Rwanda, as well as Uganda, has complained that Kabila has
failed in keeping peace in its border areas. Rwanda has also
complained that Kabila has not guaranteed the safety of the ethnic
Tutsi living in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels now control most cities in eastern Congo, but have
lost their ascendancy in the region southwest of Kinshasa. Soon
after the start of the insurrection, rebels flew more than 1,000
miles from eastern Congo to its westernmost point, and began a
seemingly unstoppable march into Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels' fortunes changed after the war began widening
into a regional conflict, as Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia began
buttressing Kabila's poorly organized army with arms and
battle-hardened troops. With the influx of troops and arms, the
government's forces have gained the upper hand in the region
southwest of the capital. With their allies, the government's
forces are expected to soon eliminate the rebel presence in the
southwest. The rebels still control key points southwest of here:
the port city of Matadi and the huge Inga hydroelectric dam, which
feeds power to the Kinshasa region.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lack of power and the interruption of shipments
along the Congo River, the capital's gas stations were closed
Thursday, residents said. Youths who sell gasoline on
street-corners by the gallon _ known here as Little Gadhafis _ had
raised the price, taxi drivers said. And residents said the price
of food had tripled everywhere because of scarcity.

DOES CHERNOMYRDIN'S POLITICAL STRATEGY MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE?

(bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his drive to consolidate his power, Viktor
Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the fall of
the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between the
remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from the
ashes of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has sent unmistakable signals that he wants to form
a coalition government that embraces tycoons and Communists alike.
But the final outcome of that effort to reconcile such opposing
forces is by no means clear, and the politics of Chernomyrdin's
coalition-building is at odds with the economic crisis in which
Russia finds itself.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, how can Chernomyrdin be all things to all men and
still make the tough decisions that will enable Russia to extract
itself from the rapidly escalating economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most difficult questions for him,''
observed Boris Nemtsov, a reform-minded former Kremlin aide who was
part of the government that was dismissed this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One the one hand he has to organize a strong and professional
government to avoid big failures and big mistakes,'' Nemtsov added.
``On the other hand, he has to compromise with the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing the short-term political logic behind
Chernomyrdin's hints about a coalition government _ or as he puts
it a ``government of accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's appointment as prime minister needs the approval
of the Communist-dominated Parliament. To establish himself as a
figure of national reconciliation _ and advance his longer-term
presidential ambitions _ Chernomyrdin would like to be approved
overwhelming by Parliament and on the first vote.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that he is ready to trade government posts for
parliamentary votes. President Boris Yeltsin has given Chernomyrdin
enormous latitude in forming his government. As the newspaper
Izvestia put in a headline early this week, ``Yeltsin Yields
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a matter of jobs or confirmation votes. The
Communist opposition has made it plain that they are also looking
for more left-leaning economic policies. As Gennady Seleznyov, a
Communist who is the speaker of Parliament, put it, ``if
Chernomyrdin recognizes our anti-crisis program and decides to
implement it, his appointment will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Chernomyrdin's allies have
flirted with the idea of coalition rule. During the 1996
presidential election campaign, some of Yeltsin's leading financial
backers became so fearful that the Communists might win that they
issued an open letter calling for an accommodation between the
Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who helped mastermind
Chernomyrdin's return to power, was among the group.
</P>
<P>
   But extricating Russia from its current crisis _ or at least
limiting the damage _ will also require decisions that irritate the
Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, Russia must control the money supply to
fight inflation, husband the government's dwindling resources by
limiting subsidies to failing banks, and reassure foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chernomyrdin has straddled the fence. He has talked
about continuing the march toward a free market. But he has also
echoed some of the Communists' favorite slogans.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for instance, that he would change ``industrial policy,
because by purely monetarist measures, we will not pull Russia out
of the crisis.'' That was a sop toward the Communist demands that
the Kremlin print more money and use government credits to prop up
ailing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Chernomyrdin was trying to stroke the Communists, he
rushed off to the Crimea for a meeting with Michel Camdessus, the
managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has
given Russia a small part of the $17 billion rescue bailout that
was negotiated in July, and Chernomyrdin wants to make sure that
the money keeps flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was not accompanied by a Communist deputy. He was
joined by Boris Fyodorov, the blunt-spoken economic aide who also
serves as the nation's chief tax collector. Fyodorov is a staunch
advocate of the free market and has told associates that if he were
a U.S. citizen, he would be a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor average Russians will know exactly where
Chernomyrdin stands until he begins to make tough decisions on
collecting taxes, cutting the budget deficit and saving the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the appointments to the Chernomyrdin team will
give some indication where he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to take advantage of Chernomyrdin's willingness to
compromise, the Communists have demanded at least 10 of the top
posts, including those involved in overseeing finance and industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the industrial barons who backed Chernomyrdin have their eye
on these jobs as well. Pyotr Aven, the head of Alpha Bank, is said
to be interested in running the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   And this equation does not take into account Chernomyrdin's own
party, Our Home is Russia, which believes that it should dominate
the upper rungs of power and is the second biggest party in
Parliament after the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a cadre of experienced government aides like
Fyodorov. Some of them are close to Chernomyrdin, who has stressed
the value of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sergei Kiriyenko was dismissed as prime minister this
week, the Yeltsin government was on a collision course with the
Communists in Parliament. Forming an alliance might seem a safer
course to Chernomyrdin, but coalition politics also has its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up Russia's addled political scene, Izvestia noted that
Chernomyrdin's attempts to negotiate were encouraging some members
of the leftist opposition to harden their demands. ``The game
between the leftist opposition with the prime minister has become
dangerous for the country,'' it said.

BIG 12 REAPS LUCRATIVE DEAL ON FOX CABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big 12 Conference agreed yesterday to a lucrative
renegotiation and extension of its contract with Fox Sports Net for
football cable telecasts through the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Big 12 and Fox Net agreed to a five-year deal worth
$42.5 million. The new deal calls for the next seven years to be
worth $129.2 million; the revised total rights fees over the
contract's 10-year length will be $156.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this indicates stability,'' said Kansas chancellor
Robert Hemenway, the Big 12's chief executive officer. ``I think
this is a good indicator of the health and the future of the
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with its contracts with Fox Net and ABC, the Big 12
will earn nearly $32 million per year in television rights fees.
Barry Frank, the conference's television negotiator, said that puts
it on a par with the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences in
television revenue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Frank said that talks with ABC Sports to renegotiate
that deal have broken off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be a change in that contract until it
expires,'' Frank said. ``I wouldn't call it ominous. It was simply
a matter of not being able to agree on numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12's deal with ABC runs through 2003 and at about $16
million per year. Part of the discussions involved ABC's desire to
have the Big 12's cable rights move from Fox to ESPN, the network's
corporate brother.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, though, because its initial contract was due to expire in
2000, had more urgency in its desire for a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fox deal in no way prevents us from going forward, but
there's no real urgency right now,'' ABC Sports spokesman Mark
Mandel said. ``We have a long-term commitment with the Big 12. I
would call this a pause in the normal ebb and flow of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2003, the Fox Net contract will allow the Big 12 to
renegotiate the Fox deal. Frank said that the ABC contract will end
at the same time is a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to football, the new Fox contract calls for cable
telecasts of 18 women's basketball games in addition to telecasts
of regular-season and championship events in conference Olympic
sports.

EMBARRASSED, ANGRY, FORGIVING ... WOMEN SPEAK OUT ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Deletes phrase after `intern' in 4th graf `who...dress?')  (See also CLINTON-SPEECH) 
(JT) 
 By JANNY SCOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something startling about the vocabulary that women who
have supported President Clinton now use in conversations about
him: phrases like skirt chaser and laughingstock, nouns like idiot
and jerk, adjectives like feckless, sleazy, self-indulgent, gross.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally striking that so many of the same women want
Clinton to remain in office. They say he has been a friend to
women. Even now, they could imagine voting for him again, if he
were able to run.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews in which women across the country were
asked how they felt about Clinton in light of the details of his
sexual entanglement with Monica Lewinsky, many struggled to
reconcile the person they had believed he was with the disturbing
details of what they now know he did.
</P>
<P>
   That is, how to reconcile the man who appointed Ruth Bader
Ginsburg to the United States Supreme Court and named the first
female attorney general and secretary of state with the man who was
caught philandering in the White House with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   The reconciliation is not coming easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised by how profoundly this has shaken me,''
said Nell Minow, a shareholder activist and mother of two from
McLean, Va. ``On behalf of the 24-year-old girl that I used to be
and the 46-year-old wife that I am now, I feel very shaken and
betrayed on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes soap opera broadcast live from Washington has
touched deep-rooted feelings not only about Clinton but about a set
of issues many women know well _ the marital infidelity of
middle-aged men, the degree of responsibility of younger women, the
appropriate reaction of a wife.
</P>
<P>
   It has become what Ms. Minow called ``one of the rare,
Rorschach-test moments that come along that really define a lot of
inner conflicts'' _ just as the O.J. Simpson case seemed to define
where people stood on race issues and the Anita Hill case did on
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, women seemed simultaneously to reveal feelings
about politics and marriage, about wayward presidents and husbands:
They were appalled, they were embarrassed, they wished they did not
know; they wanted him to stay, they wanted him out; they were
disappointed: How could he be so stupid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's gross,'' said Anne Bernays, a 67-year-old
novelist in Cambridge, Mass. ``And sleazy and self-indulgent and
risky, above all risky,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Many had little sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky. They called her a
groupie, silly and star-struck, in way over her head. Others saw
her as a victim. As for Hillary Rodham Clinton, some admired her
outward composure over the past two weeks, while a few wished she
would just get mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respected Hillary enormously _ up until yesterday,''
said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, an author and a founding editor of Ms.
magazine, the day after the Clinton family departed on vacation,
holding hands. ``It was the hand holding, the `We love each other.'
'' Ms. Pogrebin, 59, said she wished Mrs. Clinton would get angry.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the women interviewed had voted for Clinton in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his first presidential campaign, women have strongly
supported Clinton. In the 1996 election, the gender gap among
Clinton voters was 11 points. In public opinion polls, women have
consistently given Clinton slightly higher job approval ratings
than have men.
</P>
<P>
   But in a televised address on Aug. 17, he admitted for the first
time that he had had an inappropriate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Testifying in the grand jury investigation of the matter
earlier that day, he acknowledged that they had had ``inappropriate
intimate physical contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, however, is said to have described the
relationship differently in her own grand jury testimony, several
sexual encounters in a private study down a short hallway from the
Oval Office. She is said to have testified that Clinton also
caressed her breasts and genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was sexual contact between a married president
and a subordinate not much older than his daughter. To many women,
terms like ``romance'' do not quite fit. Some described Clinton's
behavior as sadly pathological; others used terms like ``tawdry''
and ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there no greater expression of power?'' asked Catharine
Stimpson, dean of the graduate school of arts and science at New
York University, reflecting on Clinton's arrangement with Ms.
Lewinsky. ``Is that not aristocratic? It's like eating without ever
doing the cooking or the shopping.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many women said they were not surprised. They had suspected as
much since the story first broke. And, as many Americans have said
all along, they said they consider the matter none of their
business and wish it would go away.
</P>
<P>
   Some said sex should not be used to measure morality or
immorality; nor should lying about sex, which they take to be
commonplace. They said they judge their presidents by other
standards, and, by those standards, Clinton had measured up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kind of tacky behavior,'' said Ms. Bernays. ``Also,
I think it's _ I love this word _ feckless. That he obliged loyal
people like Betty Currie to have to defend themselves and pay
enormous lawyers' bills, just because he can't keep his pants
zipped _ that's feckless.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Bogin Cohen, 61, a volunteer from Boston, said she had
figured all along that Clinton was a man of ``unrestrained
appetites and poor judgment.'' She said she had voted for him
anyway, believing he was better than the alternatives, and that she
could imagine doing so again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of things are gray in life,'' Ms. Cohen said. ``I think
his actions are deplorable and I don't really forgive him and I
think he did damage to the presidency. But I wouldn't not vote for
him if I thought he were the best person for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were stunned to find themselves so upset. For years, they
had given Clinton the benefit of the doubt. They had done their
best to overlook the unsettling details leaking out over the last
seven months. But finally, the details had become impossible to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minow, who recalled licking envelopes and distributing
flyers for Clinton, said she felt betrayed on behalf of the young
woman in her first job who she once was. Recalling the
vulnerability of that position, she said she was appalled by anyone
who might exploit a woman at that point in her life.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also felt betrayed as a wife whenever any
``middle-aged man opts for the smooth skin and the adoring gaze.''
Finally, as a former Clinton volunteer, she said she felt betrayed
``that he would risk everything I thought we both cared about for
something so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I don't know what would upset me more: if he cared
about her or if he didn't. I assume he didn't. This is not the
Wallis Simpson of America. It seems like such a tawdry,
exploitative, stupid relationship. And it's hard to reconcile that
with Mister-I-Feel-Your-Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Lewinsky, Joan Smith, 50, who owns a hair salon in
Middletown, Conn., dismissed her as an opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Daniloff, a 35-year-old university public relations
executive in Cambridge, Mass., said she figured Ms. Lewinsky had
embarked upon the relationship willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a child at all,'' said Susan Becker, a former
costume designer who is now a producer in Los Angeles. ``It's not
like `I had no idea this man was married!' Let's be honest. It
would seem that she had an agenda. So I don't really have any
sympathies in that department.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, it was almost immaterial whether she was a consenting
adult, because she was in a situation in which consent was
complicated by the extreme imbalance of power between the people
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset, I thought, `Hey, 21, that's plenty old enough
to consent,''' said Miriam Horn, 40, a writer in Manhattan who is
working a book on Mrs. Clinton's Wellesley College classmates.
``Thinking back to my own 21-year-old-ness, I guess that feeling
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think he's completely responsible, almost no
matter what she did,'' she said. ``The gap is so unfathomable
between a 21-year-old intern and a man more than twice her age who
is not only the president but a man of famous charisma. I think his
obligation to exercise restraint is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   There were similarly split feelings about Mrs. Clinton's
handling of the matter, including the sentiments expressed in a
statement after Clinton's speech, in which a spokeswoman stated
that Mrs. Clinton loved and forgave him, was committed to their
marriage and was relying on her religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Hillary,'' said Ms. Cohen of Boston, thinking back on the
day of Clinton's televised admission. ``I mean, yes, he got her to
the White House. But what a terrible day she had. And even if she
knew it _ and I'm sure she knew it _ she has to eat crow in public
because of this jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pogrebin, who said she has raised money and campaigned for
Clinton since 1991, said she now wants him to resign. ``He has lost
his political usefulness,'' she said. But most of the women
interviewed said they still wanted him as president, despite
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, in this reactionary climate, Clinton passes for something
like a bulwark for certain civil liberties and principles that
women believe in,'' said Ann Douglas, an English professor at
Columbia University. To continue to support him, even now, is
completely defensible, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that means I'm a grown-up,'' said Douglas, who said
she voted for the Green Party candidate in the last presidential
election. ``Politics are interest politics. I have my interests. I
will think twice about demolishing someone who has worked,
comparatively speaking, to protect the things I care about.''

TCU DEFENSIVE END IS A MORE MATURE MENACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU defensive end Aaron Schobel isn't into
how he's perceived.
</P>
<P>
   Which means being first in drills is not his concern. And it is
not uncommon to see the 6-foot-4, 240-pound sophomore sulk and
become irritated with practicing.
</P>
<P>
   These are not consistent characteristics for the Horned Frogs'
most accomplished and punishing player on the defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I come off that way just to take the pressure
off of myself,'' Schobel said. ``Sometimes I want people to think
I'm lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Schobel may have put on too convincing an act for the new
coaching staff when spring practice opened in March. But as the
spring session went on, Schobel began to show flashes of his
redshirt freshman campaign, when he made 69 tackles, including
seven quarterback sacks and a team-best eight stops for negative
(minus-61) yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Schobel often served as a defensive menace during the spring as
first-year coach Dennis Franchione and his assistants attempted to
install the new offense. And it has carried over into fall camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's developed a maturity and understands he must make
a commitment to the game and the preparation for it in order to be
as good as he wants to be,'' TCU defensive line coach Stan Eggen
said. ``What's making him a better football player is he is
starting to understand that just gliding along will not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of Schobel's greatest obstacles has been his
superior athletic ability. Blessed with exceptional quickness and
agility and an understanding of how the game is played, the former
Columbus High School standout has always seemed to shine without
much effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron is just a football player, and that's the highest
compliment to give somebody,'' Franchione said. ``He knows how to
play the game, and he's got great instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably relies on his instincts maybe too much, but they
are good to him, and he can get by on them sometimes. The Lord has
given him something to play the game with that not everybody has.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding that more would be required of him, Schobel made a
commitment during the off-season strength and conditioning program.
He has returned stronger, perhaps in the best condition of his
life, for his second season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I was satisfied with what I was able to
accomplish last season,'' said Schobel, whose brother Matt, a
quarterback, transferred to TCU this summer from Texas A&AMP;M. ``But
if I were to have a similar season this year, then I would
definitely be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it has been important for me to work hard and to
push myself even when maybe I'm not into it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Eggen stops short of deeming Schobel the primary
play-maker up front this season, he does recognize the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he continues to improve as he has this fall, then I believe
he is certainly a person that opposing teams need to be concerned
with,'' Eggen said. ``But a lot is going to depend on Aaron.''

3 SUSPECTS HELD IN CAPE TOWN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Police investigating Tuesday's bombing
of a Planet Hollywood restaurant here stopped an Air Egypt plane on
the tarmac as it was to take off for Cairo on Thursday and detained
three people, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman was careful to say that the three _ a man and two
women _ were ``not our No. 1 suspects or anything'' and that they
were not charged but were simply being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing is being investigated by the FBI for any link to the
bombings earlier this month of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, attacks the United States has accused a Saudi exile,
Osama bin Laden, of backing.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives here received an anonymous tip saying that the three,
all South African Muslims, were involved in the Plant Hollywood
bombing, which killed one person and wounded 26, said the police
spokesman, Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to the airport, found what he called ``discrepancies
in their travel documents,'' removed the trio from the plane and
detained them, initially under the Aliens Control Act.
Fingerprints, tests for traces of gunpowder and other forensics may
follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, an
anti-crime group led by conservative Muslim clerics, reacted
angrily to the arrests, saying the man held was a member of the
group and on a pilgrimage to Mecca with his wife and a family
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disgusted with the unfair manner in which he's been
treated,'' the group's spokeswoman, Abeeda Roberts, said. ``What
about his privacy? What about the safety of his family?''
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly upset, she said, that the national
television network had shown the three suspects' faces and used
their names. Her organization and the police have refused to
release the names.
</P>
<P>
   A legal adviser to anti-crime group, Cassiem Parker, accused
police of ``singling out Muslims leaving the country'' in order to
announce that they had solved the crime quickly. He said police
would not tell him where the three were being held and were
questioning them without lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prominent Muslims repeatedly mention the Oklahoma
City bombing, which was initially assumed to be the work of Islamic
terrorists but turned out to be carried out by far-right Americans.
Police here say they do not want to be similarly embarrassed, and
are scrupulously avoiding saying whom they suspect in the Planet
Hollywood attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Parker accused the South African police of
incompetence and of ``adding to Islamophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts insisted that FBI agents have been torturing members
of her anti-crime group in South African jails in an effort to
obtain information about the embassy bombings. No U.S. official was
available Thursday night for comment on the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Something like ``Islamophobia'' is clearly at work in the Cape
Town area, where as many as 400,000 Muslims live. Muslim callers to
radio stations have described being hounded off buses by hostile
remarks and fearing that their children will be beaten up at
school. And Muslims of all political stripes fear being branded in
the public eye as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, a local paper, quoting anonymous
sources, initially reported that security cameras inside the
restaurant had taped a prime suspect, a ``Morrocan-looking man who
was from Zimbabwe but now lives in the Cape area.'' It was never
explained how the cameras picked up the man's life history.
</P>
<P>
   Later, police issued a statement seeking to quash the story,
saying security cameras had shown a person ``behaving in a highly
suspicious manner'' but that restaurant employees who saw the tape
later said it was more than a month old.
</P>
<P>
   There are more tapes, a police spokesman said, but it is not
known whether the Planet Hollywood cameras were taping on the night
of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Parliament held a debate over the bombing.
The National Party, which ruled during the apartheid era, and the
Freedom Front, which represents conservative Afrikaners, accused
the government of being soft on crime and called for the return of
the death penalty. The government's minister for safety and
security replied that ``responding in panic or irresponsibility
will be playing into the hands of the terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, FBI bomb experts looked over the site of the
explosion with their South African counterparts but declined to
speak to reporters. In the afternoon, Mandela paid a brief surprise
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims Against Global Oppression, a group originally blamed for
the blast by an anonymous caller, held a news conference Thursday
to denounce the bombing as a cowardly act and convey its
condolences to the wounded. The group's leaders said the bombing
and phone call were probably an attempt to malign them or to spread
religious tension.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would still hold a march on the U.S.
Consulate in Cape Town on Saturday that they had announced a day
before the restaurant blast. They handed out leaflets bearing the
headline ``Death to America'' that described the U.S.
cruise-missile attacks on the Sudan and Afghanistan as acts of
terrorism.

A NOMADIC KELLY LEAVES HAPPY TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Left-hander Greg Cadaret, the Rangers' most
recent acquisition, sauntered through the clubhouse upon his
arrival at The Ballpark in Arlington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret, who that afternoon joined his eighth major-league
organization since first appearing with the 1987 Oakland Athletics,
recognized another well-traveled face from across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always around,'' teased the Panamanian with the
baritone voice and his right hand extended. ``Are you following
me?''
</P>
<P>
   The rich, deep voice belonged to Roberto Kelly, a 33-year-old
reserve outfielder whose awareness for three-digit sequences
extends beyond his recognition of a batting average.
</P>
<P>
   It encompasses area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's travelogue includes stops in eight area codes over the
past seven seasons despite a career batting average of .290 and a
productive .323 this season for the Rangers and manager Johnny
Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Explain that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Kelly responded. ``I wish I had an
answer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one does.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin compared Kelly's movement to that of
third baseman Todd Zeile, whom the Rangers acquired July 31 from
the Florida Marlins for two minor-league players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not bad guys,'' Melvin said. ``Clubs want them more
than they don't want them. They're desirable players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners, Kelly's employers the previous season,
wished for his return after the outfielder hit .298 during
September and .308 during their best-of-five, divisional playoff
series against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but positive things to say about the guy,''
said Mariners manager Lou Piniella, who dismissed the notion
Kelly's travels suggest a clubhouse problem. ``He played well for
us. It was a matter of economics. We wanted to sign him, but his
agent was asking for more than we could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella told Oates a similar story, as did the Minnesota Twins'
Tom Kelly, another of the outfielder's previous managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou told me that they did not want to get rid of him. They
liked him. That's all he had to say,'' Oates recalled. ``I went to
Tom Kelly, and he said the same thing. That got me excited.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that the Atlanta Braves also desired Kelly,
but Melvin signed the outfielder to a two-year contract in December
worth a guaranteed $3.85 million. It proved to be Melvin's
successful attempt in strengthening the Rangers' bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never looked at it as a team getting rid of me,'' said
Kelly, who enters today's doubleheader against the Chicago White
Sox with 12 home runs and 34 runs batted in despite only 201
at-bats. ``I've always looked at it as another team wanting me.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of area codes demonstrate that.
</P>
<P>
   718: American League All-Star for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   513: National League All-Star for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   404: Acquired by the Braves from the Reds for a 1994 pennant
race that never materialized because of a players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   514: Traded by the Braves (with outfielder Tony Tarasco and
pitcher Esteban Yan) to the Expos for center fielder Marquis
Grissom, one of three All-Star outfielders _ the others being Paul
O'Neill and Henry Rodriguez _ involved in trades for Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   213: Hit .364 (4-for-11) for the Dodgers during their 1995
best-of-five, divisional playoff series against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   612: Hit an American League-best .406 against left-handers for
the Twins in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   206: Hit .298 during September and .308 during the Mariners'
1997 best-of-five, divisional playoff series against the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kelly calls the 817 area code home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I came here that I was going to be the fourth
outfielder,'' he said. ``I'm happy I've been able to fulfill that
role. You know what? We could (complain) and moan about not
playing, but where would that get us?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 22 years old anymore, so I wanted to go to a team that
had a chance to play in the postseason. I'm happy to be here, and
I'm satisfied with the job I'm doing. I don't know how much longer
I'll be doing this. I've been to the playoffs. I want to go to the
World Series and win it.''

RICKY II THE ONE FOR TEXAS TECH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other Ricky Williams is quietly making a name for himself.
</P>
<P>
   And if for the moment he is but an afterthought to a college
football public more familiar with the Heisman Trophy candidate of
the same name at the University of Texas, so be it. This, says the
Texas Tech sophomore tailback from Duncanville, is far from being a
personal problem.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison ``is going to happen, but it's a great situation
for me,'' said Williams, who last season broke the school's
freshman rushing record set by Red Raiders career leader Byron
Hanspard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Williams at Texas is a great running back who is going
to get the publicity because of the success he's had. I keep
telling myself that my time will come and I have to step up, then
I'll get the same kind of publicity. I've worked hard. I'm
confident. It's just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams emerged from a pack of tailback candidates a year ago
to start the season opener against Tennessee, replacing Hanspard,
who left a year early for the NFL. By season's end, Williams had
rushed for 894 yards on 201 carries (4.4-yard average). Included
was a season-high, 179-yard performance against Kansas and a
131-yard game against the Longhorns, in which the more famous Ricky
Williams was held to 80 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's Williams also caught 10 passes for 130 yards and averaged
19.3 yards on 11 kickoff returns while making the Big 12
commissioner's academic honor roll for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky did way better early than we thought he would,'' coach
Spike Dykes admitted. ``He came from a really good high school
program, and he had the skills and a work ethic that a lot of guys
don't have at that age. But I still thought that because of his
(lack of) size, it would take him a while. He started out as the
No. 6 tailback. Then we play Tennessee, and he's in the starting
lineup. ''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says he has grown an inch and a half to 5-foot-9. He
has gained 14 pounds to 192, yet can still run the 40 in the
4.4-second range. Bigger, stronger and more confident, Williams is
now counted on as a leader of a rebuilt Tech offense that features
new faces at quarterback, center and both guards. Yet that unit may
still be a strength of a team that enters next week's opening game
against UT-El Paso thinking of reaching a major bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal right now is to try and beat UTEP,'' Williams
said cautiously, then warming to the subject. ``But we want to
really put in a big effort to get a roll going in our first five
games (UTEP, North Texas, Fresno State, Iowa State, Baylor) and
then see what happens from there.''
</P>
<P>
   His impressive rookie season hasn't taken the edge off Williams'
drive, said veteran Tech running backs coach Jack Tayrien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is one of those kids who has a lot of football savvy,
but he busts his tail working hard,'' Tayrien said. ``He's not very
big, but he's durable. He was definitely a surprise last year, but
(he) just came in and from the start didn't make many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous quickness and great vision. He's as good as
anybody I've ever coached at picking up blitzes (on pass
protection). And when he's not carrying the ball, he does a great
job faking, which is very important because he's the focus of our
play-action passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes has seen the other side of Williams' potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky runs with a great deal of thrust,'' Dykes said, ``but
changing direction has never been his long suit. The other day in
practice, though, I saw him make a cut he couldn't have even
thought about making a year ago. He's starting to get pretty good
at that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Williams is far from satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season wasn't bad,'' he said. ``But looking back, I can
see where I need to improve at a lot of things. I want to gain more
yards, score more touchdowns. I want to try and make everything
perfect.''

INVESTIGATION OVER, BUT WHAT'S UP WITH MAVS' USSERY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse my confusion, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mavericks, as an organization, are unable to market
basketball success, they have done a good job of bringing a focus
to the next best thing:
</P>
<P>
   attempting to sell family entertainment instead of W's.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, why is Terdema Ussery still holding a job? And his
job starts right at the top of the organization. President and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The story broke six weeks ago that the Mavericks had conducted
an in-house investigation of Ussery involving multiple counts of
sexual misconduct within the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Mavericks attorney Tom Luce, upon request, issued a
statement, saying, ``the matter has been completed. The
organization has addressed the situation. Terdema Ussery is
president of the team, and will continue his efforts to build a
championship organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, Ussery may be innocent, and can be assumed as such
until proved otherwise. But the stonewalling of this situation,
starting with owner Ross Perot Jr., had led to an assumption of
guilt, at least to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   If guilty, Ussery should have been fired by Perot.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, if Ussery has been found innocent, then where
is the public announcement? This man's reputation has been
seriously damaged, and he has also been left dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Until yesterday, the only answer in six weeks, came from Luce.
Then everyone went silent.
</P>
<P>
   Did Junior assume we all just forgot? Or that this dirt could be
swept under Roy Tarpley's old locker?
</P>
<P>
   Perot is admittedly naive about the business end of professional
sports, but he's certainly not that clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, even the Cowboys' organization was using the Ussery case
while trying to media-manage that neck-slashing in the
training-camp dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous front-office voices for the Cowboys offered an
admittedly valid opinion that the media weren't hammering the
Mavericks over the Ussery in-house investigation. So why then, they
asked, couldn't the Cowboys ``no comment'' their way through
Neckgate on the premise it was being handled ``internally''?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Cowboys later received support from both
Judge Manny Alvarez and the NFL league office that there was no
criminal intent with the incident or hush money payoff involved.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us can decide independently if that's believable, but
you did notice, I'm sure, how the incident suddenly faded from the
media's cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Ussery case has become media dormant is due
to the NBA's lockout and lockdown on news. Nothing about the NBA is
newsworthy at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Once, however, the lockout ends, and a new NBA season
approaches, the sexual misconduct investigation involving Ussery
will surface again, and again, and ...
</P>
<P>
   So was he cleared of the charges, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Ussery, surely, has that answer by now. But he was not saying
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has addressed it, and I will not elaborate beyond
that,'' Ussery said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Luce is telling us it's business as usual at 777 Sports
St. But there has still been no answer on Ussery's guilt or
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery may be forced to play the corporate game, meaning silence
unless instructed by lawyers to speak. But when your professional
reputation goes on the line, don't you have to publicly defend
yourself, regardless? Provided, of course, there is innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment, however, centers on Perot, who most
of us in the local media have regarded as a man of honor. But at
the moment, Junior comes across as weak and wobbly. Is Perot
allowing a guilty man to continue to be the boss of his basketball
workplace, or is he allowing the innocent to dangle in a helpless
state?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, could Perot be preparing to sell the Mavericks,
therefore making the decision on Ussery the problem of the next
owner?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks still has plenty of stall space in his sports
franchise barn. Hicks would be more than happy to move the
Mavericks in with the Rangers and Stars. The more the better for
Hicks, at least from a sports TV network standpoint, which is Hicks
ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   And knowing Don Carter, there is no way he could be pleased
about even a hint of a team executive being involved in a sexual
misconduct scandal. Particularly one involving ``multiple'' team
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Would Carter buy back the Mavericks? Yes. Like right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks haven't had basketball appeal in a long while. But
now there's also decay upstairs. If Ussery is innocent, tell us.
Otherwise, Junior Perot should begin the housecleaning by removing
himself.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock market investors around the world rushed the
exits Thursday. The depth of the economic problems in Russia and
Asia proved too unfathomable for investors, who scoured the
horizons for a haven.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 4.19 percent, or 357.36 points, to close at 8165.99.
The Nasdaq fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow average now 12.5 percent below its July 17 high of
9337.97, investors are well into what Wall Street calls a
correction. Bear market territory _ defined as a stock price
decline of 15 percent to 20 percent _ is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Investors struggled to absorb the full impact of Russia's
economic woes _ its central bank has stopped supporting the ruble
and has defaulted on its ruble-denominated debt. Institutions that
had bought the country's debt saw the value of their holdings fall
to around 10 percent of its worth just last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear that the economic unraveling in Russia could spread
to the emerging market countries of Latin America acted as the
greatest depressant on stocks worldwide. Indeed, investors
everywhere wondered which economy would be the next to crumple.
</P>
<P>
   Major markets fell, with the exception of Hong Kong. In Europe,
key indexes fell 3 percent to 6 percent, with the Dax in Germany
dropping 4.5 percent. Latin America's markets were punished even
more, with Mexico's main index falling 6 percent and Brazil's
nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment over Japan's inability to repair its broken-down
economy drove the Nikkei 225 index down 3.04 percent long before
trading began in the United States. Policy paralysis seems to have
overtaken Japanese politicians, who appear unwilling to take steps
to solve their country's well-documented economic and banking
problems. The Nikkei has fallen 16.5 percent this year from its
March high.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market opened in the United States, traders and
money managers reported a flood of early selling, selling that
continued in waves all day. Even though stocks tried to rally
several times, few, if any, buyers were willing to pick through the
rubble for bargains. The market closed at its low, a sign of
overwhelming market weakness and a sign of caution for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of big international banks, which were down an average of
6.6 percent, were among the hardest hit on fears of Russia-related
losses. But rampant selling ravaged even the most favored stocks,
such as Coca-Cola, General Electric and Microsoft, as well as
Internet darlings Excite Inc. and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering of the healthiest companies can be attributed in
part to selling by investors who had to raise cash because of
losses on their emerging market investments. When an investor has
to cough up cash because he has borrowed heavily to make foreign
investments that are cratering, he sells whatever he can. Often
that means the biggest, most liquid investment. Or the investment
that still shows a profit.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vicious circle, said William Dudley, an economist at
Goldman, Sachs in New York. ``People are becoming increasingly risk
averse, leading to lower equity prices, increasing pressure on
emerging market economies. Absent right now is any mechanism to
break that dynamic up.'' As a result, Dudley suggests that
investors brace for more market declines.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news started early. At 9:46 a.m., shares in the Republic
New York Corporation, the parent of Republic National Bank of New
York, were halted from trading. Minutes later, the bank announced
it would take a $110 million charge in the third quarter for losses
in Russian government bonds. The loss would virtually eliminate
earnings for the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it became clear that the ultimate impact of the
Russian disaster was still unknown. If Republic Bank, known for its
strong balance sheet and conservative lending practices, was hurt
by Russia, what would happen to more aggressive lenders?
</P>
<P>
   With that announcement, Republic Bank became the first domestic
bank to enumerate its Russian losses. Market historians noted that
Republic was also the first domestic bank, back in the mid-1980s,
to reveal the extent of its exposure to lesser-developed country
debt that later hammered Citicorp and many other American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in financial stocks Thursday found themselves in a
nightmarish version of the child's game of hot potato. Exposure to
Russia's ruble devaluation and effective default on its debt is
only starting to be defined. And since many of the losses will be
taken by investors who bought or sold derivative securities, where
the parties who took the other side of a given trade are not
immediately identifiable, it could be weeks before it is known who
is on the hook for what may be $100 billion in losses. In the
meantime, investors ask: Losses, losses, who's got the losses?
</P>
<P>
   Some investors wondered why a country as economically
inconsequential as Russia should play such a big role in world
market turmoil. Yes, Russia wields nuclear firepower, but it
accounts for just 1 percent of the world's trade, roughly
equivalent to that of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted, though, that what happened in Russia could very
well replay in the emerging markets of Latin America. When
investors see their portfolios lose 90 percent of their value, as
those holding Russian debt have, two things happen. Assets in other
emerging markets need to fall in price to reflect the new economic
reality. And, as those assets are repriced, investors and lenders
withdraw from the markets, cutting off companies' access to capital
and making financing more expensive for governments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's default also made it painfully obvious that the
International Monetary Fund is no longer ready or able to bail out
countries in economic despair. Bailouts in Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand had lulled investors into believing that the IMF was
effectively a guarantor of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   So what investors are facing now is the very thing Wall Street
fears the most: the unknown. The devil we know, an imploding Russia
in this case, is bad enough. The devil we don't know, what other
economic disasters lie ahead, most particularly in Latin America,
is considerably worse.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all eyes are on Latin America. That's because a crisis
in these nations would strike a severe blow to both American
investors and corporations. Some 25 percent of Brazil's $300
billion in domestic debt, for example, is held by foreign
investors. More important, around 20 percent of United States
exports go to Latin America.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, the stock market carnage is worse
than it first appears. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette reported
Thursday that the average stock was down 38 percent from its high.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager said that the selling was overdone and the
result of investors buying stocks only because they are going up.
``People have been investing by the direction of earnings and not
looking at value,'' said David Eidelman, at Eidelman, Finger,
Harris &AMP; Co. in St. Louis. ``If earnings are going higher, they
buy. But when they start to see earnings come down, they look at
the direction not the value. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, these
investors, so-called momentum players, know the price of everything
and the value of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the slide Thursday, brokerage firms asked
investors who had borrowed to buy stocks to prop up their depleted
portfolios with more cash, known as margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   More than one professional trader said that Thursday's action in
United States stocks was reminiscent of the beginning of the end of
the great bull market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. These
traders recalled that the 1973 bear market, which removed 45
percent from the Dow Jones industrial average, did not begin in
earnest until the Nifty Fifty stocks _ names like Polaroid, Avon
and IBM crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, approximately 15 stocks _ including Dell
Computer, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems _ had held up while
the rest of the United States market had fallen. Thursday, even
these shares fell hard.

 &HT;    Close but not too close to Clinton
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, WASH. _ House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt said
Thursday he still intends to appear with President Clinton at a
series of Democrat fund-raisers this fall, despite his recent
criticism of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing Clinton's role as the Democrats' money-raiser,
Gephardt said he and Clinton will be at events in New York, Boston,
Los Angeles and St. Louis, Gephardt's hometown, in September and
October.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope to raise $18 million for the November elections,
of which $6 million would go to candidates for the House. ``That's
what we think we need to be competitive,'' Gephardt said during a
day of campaign stops with candidates in Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he has yet to talk to Clinton since Gephardt
returned from a family vacation in France this week. Earlier in the
week, he said Clinton's conduct was ``reprehensible'' and he could
not rule out the possibility of impeachment if the facts warrant
such action.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's comments were widely interpreted as a signal to House
Democrats and Democratic candidates that they need not defend
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to gain 11 seats in the House to regain the
majority they lost in 1994. If that happens, Gephardt almost
certainly would replace Newt Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Democrat walked a fine line Thursday at events in
Portland, Vancouver, Olympia and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He took pains to dispel the notion that he is distancing himself
from the president, even as candidate after candidate said they
were not anxious for Clinton to campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, for example, Democrat David Wu said he is ``very,
very happy'' with the lineup of Democrats who are scheduled to
visit Oregon, a list that does not include Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he needs to assure the public that Democrats will
deal objectively with the report independent counsel Kenneth Starr
is expected to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this some effort to do anything other than be
straightforward, honest and realistic about where we are, what
needs to be done and how I hope this would proceed,'' Gephardt
said. ``If this is a partisan street fight, then we've let the
American people down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt, essentially agreeing with comments Gingrich made
this week, said it was extremely unlikely that Congress would hold
hearings before the elections. ``I don't even know that there's
going to be a report'' before then, Gephardt said. ``I hope there
isn't.''

 &HT;    Flood's aftermath
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi and Ralph Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the moment, Del Rio's heartbreak is getting
state and national attention. But perhaps the cruelest aspect of a
disaster is that the aftermath has such a long shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermath will be a constant companion to the residents of the
Val Verde County seat long after the television crews and reporters
are gone. What will be left is the drudgery of cleaning up, and
picking up the pieces of daily life in the aftermath of a flood
that left 17 dead on both sides of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government can offer loans and grants to repair and
replace homes lost. Those left homeless will find temporary
shelter. But where do you go to replace the love and counsel of
those who drowned? There will be no lines to recover the very
personal treasures like photo albums lost to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The psychic and spiritual loss may not be fully felt until
later. Right now, the focus is on cleaning up the damage done to
the city of 34,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is an awesome physical task to rebuild and recover after a
disaster. Electricity, telephone and gas service have been
restored. And people are slowly being allowed back into the San
Felipe barrio to deal with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   There were 250 homes destroyed and another 300 damaged citywide,
according to Marta Sepeda, an assistant city attorney in Del Rio.
Water service has been restored, she said, but the water isn't yet
drinkable. Potable water is still a need.
</P>
<P>
   Those left homeless and with no other place to go remain at the
Del Rio Civic Center. There is a need for volunteers there, Sepeda
said. Eventually, there will be a need for dump trucks, cranes and
building materials.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Del Rio is getting help from neighboring counties
which are lending trucks and personnel. Law enforcement officers
from surrounding counties and towns are there to help keep order
and relieve Del Rio officers. The City of Austin sent firefighters,
a medic and an emergency room physician to lend assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Those assistance efforts are commendable, an example that people
have the heart and willingness to help a neighbor in distress.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texans know all too well what misery a flood can bring.
</P>
<P>
   How to help
</P>
<P>
   To make donations of cash to help victims of flooding call:
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross of Central Texas: 928-4271
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Chapter of the American Red Cross: (210)
224-5151. Donations can also be sent to 3642 E. Houston, San
Antonio, 78219.
</P>
<P>
   To make donations of food or clothing call:
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army: 416-0607. The Salvation Army can pick up
donations, or they can be dropped off at the Salvation Army at 4216
S. Congress Ave.

 &HT;    Classic race heats up in Tarheel State
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, N.C. -- Appearing at a fund-raiser here for Sen.
Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), fellow Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina set aside his plate of east Carolina barbecue and
cut straight to the punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now why won't sharks attack trial lawyers?'' Thurmond demanded
in an unsteady voice. ``Professional courtesy.'' The crowd in the
banquet room at the Best Western hooted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many trial lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?''
he continued. ``Three. One to change the bulb and two to sue him
for malpractice.'' Keith Whited, a local lawyer, winced. ``That
hurt,'' Whited said under his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about the trial lawyer that was hurt in an
accident?'' Thurmond pressed on to the crowd's delight. ``An
ambulance backed up suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 1998 North Carolina Senate campaign, featuring
perhaps the Senate's most vulnerable incumbent, most talked-about
challenger and plenty of third-rate lawyer jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The point of Thurmond's digs was not lost on the white,
middle-aged crowd in this heavily Republican area of the Tarheel
State. Faircloth's opponent in the Senate campaign is John Edwards,
a 45-year-old trial lawyer who has already spent $3.5 million to
win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Raleigh attorney is everything Faircloth, a wealthy hog
farmer who turned 70 this year, is not: youthful, telegenic and
charismatic. The combination has already made Edwards the darling
of the Washington media buzz circuit, which loves to anoint and
promote upstart challengers in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are enjoying a renaissance in North Carolina. In
1996, the party reclaimed two House seats after losing four in
1994, evening the House delegation to six Democrats and six
Republicans, and re-elected a popular Democratic governor, Jim Hunt
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards, who has never held political office, still faces an
uphill battle. He is running as a Washington outsider in a year
when voters elsewhere seem to be putting more value on experience.
And Edwards faces an incumbent, who despite his plain-spoken,
parochial manner, is a savvy tactician with deep roots in North
Carolina politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Faircloth beat the late Sen. Terry Sanford, a
much-loved former North Carolina governor and president of Duke
University, against long odds just a year after he switched parties
and remade himself from a conservative Democrat into a conservative
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Image is everything
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Faircloth has been remaking his image once
again, this time to appeal to the tens of thousands of new, mostly
moderate Republicans who have moved to take jobs in Charlotte and
North Carolina's booming Research Triangle, a high-tech center
located around Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Faircloth made
headlines attacking first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's financial
dealings in the Whitewater controversy, winning points with
conservatives but losing them among many women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth is happy to talk about the Clintons now _ off the
record. In public, he is smoothing his image among women voters by
highlighting his support of legislation that created a new, 40-cent
stamp that generates money for breast cancer research. Faircloth
signed as a co-sponsor of the bill, sponsored by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.), last year.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth also now is supporting a bipartisan health care
proposal to regulate health maintenance organizations after
opposing efforts to regulate health care in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   In his first term, Faircloth backed legislation to sharply
curtail the federal Clean Water Act, pushing changes that would
have exempted half the nation's wetlands from federal protections.
Now, he is promoting his opposition to oil drilling off North
Carolina's coast.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Faircloth, who ranks among the most conservative
Republicans in the Senate, is looking more like a Democrat, says
Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans are doing this,'' says Beyle. ``As they
get closer to the election, they suddenly have to be viewed as
Democrats and move away from more of their knee-jerk ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth shrinks at the suggestion he's swung left to help his
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a conservative, but certainly not to the
extent that I'm not very much aware of the fact that we have to
keep an open mind for advancements and opportunity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the closeness of the race _ the most recent polls put
Faircloth 9 points ahead of Edwards _ Faircloth notes that
``anybody who is the Democratic nominee, Saddam Hussein, will get
40 percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   `Up for grabs'
</P>
<P>
   Much like neighboring Georgia, North Carolina has become a
toss-up state for Republicans and Democrats, largely because of the
roughly 20 percent of the electorate who label themselves
independents.
</P>
<P>
   These voters tend to vote Republican, but don't necessarily
share the conservative ideology of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the
state's archconservative, says Ferrel Guillory at UNC's Center for
the Study of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in some ways up for grabs,'' says Guillory. ``They
may bring their Republicanism with them, but they don't know Lauch
Faircloth ... It's an interesting and dicey electorate for both
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth's Senate seat hasn't been held by an incumbent since
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, however, isn't ignoring his conservative base. In
what appears to be a pitch to white conservatives, the Republican
Senate campaign committee ran nearly $400,000 of ``issue ads''
touting Faircloth's role in stripping Washington Mayor Marion Barry
of his control over city finances.
</P>
<P>
   That record sits well with older voters such as Charles Hampton.
``He has the same philosophy we have,'' said Hampton, who attended
Faircloth's fund-raiser here. ``I like what he tried to do in the
district, make it more efficient instead of wasting money.''
</P>
<P>
   At his Burlington fund-raiser, Faircloth pledged never to raise
taxes and vowed to vote to override President Clinton's veto of
legislation banning certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition literature distributed at the event gave
Faircloth a 92 percent voting record. The score matched Faircloth
against a zero for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a lightning
rod for Southern conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a classic race between and a conservative, a working
man, a businessman, a man who has spent his life in business, and a
liberal, a man who announced that he was going to be a warrior for
unions and personal injury attorneys,'' Faircloth told the crowd of
200.
</P>
<P>
   Populist themes, lawyerly scenes
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, meanwhile, appears to have succeeded in energizing
Democratic voters around his populist campaign themes of more
federal support for education, enacting a patients bill of rights
and devoting budget surpluses to repay the Social Security trust
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Spending heavily on television, Edwards captured the Democratic
nomination against two rivals without a runoff _ even after
Faircloth called Edwards ``North Carolina's No. 1 personal injury
lawyer'' in an attack ad. ``He makes millions suing people,'' the
ad said.
</P>
<P>
   The mill worker's son from Robbins, N.C., is spending a lot of
his time putting a positive face on his vocation. Edwards tells
voters that he will be the ``fiercest, most passionate advocate''
they will have in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He has also refused to take any special interest money from
political action committees, another attempt to blunt attacks that
he is just another wealthy trial attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards most celebrated case was a claim he successfully pursued
on behalf of a young girl whose insides were sucked out by a faulty
swimming pool drain. He frequently compares voters to jurors and
delivers his stump speech in much the same way he would address the
jury box in one of his cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's going to fight for the regular people on the
street,'' says Joe Adams, an Asheville attorney who attended a
rally for the candidate in western North Carolina. ``He's just not
bought and paid for before he gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Edwards has proposed that he and
Faircloth pool their campaign money to purchase prime time
television and debate one another on the issues, forgoing
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth dismisses the proposal as a ``political ploy'' and a
``meaningless gesture,'' but Edwards says voters are tired of
politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of it is very simple, to at least move down the road
to replacing 30-second sound bites and negative attack ads with a
substantive, real discussion,'' Edwards says. ``What I'm saying is
let's step out and try to make North Carolina a shining example of
what it can be.''

 &HT;    Senate contests in South to produce heavy ad campaigns
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ With Labor Day and the unofficial beginning of the
fall campaigns just around the corner, U.S. Senate candidates from
around the South are preparing to unleash millions of dollars in
television advertising to grab voters' attention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Michael Coles' challenge to Republican incumbent
Paul Coverdell in Georgia, the South will feature some of the
hottest races in the country. Democrats are trying to recoup ground
lost during the last three election cycles, while Republicans want
to fatten their dominance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now control the Senate 55 to 45, but the majority is
less imposing than it might seem. Under Senate rules, 60 votes are
required to end debate and vote on bills, meaning an organized
minority can tie the chamber up in knots.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is leading the GOP Senate
election effort, wants to put his party closer to the magic
filibuster-proof number of 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have an excellent year,'' says McConnell, who
nonetheless doubts that Republicans can pick up five seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), who is leading the Democrat's effort,
says the party's agenda of putting more teachers in the classroom
will make Democrats competitive in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will have a clear alternative to what Republicans
are offering,'' Kerrey says.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a preview:
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas: Democrats lost a Senate seat in President Clinton's
home state in 1996, but this year have nominated a strong candidate
to succeed Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.).
</P>
<P>
   Blanche Lambert-Lincoln, a former congresswoman from the
Razorback State, is leading her GOP opponent by 20 points in the
most recent polls. Lincoln left Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate is state senator Fay Boozman, who is
less well known to voters. Most problematic for Boozman is that
voter surveys indicate that only 7 percent of the electorate is
undecided about the two candidates, leaving the Republican little
ground to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky: McConnell's home state features the other open Senate
contest in the South. Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) is retiring, and
two congressmen with established names are vying to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scotty Baesler, a former University of Kentucky basketball
star, won the Democratic nomination in a hard-fought campaign
against a wealthy businessman and the state's lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler faces Rep. Jim Bunning, a former major league pitcher
who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts rate the race a toss-up, but Bunning faced a much less
rigorous primary fight and has more money to spend in the general
election. In a signal of how important the contest is to McConnell,
the Kentucky Republican recently sent his Washington chief of
staff, Kyle Simmons, down to Kentucky to join the Bunning campaign.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina: Sen. Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.) has stayed a
Democrat since he was first elected to the Senate in 1966. In the
intervening years, however, the voters in South Carolina have
switched to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings won re-election in 1992 with 51 percent of the vote and
this year faces Rep. Bob Inglis, who has the strong backing of both
the state and national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina: The Democrats' best hope of knocking off an
incumbent may be in the Tarheel State, where conservative Sen.
Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) faces a wealthy trial lawyer from Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   John Edwards posted a strong showing in the primary, beating two
challengers without a runoff. He is accepting no political action
committee money and has invested more than $3 million of his own
money in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama: Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who switched to the
Republican Party in 1994, runs as a Republican for the first time
this year. There isn't much of a contest.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats nominated Clayton Suddith, a retired ironworker who
has raised virtually no money in his bid to unseat Shelby. Shelby
has nearly $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana: The Democrats' bye this election cycle goes to Sen.
John Breaux (D-La.), a popular incumbent who has the support of
many of the state's Republicans. State Rep. Jim Donelon, the
Republican nominee, has been struggling to raise the money to put
his face before voters.Florida: Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), a former
Florida governor, is also enjoying leads in the polls over state
Sen. Charlie Crist, the likely Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Republicans, however, appear poised to elect Jeb Bush,
former President Bush's son, the next governor of Florida. Crist
could benefit from a good Republican showing but still faces long
odds against the popular Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks to come, we will preview some of the more
contentious Southern contests, beginning today with the
Faircloth-Edwards race in North Carolina.

COMMANDO UNITS TRAINED TO SEIZE OR DESTROY TERRORIST WEAPONS  
 (WITH TERRORISM-PENTAGON-UNITS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bracing for a protracted struggle with international terrorists,
the Pentagon is prepared to mount commando strikes against terror
groups or rogue nations that threaten to use weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Units of the multi-service U.S. Special Operations Command are
engaged in intensive practice missions to seize nuclear weapons,
and to destroy chemical or biological factories and storage sites.
The commandos would be used when conventional military firepower,
such as the cruise missiles used in last week's U.S. strikes in
Afghanistan and Sudan, would be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The 47,000-man U.S. Special Operations Command, headquartered at
MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., took on the new mission three years
ago, said retired Gen. Wayne Downing, who commanded the force
during 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been running scenarios for `loose nukes' for the last 10
years,'' Downing said in an interview. But in 1995, the command
received a major infusion of additional funds for new equipment and
training for ``direct action'' operations to find, neutralize and
retrieve nuclear weapons in ``hardened'' or underground sites that
missiles or bombs couldn't damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years a number of rogue states _ particularly North
Korea and Libya _ have built hardened underground nuclear and
chemical weapons factories. These sites are either tunnelled under
mountains or buried so deep that they are likely impervious to
aircraft or missile attack, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Downing and other U.S. experts say the underground sites reflect
the foreign regimes' reaction to the air campaign against Iraq in
the 1991 Persian Gulf War. ``All of our adversaries saw what our
(precision-guided munitions) could do so they put them
underground,'' Downing said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported last week North Korea is digging a
massive underground facility 25 miles northwest of its existing
nuclear plant at Yongbyon that may be a new nuclear weapon
fabrication plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at a whole range of deeply buried
facilities,'' said Dan Goure at the nonprofit Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, D.C. ``Many of them are
built under mountains ... where stuff goes on may be thousands of
meters under rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure said parts of the Yongbyon nuclear complex are deemed
impervious to air strikes, even from a tactical nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very tough targets,'' Downing agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, who was chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff during 1993-97, said preparing to use ``human
sources'' to take out nuclear or chemical weapons ``before they are
used against us'' is a top Pentagon priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is (the special operations force community) putting an
emphasis on developing the training and techniques to do that? The
answer is yes,'' Shalikashvili said. ``Is that a very high
priority? The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Special Operations Command spokesman George Grimes confirmed
that counterproliferation, including the recovery of nuclear
weapons, is the command's ``No. 1 priority mission.'' Grimes said
most details are classified, including which units are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Some details on the role of special operations units are found
in unclassified Pentagon reports to Congress on
counterproliferation, or using the military to thwart the spread of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1, 1998, report cites the U.S. Special Operations Command
mission to include ``supporting, training and equipping (Defense
Department) teams to detect, neutralize and `render safe' ...
weapons and devices in permissive and nonpermissive environments
both in the United States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Special Operations Command, a subordinate unit of the
U.S. Special Operations Command, is a highly classified operation
headquartered at Fort Bragg, N.C. It controls two elite commando
units, the Army's Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta,
known as Delta Force, and the Naval Special Warfare Development
Group, which replaced the Navy's Seal Team 6 as the maritime
counterterrorist force.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Pentagon nor military services officially
acknowledge the existence of Delta or the Navy group. The Army
describes the Joint Special Operations Command only as ``a joint
headquarters designed to study special operations requirements and
techniques; ensure interoperability and equipment standardization;
plan and conduct special operations exercises and training; and
develop joint special operations tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Maj. Gen. Douglas Brown, who took over as head of the
Special Operations Command earlier this month, and his predecessor,
Maj. Gen. Michael Canavan, declined requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Outside sources estimate the ``black,'' or covert, element of
the Special Operations Command consists of fewer than 1,500
hand-picked personnel, including 800 members of Delta Force,
another 200 in the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, and
several hundred support specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of personnel within each commando organization has
the responsibility to operate classified portable detection
equipment to locate and identify weapons, and to neutralize nuclear
devices so they can be retrieved from the target area, one
ex-commando said, speaking on condition his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Downing said many aspects of a counterproliferation mission are
identical to skills the special operations forces have honed for
decades, including covert insertion into a hostile area, secure
communications, long-range reconnaissance and close-quarters
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a planning standpoint we never looked at
counterproliferation as anything different from our tactics,''
agreed the former commando. ``It's just a different form of
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials are tight-lipped about the commando planning,
citing the need to prevent potential adversaries from learning
about U.S. military capability. But some details have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Canavan, commander of the Joint Special Operations Command
during 1997-98, revealed training details in a rare interview last
summer to the trade magazine Armed Forces Journal International.
</P>
<P>
   One such practice mission, involving members of Delta Force,
took place at an underground tunnel complex in Nevada operated by
the Energy Department for nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   The commandos blasted their way through armored doors and
navigated a maze of tunnels thousands of feet long while wearing
sealed protective garments and using closed breathing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Their orders were to locate and fight their way into a guarded
underground facility to seize one or more nuclear weapons before
they could be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the commandos were armed with assault rifles tailored
for close-quarters combat shooting and night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers carried special communications equipment that could
function in the labyrinth of tunnels, and special high-intensity
flares to illuminate their way through the facility.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller number carried portable sensing devices to locate and
identify the radioactive trace emanations from nuclear warhead
material, and highly classified equipment that would enable them to
immobilize _ ``render safe'' _ the weapons so they could be hauled
away.
</P>
<P>
   Canavan described Delta's performance as improving but still
short of the capability Pentagon planners want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're as good as our equipment,'' Canavan said. ``I
think we have about a 60 percent solution out there ... our biggest
challenge is getting into these deep underground shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   Canavan said the greatest challenge facing commandos attacking
an underground target are ``breathing, seeing, communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out to the National Test Site ... where we train,
the tunnels are 3,000 meters long,'' Canavan told the magazine.
``And if the tunnel is full of dust you can't see. We have a
two-million candlepower flare (but in one instance) we couldn't see
the door until we were six inches from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Seal commandos have focused their planning and training
toward interdiction of sensitive weapons or weapon materials at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is installing a ship-mounted system that can identify
trace elements from nuclear, chemical or biological materials
loaded aboard ships. The experimental system has been installed on
several dozen warships, according to the Pentagon
counterproliferation report.
</P>
<P>
   Other special operations units, such as the Army's three Ranger
battalions and Special Forces groups assigned to other military
commands, would likely provide combat support to commandos in any
mission, officials said. The Rangers, for example, could be used to
seize an airfield to allow the commandos to be brought in.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on the nature of an incident, outside experts from
the Energy Department, FBI or U.S. intelligence community might be
included in a raiding force to provide specific expertise.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNITS TRAINED TO ATTACK TERRORIST SITES  
 (WITH TERRORISM-PENTAGON) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four units from the multi-service U.S. Special Operations
Command would have responsiblility for attacking hardened
underground sites to destroy or seize nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons in the hands of terror groups or rogue nations.
They are:
</P>
<P>
   Joint Special Operations Command: Highly classified headquarters
unit under the U.S. Special Operations Command that supervises
counter-terrorist commando units. The staff of several hundred is
based at Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta: Activated as a
primarily counter-terrorist unit in 1979, Delta Force is believed
to number about 800 commandos and support personnel. It led the
ill-fated 1980 embassy hostage rescue mission in Iran. Delta Force
commandos took part in a successful hostage rescue mission during
the 1989 intervention in Panama, and operated behind the Iraqi
lines during Operation Desert Storm hunting for Scud missiles in
1991. Delta commandos also have participated in several operations
responding to terrorism, including the attempt to capture the
Palestinian hijackers of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro in
1986. The unit is based at Fort Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   Naval Special Warfare Development Group: The commando unit
replaced the original Navy counterterrorist unit Seal Team 6,
formed in 1980 to fight terrorists in a maritime environment. It
took part in the 1983 Grenada intervention where several members
were killed in action. In 1992, members of the unit made a rescue
in Haiti of several former Haitian government officials whose lives
were in danger. The unit is based in Hampton Roads, Va.
</P>
<P>
   160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment: Known as the ``Night
Stalkers,'' the helicopter unit serves as a helicopter delivery arm
for Delta Force commandos. The regiment was in combat in Panama and
Operation Desert Storm. It is based at Fort Campbell, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialized units: The Defense Department, Energy
Department, FBI, Army, Navy and Marines could provide technical
expertise and limited manpower depending on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Units include the Energy Department Nuclear Emergency Search
Team, which can draw among several thousand nuclear weapon design
experts to locate and identify nuclear weapons or warhead
materials; the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams, who work
with other military units to deactivate munitions, including
nuclear weapons; the Army Technical Escort Unit, with experts in
the identification and neutralization of chemical agents; the
Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Incident Response Force, a
300-member unit configured for rapid response to chemical or
biological incidents; and FBI Hostage Response Team, a commando
unit empowered to respond to terrorist incidents within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Other Special Operations units: For counterproliferation
missions overseas, the non-classified branch of the U.S. Special
Operations Command would likely provide intelligence and combat
reinforcements for a commando mission. Units include:
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Special Operations Command: Headquartered at Hurlburt
Field, Fla., the organization flies both planes and helicopters
configured for covert, long-range flights and penetration of
hostile areas. The command also operates AC-130 gunships that can
deliver artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Army Rangers: Members of the 75th Ranger Regiment, including the
Fort Lewis-based 2nd Ranger Battalion, are trained to support
special operations missions. Their role would be to seize strategic
areas such as airfields, then provide firepower support for
commandos.
</P>
<P>
   Army Special Forces: These five, battalion-sized units,
including the 1st Special Forces Group at Fort Lewis, would provide
expertise in a particular geographic area, including local contacts
and language assistance, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Seal Teams: Six conventional Navy Seal teams _ three on
each coast _ could provide seaborne combat power to a
counterproliferation operation. Other Navy special warfare units
could provide transportation on high-speed patrol craft or
mini-subs launched from submarines.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock market investors around the world rushed the
exits Thursday. The depth of the economic problems in Russia and
Asia proved too unfathomable for investors, who scoured the
horizons for a haven.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 4.19 percent, or 357.36 points, to close at 8165.99.
The Nasdaq fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow average now 12.5 percent below its July 17 high of
9337.97, investors are well into what Wall Street calls a
correction. Bear market territory _ defined as a stock price
decline of 15 percent to 20 percent _ is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Investors struggled to absorb the full impact of Russia's
economic woes _ its central bank has stopped supporting the ruble
and has defaulted on its ruble-denominated debt. Institutions that
had bought the country's debt saw the value of their holdings fall
to around 10 percent of its worth just last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear that the economic unraveling in Russia could spread
to the emerging market countries of Latin America acted as the
greatest depressant on stocks worldwide. Indeed, investors
everywhere wondered which economy would be the next to crumple.
</P>
<P>
   Major markets fell, with the exception of Hong Kong. In Europe,
key indexes fell 3 percent to 6 percent, with the Dax in Germany
dropping 4.5 percent. Latin America's markets were punished even
more, with Mexico's main index falling 6 percent and Brazil's
nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment over Japan's inability to repair its broken-down
economy drove the Nikkei 225 index down 3.04 percent long before
trading began in the United States. Policy paralysis seems to have
overtaken Japanese politicians, who appear unwilling to take steps
to solve their country's well-documented economic and banking
problems. The Nikkei has fallen 16.5 percent this year from its
March high.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market opened in the United States, traders and
money managers reported a flood of early selling, selling that
continued in waves all day. Even though stocks tried to rally
several times, few, if any, buyers were willing to pick through the
rubble for bargains. The market closed at its low, a sign of
overwhelming market weakness and a sign of caution for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of big international banks, which were down an average of
6.6 percent, were among the hardest hit on fears of Russia-related
losses. But rampant selling ravaged even the most favored stocks,
such as Coca-Cola, General Electric and Microsoft, as well as
Internet darlings Excite Inc. and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering of the healthiest companies can be attributed in
part to selling by investors who had to raise cash because of
losses on their emerging market investments. When an investor has
to cough up cash because he has borrowed heavily to make foreign
investments that are cratering, he sells whatever he can. Often
that means the biggest, most liquid investment. Or the investment
that still shows a profit.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vicious circle, said William Dudley, an economist at
Goldman, Sachs in New York. ``People are becoming increasingly risk
averse, leading to lower equity prices, increasing pressure on
emerging market economies. Absent right now is any mechanism to
break that dynamic up.'' As a result, Dudley suggests that
investors brace for more market declines.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news started early. At 9:46 a.m., shares in the Republic
New York Corporation, the parent of Republic National Bank of New
York, were halted from trading. Minutes later, the bank announced
it would take a $110 million charge in the third quarter for losses
in Russian government bonds. The loss would virtually eliminate
earnings for the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it became clear that the ultimate impact of the
Russian disaster was still unknown. If Republic Bank, known for its
strong balance sheet and conservative lending practices, was hurt
by Russia, what would happen to more aggressive lenders?
</P>
<P>
   With that announcement, Republic Bank became the first domestic
bank to enumerate its Russian losses. Market historians noted that
Republic was also the first domestic bank, back in the mid-1980s,
to reveal the extent of its exposure to lesser-developed country
debt that later hammered Citicorp and many other American banks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in financial stocks Thursday found themselves in a
nightmarish version of the child's game of hot potato. Exposure to
Russia's ruble devaluation and effective default on its debt is
only starting to be defined. And since many of the losses will be
taken by investors who bought or sold derivative securities, where
the parties who took the other side of a given trade are not
immediately identifiable, it could be weeks before it is known who
is on the hook for what may be $100 billion in losses. In the
meantime, investors ask: Losses, losses, who's got the losses?
</P>
<P>
   Some investors wondered why a country as economically
inconsequential as Russia should play such a big role in world
market turmoil. Yes, Russia wields nuclear firepower, but it
accounts for just 1 percent of the world's trade, roughly
equivalent to that of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted, though, that what happened in Russia could very
well replay in the emerging markets of Latin America. When
investors see their portfolios lose 90 percent of their value, as
those holding Russian debt have, two things happen. Assets in other
emerging markets need to fall in price to reflect the new economic
reality. And, as those assets are repriced, investors and lenders
withdraw from the markets, cutting off companies' access to capital
and making financing more expensive for governments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's default also made it painfully obvious that the
International Monetary Fund is no longer ready or able to bail out
countries in economic despair. Bailouts in Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand had lulled investors into believing that the IMF was
effectively a guarantor of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   So what investors are facing now is the very thing Wall Street
fears the most: the unknown. The devil we know, an imploding Russia
in this case, is bad enough. The devil we don't know, what other
economic disasters lie ahead, most particularly in Latin America,
is considerably worse.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on Latin America. That's because a crisis in these
nations would strike a severe blow to both American investors and
corporations. Some 25 percent of Brazil's $300 billion in domestic
debt, for example, is held by foreign investors. More important,
around 20 percent of United States exports go to Latin America.

<P>
   Even in the United States, the stock market carnage is worse
than it first appears. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette reported
Thursday that the average stock was down 38 percent from its high.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager said that the selling was overdone and the
result of investors buying stocks only because they are going up.
``People have been investing by the direction of earnings and not
looking at value,'' said David Eidelman, at Eidelman, Finger,
Harris &AMP; Co. in St. Louis. ``If earnings are going higher, they
buy. But when they start to see earnings come down, they look at
the direction not the value. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, these
investors, so-called momentum players, know the price of everything
and the value of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the slide Thursday, brokerage firms asked
investors who had borrowed to buy stocks to prop up their depleted
portfolios with more cash, known as margin calls.
</P>
<P>
   More than one professional trader said that Thursday's action in
United States stocks was reminiscent of the beginning of the end of
the great bull market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. These
traders recalled that the 1973 bear market, which removed 45
percent from the Dow Jones industrial average, did not begin in
earnest until the Nifty Fifty stocks _ names like Polaroid, Avon
and IBM crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, approximately 15 stocks _ including Dell
Computer, Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems _ had held up while
the rest of the United States market had fallen. Thursday, even
these shares fell hard.

EMBASSY BOMBING SUSPECT ARRAIGNED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (lowercases first `a' in al-'Owhali; recasts story to give more
prominence to second suspect and for editorial smoothing)  (See also ATTACK-ARRAIGN) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities brought a suspect in the
bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the United
States on Thursday, saying that he had admitted that he was trained
at terror camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born multimillionaire suspected of having inspired, organized
and financed the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have also seized a second suspect for
prosecution. This suspect, who provided one of the first breaks in
the case, is expected to reach New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The first suspect, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, was said to
have acknowledged that he rode as a passenger in the truck that
carried the massive bomb to the Nairobi embassy, according to a
detailed criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali was said to have told investigators that he threw a
dummy grenade at a security guard seconds before the blast and then
prepared to die in a bombing that he said was designed as a
``martyrdom operation in which he did not expect to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali survived the explosion, though fragments from the
blast left a large wound in his back and cuts on his hands and
face. And Thursday, the slight, bearded man with a bandage on one
wrist was brought by FBI agents from Nairobi to a New York
courtroom. U.S. Magistrate Sharon Grubin informed him of the
charges against him, including conspiracy to commit murder, the use
of a weapon of mass destruction and 12 counts of murder, one each
for the dozen Americans who died in the Nairobi bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, has been in custody in
Nairobi for nearly two weeks, law-enforcement officials said. He
was initially detained on a flight from Nairobi to Karachi,
Pakistan, on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings. Pakistani officials
have said that Odeh provided extensive details of his role in the
plot. But pending his arrival in New York, federal officials would
not discuss the case against Odeh in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the decision to bring the two suspects
to New York was related to the sealed grand jury indictment
returned against bin Laden in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That federal grand jury is expected to hear evidence about the
bombings and may return a superseding indictment that would be used
to bring prosecutions in New York against those said to be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Any statements to U.S. authorities by Odeh or al-'Owhali could
be presented to the grand jury as evidence against bin Laden, who
came under federal investigation after the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993. Officials said the sealed indictment of bin Laden
was issued before the East Africa bombings and charges him with
several terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, FBI Director Louis Freeh would
not discuss bin Laden's legal status nor would he comment on
reports that the indictment accused bin Laden of plotting to kill
President Clinton in 1994 during a visit to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali first emerged as a possible suspect when Kenyan
authorities contacted him two days after the bombing in Nairobi,
according to a federal complaint signed by FBI Agent Daniel
Coleman. He was arrested on that day, and confessed to taking part
in the plot during two interviews with FBI investigators on Aug. 12
and Aug. 20, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, he told investigators he traveled
from Lahore, Pakistan to Kenya on July 31. With several
unidentified confederates he went to the embassy Aug. 4, three days
before the bombing to inspect the buildings and grounds in
preparation for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the bombing, the complaint said, al-'Owhali, along
with another man traveled in a truck carrying a huge homemade bomb
from an undisclosed location in Kenya to the embassy. The identity
of the driver or whether he survived was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali first told Kenyan authorities _ apparently while he
was in a hospital _ that he had been wounded while standing on an
embankment with a friend as the explosion occurred. But the Kenyans
were suspicious because he said he was wearing the clothes he wore
at the time of the blast, although they showed no traces of blood
from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Kenyans that he had thrown away in a hospital
bathroom two keys that fit a padlock on the rear of the bomb-laden
vehicle and three bullets from a gun he had left behind in the
truck. Hospital employees later retrieved the keys and bullets from
the area that al-'Owhali described.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali told the investigators that he had been trained in a
number of camps in Afghanistan, including ``camps affiliated with
al Qaeda, an international terrorist group, led by bin Laden.'' At
the bin Laden camps, al-'Owhali said he was trained in the tools of
terror, including explosives, hijacking and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews recounted in the complaint, al-'Owhali
said he attended conferences and meetings with bin Laden and knew
of an order, signed by bin Laden and other militants, saying that
American civilians were legitimate targets of terrorist acts. In
the Kenya and Tanzania bombings, more than 250 people died and more
than 5,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant was flown to a military airport in upstate New
York on Wednesday night and taken by helicopter under heavy guard
to FBI headquarters in Manhattan. He was being held in a federal
jail next to the U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, al-'Owhali also completed a financial affidavit,
in support of an application for a court appointed lawyer. In it he
said that he was unmaried, had no home and had never been employed.
But he reported that he had $12,000 from his father and owned a
1992 Chevrolet Caprice. Al-'Owhali had been identified as Yemeni
citizen, but officials in that country denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The two were seized under U.S. laws that make it a federal crime
to carry out terrorist attacks overseas, and Kenya agreed to their
capture.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, al-'Owhali could face a maximum sentence of
death or life in prison. He was ordered held pending a hearing
Sept. 28. His court-appointed lawyer, Yuanchung Lee, would not
comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at FBI headquarters, senior law enforcement
and diplomatic officials here hailed the action as an important
victory in the U.S. war against terror, in large part because they
had succeeded in bringing a suspect in an overseas attack from
Africa into a U.S. court within 20 days of the bombing
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said Thursday that no decision had made on where to try
al-'Owhali. Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York, appearing
at a news conference at FBI headquarters in New York, suggesting
that any defendants in the bombing plot would probably be tried in
New York.

RIDING RADIO MERGER WAVE, CHANCELLOR WILL BUY CAPSTAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The radio merger wave started by deregulation two years
ago has reached a new crest. Chancellor Media Corp. said Thursday
that it planned to buy Capstar Broadcasting Corp. for $2.3 billion
in stock plus nearly $1.8 billion in assumed debt, surpassing CBS
as the nation's largest chain of radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have 463 stations with more than 65
million listeners in 105 markets and revenues of about $2.3
billion. While such consolidation has reduced the industry's
expenses and raised its profitability, critics say that diverse
local ownership is rapidly vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Media's position is substantially the work of Hicks,
Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, the leveraged buyout firm, which has sought to
capitalize on relaxed restrictions on how many stations one company
can own. Hicks, Muse owns about 15 percent of Chancellor and 59
percent of Capstar and stands to hold 25 percent of the combined
company. Thomas Hicks, chairman of Hicks, Muse, is also chairman of
Chancellor and Capstar and his brother Steven is Capstar's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor hopes to appeal to national advertisers wishing to
saturate local markets by offering them clusters of radio stations
along with its television stations _ which are part of its pending
acquisition of Lin Television _ and its billboards.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the value of such chains, CBS announced Thursday
that it would sell the public 20 percent of its radio operations.
The Capstar acquisition was expected; Hicks and Jeffrey Marcus, the
chief executive of Chancellor, have long spoken of such plans.
Combining the companies will yield about $70 million a year in cash
flow _ or earnings before debt payments and depreciation _ because
of increased efficiency and revenue, they said. The companies
otherwise expect total cash flow of about $1.2 billion next year.
Chancellor, which has 108 stations in 22 large markets, can bring
its more sophisticated sales abilities to Capstar, which has 355
stations in medium-sized markets, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the magic that occurs in the larger markets in the
business we're bringing to the medium and smaller markets,'' Marcus
said. Even the big-city announcers could handle work for groups of
smaller stations.
</P>
<P>
   Capstar, in fact, already runs many ``virtual stations,'' which
have no announcers of their own but instead deliver feeds from
distant announcers who tape or broadcast shows for other stations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts applaud the prospects for such
efficiencies to raise the profit margins of smaller stations, which
are typically lower than those of larger stations. And some
analysts wondered whether Chancellor was paying enough. ``I was a
little disappointed in the price that Capstar got, though it was
certainly in the realm of reasonableness,'' said Gordon Hodge of
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of the large Hicks, Muse presence in both companies,
working out terms that other shareholders would consider fair
required extra time, with most of Wall Street's leading firms
advising one party or the other. Marcus said he expected the deal
to improve Chancellor's earnings performance next year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's consolidation has drawn attacks, however, from
some who say that consolidated ownership has stifled local radio
voices. ``This is what we're getting,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a law firm
representing civil rights groups, referring to the Chancellor
announcement. ``More and more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for Chancellor to trade at least 0.48 share
for each Capstar share, or as much as 0.505 share depending on
Capstar's performance for the rest of the year. In the broader
market rout, shares of Chancellor fell $2, to $42.75, and Capstar
dropped $2.1875, to $19.3125.

DOES CHERNOMYRDIN'S POLITICAL STRATEGY MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE?

(bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his drive to consolidate his power, Viktor
Chernomyrdin has embarked on the first attempt since the fall of
the Soviet Union to negotiate a sharing of power between the
remains of the Communist Party and the tycoons who arose from the
ashes of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has sent clear signals that he wants to form a
coalition government that embraces both tycoons and Communists. But
the prospects for an effort to reconcile such opposing forces are
unclear, and the politics of Chernomyrdin's coalition-building is
at odds with the economic crisis in which Russia finds itself.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, how can Chernomyrdin be all things to all men and
still make the tough decisions that will enable Russia to extract
itself from the rapidly escalating economic crisis?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most difficult questions for him,''
observed Boris Nemtsov, a reform-minded former Kremlin aide who was
part of the government that was dismissed this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, he has to organize a strong and professional
government to avoid big failures and big mistakes,'' Nemtsov added.
``On the other hand, he has to compromise with the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing the short-term political logic behind
Chernomyrdin's hints about a coalition government _ or, as he puts
it, a ``government of accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's appointment as prime minister needs the approval
of the Communist-dominated Parliament. To establish himself as a
figure of national reconciliation _ and advance his longer-term
presidential ambitions _ Chernomyrdin would like to be approved
overwhelming by Parliament and on the first vote.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that he is ready to trade government posts for
parliamentary votes. President Boris Yeltsin has given Chernomyrdin
enormous latitude in forming his government. As the newspaper
Izvestia put in a headline early this week, ``Yeltsin Yields
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a matter of jobs or confirmation votes. The
Communist opposition has made it plain that they are also looking
for more left-leaning economic policies. As Gennady Seleznyov, a
Communist who is the speaker of Parliament, put it, ``if
Chernomyrdin recognizes our anti-crisis program and decides to
implement it, his appointment will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Chernomyrdin's allies have
flirted with the idea of coalition rule. During the 1996
presidential election campaign, some of Yeltsin's leading financial
backers became so fearful that the Communists might win that they
issued an open letter calling for an accommodation between the
Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, the tycoon who helped mastermind
Chernomyrdin's return to power, was among the group.
</P>
<P>
   But extricating Russia from its current crisis _ or at least
limiting the damage _ will also require decisions that irritate the
Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chernomyrdin, Russia must control the money supply to
fight inflation, husband the government's dwindling resources by
limiting subsidies to failing banks, and reassure foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chernomyrdin has straddled the fence. He has talked
about continuing the march toward a free market. But he has also
echoed some of the Communists' favorite slogans.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for instance, that he would change ``industrial policy,
because by purely monetarist measures, we will not pull Russia out
of the crisis.'' That was a sop toward the Communist demands that
the Kremlin print more money and use government credits to prop up
ailing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Chernomyrdin was trying to stroke the Communists, he
rushed off to the Crimea for a meeting with Michel Camdessus, the
managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has
given Russia a small part of the $17 billion rescue bailout that
was negotiated in July, and Chernomyrdin wants to make sure that
the money keeps flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was not accompanied by a Communist deputy. He was
joined by Boris Fyodorov, the blunt-spoken economic aide who also
serves as the nation's chief tax collector. Fyodorov is a staunch
advocate of the free market and has told associates that if he were
a U.S. citizen, he would be a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the IMF nor average Russians will know exactly where
Chernomyrdin stands until he begins to make tough decisions on
collecting taxes, cutting the budget deficit and saving the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the appointments to the Chernomyrdin team will
give some indication where he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to take advantage of Chernomyrdin's willingness to
compromise, the Communists have demanded at least 10 of the top
posts, including those involved in overseeing finance and industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the industrial barons who backed Chernomyrdin have their eye
on these jobs as well. Pyotr Aven, the head of Alpha Bank, is said
to be interested in running the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   And this equation does not take into account Chernomyrdin's own
party, Our Home is Russia, which believes that it should dominate
the upper rungs of power and is the second biggest party in
Parliament after the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a cadre of experienced government aides like
Fyodorov. Some of them are close to Chernomyrdin, who has stressed
the value of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sergei Kiriyenko was dismissed as prime minister this
week, the Yeltsin government was on a collision course with the
Communists in Parliament. Forming an alliance might seem a safer
course to Chernomyrdin, but coalition politics also has its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up Russia's addled political scene, Izvestia noted that
Chernomyrdin's attempts to negotiate were encouraging some members
of the leftist opposition to harden their demands. ``The game
between the leftist opposition with the prime minister has become
dangerous for the country,'' it said.

LOST IN SURF, OR MAYBE EVADING ARREST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ With Hurricane Bonnie bearing down on the Eastern
Seaboard and rough surf advisories in effect, it was just the type
of emergency call that rescue workers had been bracing for.
Kimberly Kuda flagged down a police officer in Point Pleasant Beach
just after 7:30 p.m. Monday to say her future husband had been
swept into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As a Coast Guard helicopter and rescue boats frantically
searched the dark, gnashing ocean, Ms. Kuda, 21, appeared so
distraught that an emergency psychiatric team was brought in to
help, said Detective Sgt. Harry DiCorcia of the Point Pleasant
Beach police. But now, after unexpected twists, investigators say
they believe that her fiance, Antonio Mandarino Jr., 23, may still
be alive and that his drowning and her distress were a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   First, a telephone caller suggested to the police that
Mandarino, who has a long criminal record, might have faked his
drowning to avoid prosecution on a number of charges in Bergen
County. Then, Ms. Kuda also disappeared. Police officials said she
was apparently the only person to witness Mandarino's alleged
drowning. So Thursday, the authorities again mounted a search.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, they had no need for the Coast Guard.
Instead, Point Pleasant police teamed up with the Bergen County
Sheriff's office to try to find the couple, particularly Mandarino,
who has previously been arrested in at least a half dozen northern
New Jersey towns on charges including marijuana and gun possession,
assault, aggravated assault, passing bad checks, shoplifting and
receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County Sheriff Jay Alpert said Mandarino was scheduled to
appear in Bergen County Superior Court in Hackensack on Sept. 14 to
face a charge of eluding the police. Fred Schwanwede, the first
assistant prosecutor in Bergen County, said Mandarino had escaped
from a detective who was trying to stop him for questioning in
Saddle Brook, N.J. Officials would not say what the detective
wanted to question Mandarino about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly at this point that it's nothing more than a
hoax,'' Alpert said. ``And it goes beyond just a false police
report. You have people that risked their lives. Divers that were
down there, going into rough surf, looking for somebody they
thought was there, which is something that is almost
incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The search included a Coast Guard helicopter with a crew of four
and rescue workers in boats, including a 41-foot Coast Guard
utility boat and a rigid-hull inflatable craft, said Petty Officer
Mike LaPearl. The helicopter costs $3,638 an hour to operate, he
said, the utility boat $313 an hour and the rigid-hull inflatable
$233 an hour. In all, officials estimated the cost of the rescue
effort at more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert said that he and his wife had watched news accounts of
Mandarino's drowning and that their hearts had gone out to the
heartbroken fiancee. ``It evokes all kinds of emotions,'' he said.
``A young couple supposed to get married in November, she's sitting
on the beach and sees her fiance whisked away by a wave. Now, she
has disappeared and is presumably with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives are searching for the couple and for Ms. Kuda's
silver 1997 Mercury Tracer, with New Jersey license plate RF394H,
he said .
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ms. Kuda left Point Pleasant police headquarters
about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday and returned to the house in Oakland, N.J.,
where she lived with her fiance and his father. Late that morning,
she gave an interview by telephone to The (Hackensack) Record. ``He
went into the water, and I saw a wave come and take him in,'' she
told the newspaper. She also said they had gone to the shore
because they could not afford to take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Mandarino's father, Antonio Mandarino Sr., has told local
newspapers that he believes his son may still be alive. Reached by
telephone, he said he did not know where the couple might be or
what had happened to his son. ``He's not here,'' the father said.
``I don't know where he is. You got to talk to his girlfriend. If
you could find her, she knows everything. I don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Ms. Kuda flagged down an officer for help
shortly after 7:30 p.m. Monday, saying her fiance had been standing
in knee-deep water. Ms. Kuda reported that ``a wave knocked him
down and took him into the ocean and that was the last she saw of
him,'' DiCorcia said.
</P>
<P>
   If Mandarino is found and faces the Bergen County charge of
eluding police, he could face five to 10 years in prison if
convicted. But if the drowning was a hoax, officials said, he and
Ms. Kuda could face considerably more serious charges.

MORE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS APPEAR TO SHIFT AWAY FROM STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Individual investors, whose determination to buy
stocks whenever the market takes a tumble has been the bulwark of
the bull market of the 1990s, appear to be weakening under the
weight of a monthlong decline in equity prices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, individuals have been pouring more of their new
cash into the safe haven of money-market funds than into any other
investment category, while at the same time many of them have been
pulling money out of stocks. So far, August appears to be the
weakest month for new purchases of equity mutual funds in several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the country's largest sellers of mutual funds _
including Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and T. Rowe
Price Associates _ said Thursday their customers have pulled more
money out of equity funds in August than they put in. Others,
however, including the Vanguard Group, say that investors have been
net buyers of equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the fund companies report a significant jump in flows
of cash into money market and fixed-income funds, another shelter
typically sought by investors in times of market turmoil. In
addition, there are signs that the skittishness has spread to
investors in 401(k) and similar retirement plans, who typically
have been less likely to make quick shifts from one asset class to
another.
</P>
<P>
   What apparently has been weighing on investors' resolve is the
slow-and- steady decline of stock prices since the market indexes
hit new highs in July. A volatile market has provided a few days of
rapid gains, but those have inevitably been followed by further
declines, as the slump has stretched from days into weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while broad market indicators like the Dow Jones
industrial average still show gains for the year, a growing number
of mutual funds, which generally buy stocks that are smaller than
those in the market indexes, have lost money since the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even at fund companies where investors have continued to buy
equity funds, they appear less steadfast than in previous market
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cash flow remains strong, but the numbers appear to be
very volatile,'' with heavy inflows one week and none the next,
said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express
Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. ``That tells me that people are
a little uncertain. What every investor has been taught is to buy
the dips. It takes some time to disabuse them of the notion. But I
think it's slowly beginning to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few days of trading left in August, it is not yet clear
whether the universe of all equity funds will suffer net
withdrawals for the month, which has not happened in the mutual
fund industry since September 1990. Two data services that track
mutual fund cash flows on a weekly basis, AMG Data Services and
Trim Tabs Financial Services, report that U.S. equity funds have
taken in slightly more money than they paid out in August.
</P>
<P>
   But even those small inflows would be a dramatic decline from
the $19.3 billion that flowed into equity funds in July. According
to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, $145.5 billion
flowed into stock funds in the first seven months of the year,
nearly 8 percent more than in the same period last year and an
average of almost $21 billion per month.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees a negative sign in the recent slowdown in
purchases of equity funds. Charles Biderman, president of Trim Tabs
Financial Services, of Santa Rosa, Calif., said that individuals
have continued to invest nearly $4 billion per week. Instead of
going into stock funds this month, however, it has been temporarily
parked in money-market funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund managers have accumulated $30 billion in cash this month,
and individuals have put another $20 billion into money-market
funds,'' Biderman said. ``That means there's $50 billion on the
sidelines waiting for the market to stabilize,'' which he called a
bullish sign.
</P>
<P>
   Among the large mutual fund companies, only Vanguard offered
evidence of recent bullishness among equity investors. Based on
flows so far this month, Vanguard expects its stock funds will take
in about $1.7 billion in new money this month, roughly half of
July's total, according to Brian Mattes, a Vanguard principal.
Almost as much, about $1.6 billion, is expected to flow into money
market funds, which Attes said ``is certainly the highest amount in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a measure of caution being shown,'' he said.
``Investors are not making big exchanges out of equities, but money
that might have otherwise found its way into the equity market is
going into more conservative categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, investors were cashing in some of their stock
investments. At Fidelity Investments, the country's biggest fund
company, more than $1.8 billion flowed out of stock funds while
more than $4.5 billion flowed into money market funds, said Scott
Beyerl, a Fidelity spokesman. T. Rowe Price saw ``moderate net
outflows'' from its equity funds for the first time in five years,
said Steven Norwitz, a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And at Charles Schwab in San Francisco, which sells the mutual
funds of several hundred fund companies, nearly $1.9 billion fled
from equity funds, said spokesman Greg Gable. The last time that
withdrawals exceeded new deposits in stock funds sold through
Schwab's Mutual Fund marketplace was in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a kind of steady withdrawal from equity funds over
the past month, unlike in some of the past downturns where you get
a sharp decline and investors return right afterwards,'' Gable
said. He said individuals who invest directly in equities had
generally still been putting some new money into stocks, continuing
to buy after sharp market declines.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals from equity funds at some of the largest fund
companies might not be worrisome if they were restricted to
investors who use mutual funds to time the markets, quickly darting
in and out when they believe a sudden upward or downward move is
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   But a new measure of trading activity among investors in 401(k)
programs, devised by pension consultant Hewitt Associates, shows
that in the last month investors have been three times more likely
to shift money out of stocks and into the safer havens.
</P>
<P>
   The recently introduced Hewitt 401(k) Index tracks the daily
transfer activity of 1.4 million participants in large-company
401(k) plans with $62 billion in assets. On 17 of the the 23 days
that the financial markets were open from July 27 through
Wednesday, investors shifted money out of equity funds and into
fixed-income funds, according to Hewitt. That resulted in a net
shift of $484 million of those retirement plan assets out of stocks
over the past month.

KEITH JACKSON: THE LEGEND OF THE FALL MAKES HIS LAST CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Burt Harrison doesn't pretend to deserve any
credit for how Keith Jackson turned out as a sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   But the 81-year-old former professor from Washington State
College's school of radio broadcasting (it didn't include TV then)
did know one thing. This kid, who in the early '50s barged into his
office and demanded he be given a shot at doing play-by-play on the
campus radio station, would never embarrass himself behind a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (ital)had(end ital) it, there's no getting around that ...
He was a good, hard-working student, very colorful, a hell of a
broadcaster even then, and a nut about doing sports,'' Harrison
said of the 20-year-old who had just left the Marines and had
enlisted at the school in Pullman, Wash., later to be named
Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's academic pursuit then was in police science, or what
today is known as criminal justice. Somewhere inside he admits was
a sportscaster he didn't know about waiting to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of lured him away,'' Harrison said, without much
regret.
</P>
<P>
   The only regret college football fans have this season is this
will be the last for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   College football (ital)is(end ital) Keith Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing games since he was a sophomore at Washington
State in 1952 _ his first was the Cougars' 14-13 loss to Bob
Mathias' Stanford team. He has missed just one season, that to be
the first play-by-play man on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who turns 70 in October, begins his final ``Whoa,
Nellie!'' tour with Monday's Kickoff Classic in New Jersey between
Florida State and Texas A&AMP;M. His final two broadcasts are the Jan.
1 Rose Bowl and the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl, which this year guarantees
a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup.
</P>
<P>
   When his 32nd season doing college football at ABC ends, he'll
have called nearly 500 games, making cities like Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
and Ann Arbor, Mich., seem like magic places on Saturday mornings
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone realized I'm just getting to be an old
goat,'' Jackson said Thursday, when asked if anyone has tried to
talk him out of retirement. ``It's not a sudden thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a farewell tour. I know it could be emotional.
I'm an old Marine and I'm pretty crusty. When I'm backed into a
corner, I can crack and break. I don't want this to be a
distraction. I probably should have kept my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   If that had happened, he would have never gotten into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, son of dirt farmers in western Georgia, actually rode a
horse to high school. He was the freshman class president at WSC
and drove a garbage truck for $4 an hour for pocket money. He was
sitting in a dorm room one day listening to a game on KWSC, the
5,000-watt student-run station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a better job than that guy,'' Jackson thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson rumbled over to Harrison's office at the campus studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a better job than that guy,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his
mouth as he was pounding out a manuscript on his Underwood
typewriter, looked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear that (expletive),'' Harrison said,
handing him a tape recorder and a few cassettes. ``Go do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson covered a high school game, came back with the tape and
was hired to work at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his graduation in '54, he worked for 10 years at Seattle TV
station KOMO and moved to Sherman Oaks in 1964 to become a radio
news correspondent and sports director at ABC Radio West. Two years
later, he was doing college football for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years each with Bud Wilkinson and Frank Broyles as his
partner, one with Ara Parseghian and the last dozen with Bob Griese
at his side, Jackson's down-home style has made an imprint on the
game that viewers will likely never feel again in this era of
half-billion-dollar TV contracts and high-stake coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, always outspoken about his dislike of the
commercialization of the sport, is never shy about promoting it as
well. Somehow, he can get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always accuse me of selling it and promoting it,'' said
Jackson. ``I'm not a journalist. How can I be? We're not going on
the air to say this game is a bad product. We're in this fix
because of the money we (in TV) brought to it.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Jackson's annual low-key sales pitch will
definitely be missed. And he'll miss it in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football has become a festival with the flavor and
ambiance,'' he said. ``It's about the band with 300 students who
all have mommas and daddies from little towns. It's a happy
setting, not like some sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more fun than anyone on these games. If I've helped
people enjoy the telecast, that's fine. That's my purpose. If a guy
blows a thousand bucks on a color TV, he doesn't care what I have
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the game is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: JACKSON CAN'T EMBRACE HIS `WHOA NELLIE'
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Keith Jackson's wife of 46 years is named Turi
Ann. Not Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   And the phrase ``Whoa Nellie!'' is something he credits _ or
blames _ sportscaster Roy Firestone for pinning on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to think of when I could have said that,
and I know I've said some pretty dumb things,'' said Jackson when
asked about the two words that anyone who mimicks him seems to
repeat the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what? I don't even think about it too much. I don't think
I have a staple phrase. I only use it (during games) now when
(broadcast partner) Bob Griese goaded me into doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Lane used it during roller derby and wrestling broadcasts
from the Olympic Auditorium on KTLA back in the '50s, but Jackson
thinks it somehow got pinned on him by those who do imitations of
him, such as Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I did say it,'' he admits, ``but I had a mule that was
named Pearl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Nellie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STATION BREAK:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- A Pepperdine alumnus done good. Bob Weir, a quick, funny and
popular morning sports anchor at WGN in Chicago, will soon fill the
role of overpaid and overemphasized sports guy at KABC Channel 7.
The hiring effectively eliminates not only the incredibly smart but
painfully annoying Todd Donoho (who is free to pursue his game-show
career) but also the not-so-quick Rick Lozano from the rotation.
Until Weir arrives, Donoho will continue to do the extremely
irritating ``Monday Night Live'' postgame time-filler after each
ABC ``Monday Night Football'' game, an often unsuccessful attempt
by the station each week to keep at least half the 20-rating
audience generated by the game. Weir expects to be through at WGN
by next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES:
</P>
<P>
   -- Last season, USC had 14 affiliates on the radio broadcast
network. This week, the school announced it has a whopping four for
the upcoming season _ including another one in L.A. In addition to
the XTRA-AM (690) flagship, Trojans football will compete with
itself on the city's One-on-One Sports station, KCTD-AM (1540).
Will the signal be better in the San Fernando Valley now? We'll
see. USC can also be heard on KGEO-AM (1230) in Bakersfield,
KYNO-AM (1300) in Fresno and KDEF-AM (1150) in Albuquerque, N.M.,
if, by some unfortunate circumstance, you happen to be driving
through Bakersfield, Fresno or Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   -- XTRA's other station, AM-1150, can't be heard in
Riverside/San Bernardino, even though it's within 30 miles of the
transmitter. So the Dodgers games have been farmed out to
Riverside's AM-1440 station. It's an all-Spanish station, by the
way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ Beside an overturned basketball goal in Morehead
City, N.C., Jim Cantore abandoned the comparative safety of his
Weather Channel ``live'' truck, planted his feet, squinted one eye
against the blowing rain and, with his pants legs flapping madly
and the wind itself rushing into the microphone, brought Hurricane
Bonnie into America's living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On a trembling dock in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., Kerry Sanders,
an NBC correspondent, braced himself against a boat's mast and,
apparently in some danger of being blown into the surging water,
went live with the news that the storm's winds had reached almost
70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In a parking lot in Wilmington, N.C., protected from the wind
but not rain by a hotel wall, a bedraggled-looking Martin Savidge
gave periodic updates to CNN viewers while shelter waited just
steps away.
</P>
<P>
   And in Nags Head, N.C., his face peppered by stinging rain and
sand, Jeff Morrow of the Weather Channel stood before heaving waves
and warned of worse to come as his cameraman wiped water off the
lens with a rag.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so dramatic here on the southern East Coast,
as television crews from around the dial tracked Bonnie's fury _ or
lack of _ over the past two days. Aerial views on some channels
showed the same damaged house over and over and the same overturned
tree was brought to America's attention again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But, from networks like CNN and the Weather Channel, whose
viewership often rises significantly in times of crisis, to local
stations who dispatched dozens of reporters to stand at the water's
edge and give stern warnings of a catastrophe that never came, one
thing was clear:
</P>
<P>
   The only way to cover weather is to stand in it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the best way, forecasters say, to impress upon viewers the
importance and danger of what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell it like it is,'' said Cantore, who has loved the
science of weather since he was a boy in New England, jumping in
rain puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the camera's eye shows people the rushing
surf, the waving trees, the downed power lines, all the things that
could kill.
</P>
<P>
   It tells people why it is important to leave when a sheriff's
deputy knocks on the door and informs them of a ``mandatory
evacuation,'' something many homeowners and even tourists ignore,
forecaster said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``stand-up'' in gale-force winds has another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to stay with the program than go to the
clicker,'' if they see someone out in it, someone apparently
braving the elements, said Jack Loftus, vice president of
communications for Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to communicate it from the safety of studio,
but it's another to put it on the line, to put yourself in harm's
way,'' he said. ``It gets pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1.5 million households had tuned into the Weather
Channel as the storm bore down on the North Carolina coast. The
Weather Channel's average audience, in good weather, is about
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Cantore's presence here in harm's way on the southern
East Coast, not the calibrations and prognostications at the home
office of the Weather Channel back in Marietta, Ga., that holds the
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters from CNN, the Weather Channel and other networks
said they would not place one of their reporters in peril for a
live shot, and stressed that reporters more often set up their
camera's far from the coastline, usually across barrier islands,
when high winds threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never put them in harm's way,'' said Connie Malko, a
senior publicist for the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers do have at least the impression that the reporter is
going someplace that they would probably not go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's serious stuff,'' Loftus said of the live broadcasts,
``when you see somebody out there, right on the beach or boardwalk.
That does rivet your attention, partly because you want to see if
he gets blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantore said it negated the credibility of the newscast to take
foolish chances, or hype a weather system that had become less
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as he did his stand-up as Hurricane Bonnie faded from
hurricane to tropical storm, he picked a place where the wind blew
in off an inlet and contained no flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   There are always some risks, he said, but the secret is to avoid
foolish ones, while still being close enough to the storm's eye to
convey its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remove myself from the protection of the live
truck,'' he said Thursday morning, taking the viewer with him out
into the 60-mph gusts as the storm finally began to weaken.
``That's a pretty good gust right there,'' he said, leaning into
the wind, only wobbling a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about 60,'' he said, and it is no wild guess. Cantore
is a trained meteorologist, what he calls a field meteorologist,
and this week, he has been on more television sets than Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His Weather Channel has become the hot ticket item on the
Weather Service web page, where people can order Weather Channel
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with weather,'' said Cantore, who has had only
a few hours' sleep over the past week. For lunch on Thursday, he
had an orange, Milano cookies and Frosted Mini Wheats, covered in
Cheese Whiz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a big kid who loves to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But he understands how dangerous weather is. He tells the story
of how he once watched floodwaters cover over his live truck as he
watched from a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Local television crews seemed determined to emulate the networks
in their coverage, by sending people in rain gear out to the
beaches _ even though it looked a little silly as people in shorts
and T-shirts frolicked in the light rain around them.

AMOCO SUED OVER BRAIN TUMORS IN WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill. Ala., Md.)  (jw) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Over several decades, 19 current or former employees
of an Amoco Corp. research center in the Chicago suburbs have been
stricken with brain tumors and four of them have died. Nobody knows
why, and researchers hired by Amoco have been trying to figure out
whether the cases have a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   This week, four former employees and the surviving relatives of
three others filed suit against Amoco, saying it ``exhibited
reckless disregard for the health and well-being'' of the
employees. The suit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, charges
that Amoco exposed the employees in its Naperville research center
to ``defective, unsafe and/or unreasonably dangerous chemicals''
and that the company failed to take adequate measures to protect
its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 19 employees were stricken with an especially
deadly type of brain tumor, called a glioma. And all seven worked
on similar chemical research projects over the last 28 years. So
researchers have said they are paying close attention to about 34
research projects out of the tens of thousands the center has
worked on.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dean, a spokesman for Amoco, said the corporation had been
investigating the cancer cases since 1989. Last summer, Amoco asked
research teams from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to study the medical
histories of all 8,000 people who have ever worked at the center.
</P>
<P>
   In April, researchers outlined some of their findings. One
conclusion was that the seven men with glioma all worked at one
time or another in the same three-building complex at the center.
Five of those men worked in one of the complex's buildings, number
503, most worked on the third floor and three worked in a
laboratory housed in a wing of the building that is now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wells, Amoco's manager of epidemiology, told The Chicago
Tribune in April that because so many of the cases occurred in
people who worked in a small area, the number of glioma cases was
``about seven times higher than what you'd expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said Thursday that he could not comment on the lawsuit. But
he said: ``We're going to continue to aggressively investigate and
leave no stone unturned. Our primary concern remains the health and
well-being of our current and former colleagues. Our mission
remains to ensure a safe work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Hawes, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said she
hoped to expand the case into a class-action lawsuit. Ms. Hawes
said three of her clients had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are still alive,'' she added, ``but their
situation is not good.''

TCU NIXES SERIES WITH NEBRASKA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU has withdrawn from its three-game series
against perennial football power Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts _ agreed upon by former TCU athletic director
Frank Windegger and Nebraska athletic director Bill Byrne _ would
have had the Frogs traveling to Lincoln, Neb., in 2000, the
Cornhuskers coming to Fort Worth in 2001 and the game returning to
Lincoln in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, 1-10 last season, avoided a $100,000 forfeit fee by
agreeing to play the Cornhuskers once sometime in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie North, TCU director of football operations, said
yesterday that withdrawing from the games should not be viewed as a
TCU inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way are we scared of people,'' North said. ``We just
want to have a chance to keep our kids healthy and play out the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   North said no agreement has been made for replacement games but
said a deal could possibly be in the works for a three-game series
against Arkansas State, which was 2-9 last year.
</P>
<P>
   TCU athletic director Eric Hyman could not be reached for
comment yesterday. Byrne, having dealt with several programs that
pulled out of contracts in recent years, is not pleased with TCU's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand when a team is down; schools such as TCU need
some relief,'' Byrne said. ``But, on the other hand, when teams get
new athletic directors and football coaches, deals go sideways. And
I'm getting tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevada-Las Vegas, Utah State and Houston are among teams that
have withdrawn from games with Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   TCU would have received $400,000 for the game in Lincoln and
almost certainly would have had a capacity crowd for the game in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for the third game was never signed but would have
been played during the third week of the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If TCU is as bad as they say they are, then we don't want a
mismatch either,'' Byrne said. ``We'd rather for it to be more
competitive.''

MICKELSON TAKES CROOKED PATH TO LATE-SEASON SUCCESS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Phil Mickelson knows how to bounce back from
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   When Mickelson tied for 34th at the PGA Championship last month,
it meant another year passed without him winning a major
championship. That left Mickelson with two options: either he could
sulk until 1999, or he could spend the rest of the year proving he
is still one of the world's top golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson chose the latter. The day after the PGA ended,
Mickelson won the bizarre AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a
tournament that finally ended Aug. 17 after being postponed for
more than six months. Then Mickelson almost won again on Sunday,
finishing tied for second at the Sprint International.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Mickelson continued his torrid stretch at the NEC
World Series of Golf. Shooting an opening-round four-under par 66,
Mickelson held a one-stroke lead over Tiger Woods and Craig Parry
at the challenging Firestone Country Club South course.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how quickly things change. Mickelson was struggling only a
few weeks ago, and after this weekend he was planning to take two
months off. But following Thursday's round, Mickelson said he might
put his vacation on hold. Who could blame him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed after the third round of the PGA,
but Pebble gave me some momentum, and it carried over,'' Mickelson
said, after a round that featured six birdies and two bogeys. ``At
Pebble, I really started to hit the ball well and feel comfortable,
hitting the ball solid, better balance, just my swing over all. I'm
looking at this tournament as being big for my year. If I play
well, I'm going to add some tournaments and see what I can do about
finishing on top of the money list. If not, I'm going to take some
time off. It's really a big swing tournament for me on which way
the next couple of months are going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is sixth on the year's PGA Tour money list
($1,512,646), but winning this weekend's first-place check of
$405,000 could move Mickelson to No. 1, a position currently held
by Vijay Singh ($1,694,253), who shot an opening-round 71.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's round will only boost Mickelson's
confidence in a tournament where he usually plays well. Mickelson
won the NEC World Series of Golf in 1996, he finished second last
year and he finished fourth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One of the longest layouts on the tour (7,139 yards), Firestone
Country Club is a place where Mickelson can display his power off
the tee and his creative touch around the green. The highlights of
Mickelson's round included a birdie-birdie-birdie streak on Nos. 11
through 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about Firestone is that it's difficult for
players to separate themselves from the field,'' Mickelson said.
``You can be patient and not worry about guys shooting eight or
nine under par.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday ended with Woods and Parry in close pursuit of
Mickelson, while five players were tied for fourth place at 68 _
Justin Leonard, Tim Herron, Greg Turner, Brian Watts, and Shinichi
Yokota. It was a bogey-free day for Woods, who made three birdies
and punctuated his round with a birdie on No. 18, hitting a
gorgeous 9-iron approach shot to within two feet of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 top-10 finishes on tour this year, but only one victory,
Woods figured he may be due to break through. ``You've just got to
keep giving yourself chances,'' said Woods. ``This year,
unfortunately either someone has outplayed me, or I haven't made
the shots when I really needed them. With nine holes to go, you've
got to give yourself the chance. That's all I look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Parry, a 32-year-old veteran from Australia, Thursday's
round was welcome. Parry has not played up to his usual standards
this year, and although he switched putters recently, he was not
sure the change would solve his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the putter,'' Parry said. ``It was the idiot on the
end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With 13 career victories on tour, Mickelson, 28, has enjoyed
plenty of highlights, but the lack of a major championship is the
one glaring omission on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson admits he thought he would have won a major by now,
but his best finish at a major this year was a 10th place tie at
the United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mickelson, there is nothing he can do about
the majors until next year's Masters. But with a victory this
weekend, Mickelson could become the first three-time winner on tour
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played well the last three years here, so I have
confidence,'' Mickelson said. ``I'm looking at this tournament as
an opportunity.''

NOVARTIS, PROFIT UP 14 PERCENT, WILL SHED SOME FOOD LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out to gain some market momentum, Novartis AG of Switzerland,
the world's largest health care company, reported a 14 percent gain
in first-half earnings Thursday and announced a plan to unload
several slow-selling nutritional brands and combine its nutrition
and over-the-counter drug divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to a jump in investment income, Novartis'
earnings in the first half rose to 3.553 billion Swiss francs, or
$2.4 billion, from 3.117 billion francs a year earlier. Operating
profit was up only 2 percent, to 4.1 billion francs, because of
higher marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Novartis earnings met most analysts' expectations,
its stock ended lower on a day of deep market losses worldwide. The
shares fell 66 Swiss francs in Zurich, or 2.7 percent. On the New
York Stock Exchange, Novartis' U.S. depository receipts, which
represent one-twentieth of a share, fell $2.50, to $77. By
comparison, the shares of Schering-Plough fell $4.8125, to
$97.0625; Pfizer lost $4.125, to $103.875; and Merck was down
$4.25, at $129.125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long expected Novartis to pare some of its
disparate brands. Created from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz
in 1996, Novartis, based in Basel, makes everything from Neoral, a
blockbuster transplant drug, to such cupboard staples as Ovaltine,
Ex-Lax, Sunkist products and Gerber baby and junior foods.
</P>
<P>
   The realignment will allow Novartis to eliminate 380 jobs,
mostly administrative positions in Europe, and parcel off seven
units, including Roland snacks, Wasa crisp bread and Redline, a
U.S. distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Vasella, the company's president, said in an
interview Thursday that the brands would probably be sold
separately and that the steps were unlikely to be completed before
year-end. ``We'll create some synergies and get a clearer focus on
the marketplace,'' Vasella said. ``The brands that are being
divested had relatively little in common with some of our other
brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Novartis plans to dispense with some food items, the
company appears to be following a strategy some of its competitors
are abandoning. Aside from food, Novartis is a giant seller of
pharmaceuticals and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Few drug companies have remained leaders in all three, choosing
instead to shed one of them to divert more money into research and
development for new drugs. Once the American Home Products
acquisition of Monsanto is completed, the combined company would be
comparable to Novartis in pharmaceuticals and agricultural
products. Yet, American Home Products sold many of its food brands
well before the acquisition was announced.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Novartis has failed to stir the enthusiasm
among investors that some of its U.S. competitors _ like Pfizer,
with its introduction of Viagra, or Warner-Lambert, red-hot from
the sales of Lipitor and Rezulin _ have.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Vasella to sell Gerber as a way to focus
more on pharmaceuticals. But that option does not sit well with the
Novartis boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want to do something like that?'' he asked. ``We
looked at what was our strongest brand in nutrition, and it's
Gerber. It's one of the top brands in the U.S., sort of in the
class as Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Novartis said it would take a charge of about 120 million
francs, or $81 million, this year to revamp its nutrition division.

GIANTS TIGHTEN WILD-CARD RACE IN A BLOWOUT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bobby Valentine found himself in a quandary at
3Com Park Thursday. His starter for the Mets, Armando Reynoso, had
made 27 pitches in the first inning and 28 pitches in the second,
and he had pitched out of serious jams both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always pitches like that,'' Valentine later said of
Reynoso, who entered the game against San Francisco with a 5-0
record in five starts this year. ``You have to give him some rope
because that's the way he pitches. You start taking him out of the
game, he'll never be able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So the manager stayed with Reynoso, though he had Willie Blair
warming up in the third. But Reynoso could never shake his funk.
The 32-year-old right-hander allowed three runs in a 29-pitch third
inning and was charged with four more runs when he could not escape
a two-out jam in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McMichael and Mel Rojas contributed some kindling to the
fire, too, as the Giants buried the Mets, 11-3, and pulled within a
game of New York, which leads the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the fourth in the last five games for the Mets
(73-61), who could fall into a tie with Chicago for the wild-card
lead, pending the Cubs' outcome in Colorado Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso conceded he did not have command of his best pitch, his
cut fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in trouble every inning,'' said Reynoso, who left the
bases loaded in the first. ``I got out of it in the first. Later, I
couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four and two-thirds innings, Reynoso allowed 10 hits and
7 runs, walking 5 and striking out 4, while mostly pitching behind
in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't get any strikes called,'' Valentine said. ``He was
forced back into the plate. And when he threw it over, they got
some hits. There were just too many balls. But he was probably due
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager added: ``When he pitches, he pitches to both sides
of the plate. And when he doesn't get strikes called, it's not
necessary to swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso ended up throwing 117 pitches, 48 of them for balls. By
comparison, the 42-year-old Danny Darwin threw 77 pitches in five
and two-thirds innings, which was one more inning than Reynoso
pitched. For his entire outing, Darwin (8-10) threw only three more
pitches than Reynoso did over his first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin also collected a pair of singles off Reynoso, the third
and fifth innings, to double his season total to four. Darwin was
hitting only .048 (2 for 42) before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Darwin joked that he had been told earlier in the
season that he should wear glasses at the plate. When asked what
kind of vision he had, Darwin, the third-oldest player in the
majors, said, ``About 0/36.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still had visions of winning the game after Darwin's
bases-loaded single in the third had given San Francisco a 3-0 lead
instead of a 4-0 lead because Lenny Harris threw out Ellis Burks at
the plate to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth
against Darwin, on singles by Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza
sandwiched around a John Olerud walk.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian McRae, celebrating his 30th birthday with the
distinction of being the fifth-toughest National League player to
double up this season (1 for every 150.7 at-bats), grounded to
second and into a double play. When Carlos Baerga grounded hard
back to Darwin, it was still 3-1 Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about the only way I hit into double plays, hard and
right at someone,'' said McRae, who grounded into only his fourth
one of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' failure to muster more than one run from the threat
was magnified when Reynoso surrendered a one-out homer to Burks in
the fifth, before allowing two-out singles to Rey Sanchez and
Darwin (an infield hit to short). Marvin Benard followed with a
run-scoring single to left. Out went Reynoso and on came came
McMichael, who yielded a two-run double to Bill Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, San Francisco led, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, after the Mets had pulled within 7-3 on
Piazza's 25th homer of the season, McMichael allowed a two-out,
three-run pinch-homer to Shawon Dunston, who celebrated with his
son, Shawon Jr., in the Giants' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Jr. was the team's honorary bat boy and tending to chores
when his father homered. He slapped hands with several Giants and
then headed on the field to gleefully jump into his father's arms.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deadly commuter-plane crash near Detroit last
year could probably have been prevented if the Federal Aviation
Administration had put into effect the lessons learned from a
similar crash two year earlier, Federal safety officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, of the National Transportation Safety Board, also
criticized the agency for certifying turboprop planes like the one
involved in the Detroit crash as safe for flying into ice, saying
the FAA does not know enough to make the determination.
</P>
<P>
   The board also called for new testing on all turboprop models in
service to determine whether they were safe to fly in such
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   New de-icing procedures developed by the manufacturer of the
Comair EMB-120 that crashed near Detroit on Jan. 9, 1997, killing
all 29 people aboard, could have prevented the ice buildup that
caused the plane to nosedive, the safety board said. Officials of
the board harshly criticized the agency for not ordering the
procedures, which were developed after a turboprop crash in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we see an accident like this repeating itself, on
information we should have already learned, its an indictment of
the whole system,'' said James Hall, chairman of the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board also called for a campaign to educate pilots on
new strategies for flying through icy conditions. Many new
strategies were developed after the 1994 crash, in Roselawn, Ind.,
of an ATR-72 owned by an American Airlines affiliate, American
Eagle. Sixty-eight died in that accident. The board said those
lessons were not used by most other airlines, including Comair,
which flies as the Delta Connection.
</P>
<P>
   If icing was dealt with aggressively, Hall said, ``hopefully we
can eliminate it as a factor in future accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how well the FAA regulates aviation safety, Hall
said, ``We aren't getting what we're paying for.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is an independent, advisory agency; the FAA
regulates pilots, airlines and aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The response from the FAA, apparently resigned to taking one of
the most severe public beatings of the last few years, was terse.
Eliot Brenner, the assistant administrator for public affairs,
said, ``We got the recommendations, and we're looking at the
process issues raised by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said that Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, was
``tied up on other issues'' and was not available to answer
questions about the Safety Board's criticisms. But, he said, ``she
has been very closely following this.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also distributed a chronology of actions it has taken
since the second crash.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem identified by the Safety Board Thursday was that
Embraer, which builds the EMB-120, had developed a new procedure
that probably would have prevented the accident, but while one
branch of the FAA had approved the plan, that information did not
get to the branch that would have made it a requirement for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure, to regularly inflate a hard-rubber.
balloon-like boot on the wing whenever the plane is in icing
conditions, was developed as a result of the Roselawn crash. Before
that crash, rules required pilots to inflate the de-icing boot only
after ice had formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all of the investment, after all of the tragedy of
Roselawn, to have information that was generated not make it into
the cockpit is something we never want to see happen again,'' said
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Detroit crash the FAA had been studying six incidents
in which EMB-120s had lost control; there has been at least once
since then.
</P>
<P>
   The board said Thursday that ``despite the accumulated lessons
of several major accidents,'' the FAA's posture on the risks posed
by ice had remained ``incremental and reactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Turboprops are not as safe as jets, primarily because of
susceptibility to ice, top officials of the safety board said
Thursday There are 1,500 such planes in passenger service, carrying
about 54 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ice on a wing can cause a plane to lose lift and lead to a
crash, investigators said. The Comair plane accumulated ``sandpaper
ice'' on its wings, rough enough to disrupt the airflow and cut
lift very sharply. But the sandpaper ice may be so thin that it is
difficult to see from the cockpit, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of rough ice has been known since the 1930s, and
investigators from the safety board found in the FAA's files a
draft memorandum, dated one year before the Detroit crash, noting
that EMB-120s used by airlines tended to develop control problems
from coats of ice so thin that their crews did not realize there
was a risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the tests used to approve the design of the plane are for
thick ice accumulation, not sandpaper ice, on the theory that if
planes can handle thick ice they can handle anything smaller. This
may be wrong, engineers from the safety board said. And by writing
standards that do not include testing for sandpaper ice, ``It does
not cover something that you may encounter in normal flight,'' said
Bernard Loeb, director of the office of aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all turboprops have a ``pneumatic boot'' system to
counter ice build-up, but at the time of the crash, pilots at five
of the seven airlines flying them were trained not to use it until
thick ice was visible, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The boots are thick rubber balloons on the forward edges of the
wings that alternately inflate and deflate to break off accumulated
ice. Common wisdom among airlines and FAA regulators is that pilots
should not turn the system on until visible ice has developed, for
fear of letting ice build up in a bulge on top of the inflated
boots, in which case the boots would inflate and deflate within
little ice pockets, without breaking the ice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the safety board said that this belief was obsolete, because
such an effect is not possible on modern aircraft. After the
Roselawn crash, Embraer amended the aircraft manual to call for
turning the system on whenever ice was suspected. In the plane that
crashed, the pilots had already turned on a system to heat the
propellers and the windshield, as called for in company procedures,
in anticipation of ice.
</P>
<P>
   The change was approved by the FAA's office of aircraft
certification. But the certification office never told the office
that regulates airplane operations. Loeb said that the FAA had told
investigators from the board that there was no requirement for
information to be passed between the two branches.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer told Comair and Comair sent a memorandum to pilots about
a month before the accident mentioning the advice. But the airline
did not make it a rule for pilots. A spokeswoman for the airline,
Meghan Glynn said Thursday that the airline would have no comment
until it had a chance to read the board's report.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said that under the system now in use, airlines have the
final say on such advice. ``The operator can choose to do what we
wants to with it,'' he said, ``the idea being, you build them, we
fly them, and we know how to fly them better than you because we do
it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Goglia, a member of the safety board, complained, ``not to
pass that kind of information on to people, who are operating these
airplanes in these conditions on almost a daily basis, is
unconscionable.'' The board wants the airlines to either adopt the
manufacturers' procedures or demonstrate why they should not.

   ECONOMIC WOES IN RUSSIA SEND GLOBAL MARKETS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Investors around the world sold stocks Thursday. In this
country, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.19 percent, to
8,165.99, a loss of 357.36 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index dropped 4.62 percent, or 81.72 points, to 1,686.41,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.81 percent, or
41.60 points, to 1,042.59. With the Dow average now 12.5 percent
below its July 17 high of 9,337.97, investors are into what Wall
Street calls a correction.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff began in Japan, where the Nikkei index of 225 stocks
declined 3.04 percent. In Europe, key indexes fell 3 percent to 6
percent, with the DAX index in Germany dropping 4.48 percent.
Mexico's main stock index fell 6 percent and Brazil's 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in the ruble has hit Russians hard, pushing up prices.
A woman counts her money as she buys food at a Moscow market. As
the economic crisis deepens, pressure has mounted on the Russian
President, Boris Yeltsin, to cede some of his powers or even step
aside as that country's political leaders negotiated over
fundamental changes in economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Republic New York, considered one of the nation's most
conservatively managed banks, said its losses in Russia would wipe
out all of its third-quarter earnings. It plans to take a $110
million pretax charge in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   CBS TO SPIN OFF RADIO AND AD UNIT
</P>
<P>
   CBS Corp. said it would spin off up to 20 percent of its radio
and outdoor advertising businesses in a public offering. Shares of
CBS rose $2.0625, to $29.25, on the news.
</P>
<P>
   CHANCELLOR MEDIA ACQUIRING CAPSTAR
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Media announced plans to buy Capstar Broadcasting for
$2.3 billion in stock plus nearly $1.8 billion in assumed debt,
surpassing CBS as the nation's largest chain of radio stations. The
combined company will have 463 stations.
</P>
<P>
   ISIS SHARES RISE ON FDA APPROVAL
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 56.25 cents, to $9.8125,
after the Food and Drug Administration approved its drug,
fomivirsen, for treatment of CMV retinitis, a virus that often
causes blindness in AIDS patients. Fomivirsen will be made by Isis
and marketed as Vitravene by Ciba Vision.
</P>
<P>
   NOVARTIS PROFITS INCREASE 14%
</P>
<P>
   Novartis of Switzerland reported a 14 percent gain in first-half
earnings and announced a plan to sell several nutritional brands
and combine its nutrition and over-the-counter drug divisions.
</P>
<P>
   GROWTH SURPASSES ESTIMATE
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than
previously estimated. The Commerce Department said gross domestic
product rose at a revised 1.6 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, higher than the initial estimate of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA RAISES MAIN INTEREST RATE
</P>
<P>
   Canada's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a
full percentage point in an effort to halt the slide of the
Canadian dollar, which has fallen more than 10 percent against the
United States dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA OFFICIALLY IN RECESSION
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter,
confirming that the country had fallen into recession. Its central
bank reported that the gross domestic product shrank 6.8 percent in
the second quarter as Asian turmoil led to heavy stock sales and
soaring interest rates.

UNFORTUNATELY FOR RANGERS, ANGELS NOT FOLLOWING SCRIPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Texas Rangers cleaned out their diapers and bid good
riddance to the mighty Yankees on Sunday, a lady near the New
Yorkers' dugout waved what was supposed to be a prophetic sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee Go Home,'' it read. ``And beat the Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the script was supposed to read, was it not?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had taken their pinstriped medicine, and now it was
Anaheim's turn to open wide. One week into their tiptoe on the
rough side of the American League tracks, the Rangers had been
mugged in the Bronx and readily surrendered first place.
</P>
<P>
   No worries. The Angels, it was roundly presumed, would soon get
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   So, here the team was in hallowed Yankee Stadium on Wednesday _
fretting, doubting, calling a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Except it was the Yankees, not the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grinders,'' Angels reliever Troy Percival had told
reporters the night before. ``We're going to battle you to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happened last night, the Angels were assured of
winning the season series from the seemingly record-bound Yanks.
More than that, they were sounding energized, not assaulted and
batteried, by their New York experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even after losing the night end of Wednesday's doubleheader,
Angels manager Terry Collins announced, ``We battled our butts off.
We're going to leave the park tonight feeling great.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that, if you will, to the clenched-throat,
white-knuckled evening the Rangers were experiencing against the
Detroit Tigers. No ground was recouped during the three-game
series. In the end, there was the human lifeboat, John Wetteland,
paddling in to rescue yet another day.
</P>
<P>
   You can compare the lineup cards, if you must. You can argue
whether Darin Erstad is worth more at first base than Will Clark.
You can wonder aloud how flutterballer Steve Sparks could go 0-8 in
the minor leagues, and yet 8-2 for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it says here, the Rangers are better.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels are tougher. Hungrier. They are, like Percival
said, grinders and battlers.
</P>
<P>
   If they win this American League West race, as they now might,
it'll be because they fought for it harder. The Angels clearly
believe in themselves. The Rangers, on the other hand, seem to look
in the mirror and don't know what to think.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are prolonging innings with costly errors. They are
taking anxious cuts when the situation calls for practicing
patience. They are making stupid base-running mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   They don't deserve to be in first place anymore. Last weekend's
five-error spectacle was a glaring symptom.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, on the other hand, have not been letting ground
balls ripple through their legs and squandering nightly leads. In
their five-game winning streak that ended Wednesday, Anaheim came
from behind in all five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a bunch of rats,'' Erstad told writers in New York.
``We just keep grinding at you.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't how the script was supposed to go at all.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jack McDowell wasn't supposed to come out of four months
on the injured list and give the Angels two dominating starts. Todd
Greene, whose catching career was said to be over, wasn't supposed
to arrive and hit .300 over the final two months.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Tuesday, a 32-year-old rookie named Reggie Williams,
called up after 11 years in the minors, turned the game around for
the Angels with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there is pitcher Jeff Juden, renowned loose cannon and
under-achiever, who was the Angels' meek answer to the flurry of
deadline deals that the Rangers pulled off. Against the Yankees
Wednesday, Juden went six-plus innings and held the Yankees to only
three hits.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for some cash and a player to be named later to
Milwaukee, the Angels have already gotten more from Juden than the
Rangers have from Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The script lies.
</P>
<P>
   With the combative Collins in charge and with coaches like Larry
Bowa, the Angels are not a placid group. New third baseman Troy
Glaus brought a steel-jawed reputation with him. He once got
knocked cold by a pitch in college. When the Yankees knocked him
down the other night, Glaus got up from the dirt and cracked a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great leaders,'' Collins said. He clicked off the
names of Erstad, Gary DiSarcina, Tim Salmon and Randy Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are is a testament to the character of the DiSarcinas,
the Salmons and Erstads,'' Collins told the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of guys who care about numbers,'' Erstad
chimed in. ``We just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, you could argue, it doesn't add up. On paper, the
Rangers have the best catcher, the best slugger, the best left
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Rangers seem unraveled at the challenge, the
Angels appear inspired.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the script.

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While global stock markets plunged, a major index of
commodity prices, on products from oil to cotton, fell to its
lowest level in 21 years Thursday. And that may be more worrisome
for investors in the long run than Thursday's 4.19 percent decline
in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Each tick down in the price of oil, copper, cotton and gold puts
more economic pressure on the nations where they are produced. And
many of the major producers are the emerging-market countries
experiencing deep financial crisis, like Russia, which is a leading
exporter of oil and precious metals, or countries considered
vulnerable, like Mexico, which is also a big oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Already, commodity prices have fallen 20 percent in the last
year and heightened concern about the economies and markets of
developing nations that began with Asian currency selloffs in the
second half of 1997. ``It's a flu, it's catching; it's dominoes,''
said William Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co. ``Not only is the psychology spreading, but the economic
weakness is spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's drop in commodities came as markets around the world
tumbled and Russia's economic crisis deepened. Millions of
investors, seeking to flee the turmoil, rushed to the relative
safety of U.S. Treasury securities, pushing long-term yields to
their lowest level in 30 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   For the American investor worried about the strength of the
economy, which by all current signs is still strong, and corporate
earnings, which have been weakening, so far the fall in commodity
prices and the drop in interest rates have been good news.
</P>
<P>
   The lower prices for commodities, while tough on emerging-market
and other producing nations, have lowered corporate costs here and
spurred consumer spending. And the damage that had been done to
commodity producers in the United States has not had a big impact
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in interest rates has also been positive for the
economy, by bolstering housing and capital investment. Thirty-year
mortgage rates have now been below 7 percent for more than two
months. Thursday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to
5.34 percent, the lowest for long-term yields in three decades. The
10-year note's yield, a benchmark for home mortgage rates, fell to
5.06 percent, its lowest since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   These forces have, so far, have more than offset the drag from
the Asian economic crisis, which has led to a sharp drop in demand
for American exports. And this is one reason the economy has slowed
much less than many economists expected in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   But with the global economic and market turmoil spreading from
Asia to Russia to Latin America, it appears less likely, some
analysts said, that the positives of lower interest rates and low
commodity prices would be sufficient to offset the drag from a
global economic slowdown on American corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Already, many economic forecasters who had bet on the offsetting
effect from lower commodity prices and lower interest rates have
been scaling back their economic forecasts for the second half of
the year. And a steep fall in U.S.  &QL; 
stock prices, which would dampen consumer spending, might force a
further scaling back, which would not be good for corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you correct the problems'' in Asia and Russia, said
Richard Berner, chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, ``the
stimulus will be a minor offset.''
</P>
<P>
   The backwash from the Russian turmoil pushed the Commodity
Research Bureau/Bridge Index of 17 commodities down 1.88 points
Thursday, to 196.24, the lowest since December 1977, a year of
sharp declines in agricultural prices that led to farmer protests.
</P>
<P>
   The impact from the commodity price decline has gone beyond the
emerging economies. In Canada, a major commodity producer, the
currency dropped to another record low, forcing the central bank to
raise its benchmark interest rate a full percentage point, to 6
percent. The increase also helped send the Toronto Stock Exchange
index down more than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two forces have been pushing commodity prices lower and will
continue to do so, several analysts said Thursday. One is the
falling demand from Asian nations, which, for example, were major
consumers of copper for new construction. The other is that
countries in deep trouble, like Russia, are expected to sell what
they can to raise money, adding to the supply in an already weak
market.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch,
said there had been big sales of platinum and palladium by Russia
in Japan and sales of gold and silver in Zurich and London. The
crisis, he said, ``inspires them to sell as much as possible.'' The
government controls much of the country's precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   The selling by Russia had an odd twist. Gold had been thought of
for years as refuge in the time of political and economic crises,
and a few gold bugs still hold that belief. But Thursday, the price
of gold plunged, dropping to a 19-year low on the spot market in
London at $276.55 an ounce, down $5.70.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity selling is also coming from countries like Australia
whose currency also fell to a record low Thursday. But because most
commodities are priced in dollars, the weaker Australian dollar
means that gold and other commodity sellers can reap nice profits
when the sales are translated back into Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This all means that commodity prices _ and the pain that they
are bringing to already troubled economies _ still have a way to go
before they hit bottom. ``I don't think we are there yet,'' Berner
of Mellon Bank said.

EX-COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT'S SUSPECT ALLIES EYE ASYLUM IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ As a court investigation opens into a 1996
decision by Congress to clear the president at the time, Ernesto
Samper, of criminal charges, a group that championed him in
Congress is trying to obtain asylum in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings over several weeks, 17 senators and deputies, led by
Martha Catalina Daniels, mapped a plan to request asylum in
Germany, Britain, France and Italy on the ground of political
persecution. None of the countries have extradition treaties with
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Daniels left for Germany with her two youngest children
last week after reportedly bidding farewell to her husband,
Hernando Rodriguez, in a room at a police training center that has
been turned into a jail for public officials gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez landed in jail after stealing $10 million when he was
in charge of privatizing Colpuertos, a public riverport
administration.
</P>
<P>
   On her way out, the newspaper El Tiempo reported, Mrs. Daniels
gave farewell hugs to jailed friends: former Congressman Rodrigo
Garavito and David Turbay and Rodolfo Gonzalez, two of six former
Colombian comptrollers who have landed in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Samper's supporters had been more accustomed to diplomatic
postings for family and friends, control over patronage jobs and
government largesse in their districts. Their troubles began when
the court made its decision days after Andres Pastrana won the
presidency June 21; he took office Aug. 21. It was Pastrana who had
made public taped conversations of Samper's 1994 campaign
soliciting contributions from drug chiefs in exchange for promises
of lenient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after a large majority of Congress voted to clear
Samper of charges that Cali drug dealers had bankrolled his
election, the Supreme Court said it would determine whether
deputies had ignored ``overwhelming evidence'' of his guilt, and
whether any of them profited from the decision. If found guilty,
their sentences could range from six months to eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samper, the public budget and patronage machine was openly
used to dole out favors to figures who could keep him in office,
along with their family and friends. Heyne Mogollon, a deputy whose
Committee of Accusations decided against allowing all the evidence
against the president to go before the full Congress, found that a
new road had been built clear to his home in Cordoba.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have been meeting to plan a counterattack.
Sen. Carlos Alonso Lucio, a former deputy who has publicly
supported measures to benefit drug traffickers in Congress, was
designated to pitch the group's case before Amnesty International
and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, El Tiempo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview Thursday, Alonso said he had not yet
determined whether to seek refuge in Europe, but would most likely
decide as he saw the course of the investigation. ``It's a possible
answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Parejo, a former justice minister who brought one of
several public complaints that prompted the court's investigation,
confessed that he was surprised at the decision to take up the case
after such a long period and at the idea of Samper's supporters
seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said the former minister, who survived an
assassination attempt by Medellin drug dealers in the late 1980s.
``They're doing the same thing they did under Samper: using the
laws to help themselves and erode the image of Colombia.''

 &HT;    Chipper Jones' recovery puts club in bind
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis _ The Braves made their phone call to Richmond
Thursday. Turned out to be a wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   The club recalled third baseman Wes Helms from its Class AAA
affiliate, only to find the regular third baseman actually wasn't
really hurt. Chipper Jones, who trudged off the field in Houston
the night before with what as described a muscle pull in the right
rib cage, found he could swing without pain during batting practice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how to explain it,'' said trainer Dave Pursley,
who said Jones' only treatment had been ice. ''I won't try.''
</P>
<P>
   This was less amusing to manager Bobby Cox. After the team
placed outfielder Danny Bautista on the 15-day disabled list with a
slight tear of the medial colateral ligament in his right knee to
call up Helms, the club finds itself one outfielder short and has
one second baseman (Keith Lockhart) with a stubborn right hamstring
strain. But it is fully equipped with two healthy third basemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''My plans were that Chipper wasn't going to be available for a
while,'' said Cox. ''I was going to call (Helms) up anyway to give
Chipper a breather here and there. He's going to play some.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain Jones' recovery, Cox suggested, ''Maybe it was
gas?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones arrived early at Busch Stadium, not knowing what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did a little soft toss and I didn't feel that pain that I
was feeling yesterday,'' he said. ''I don't know what it was. Maybe
it was just a bad day. But it certainly feels a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms was a late arrival at the park, his flight landing right
at gametime. In his fifth year with the organization, he was
hitting .275 in his first full AAA season with 13 homers and 75
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista's diagnosis came after a Wednesday MRI detected what
was apparently an old injury that flared up after his collision
with Los Angeles' Tom Prince Monday. Pursley said two weeks off
should be enough to get him back on the field, though his ''loose''
knee joint will not be right without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Now at second
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his tour of the infield, Ozzie Guillen was a guest
starter at second base Thursday, giving the club a left-handed bat
against Cardinals starter Matt Morris while Lockhart sat out his
fifth game with a tender hamstring. The experience was Guillen's
first as a second baseman, coming one night after his first-ever
full game as a third baseman, filling in for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now (Andres) Galarraga is going to serve his suspension and
they're going to say, 'Guillen, go in and play first,' '' he said.
''But we got a couple guys right now who are sore. They need some
days off. That's what I'm here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday review
</P>
<P>
   A third dosing of cortisone, this one in his right shoulder, had
a premium effect on John Smoltz's 6-2 win in Houston, leaving the
right-hander feeling as well as he has after a start all year.
Smoltz received an injection last Saturday, when he doubted he
could make his next scheduled start. He was also able to warm up
easier after a 10-minute jolt of electro-stimulation on his elbow.
Not only did he win his eighth straight but limited the Astros to
an earned run, his lowest allotment in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I actually feel like I didn't fight a war like every time I
pitch,'' said Smoltz. ''That's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's sixth ejection of the season, coming Wednesday night
courtesy of first base umpire Bill Hohn, should come with an
asterisk. Cox became the third ejection for Hohn in four days.
Nevertheless, Cox is just one short of his 1997 ejection total,
which led the league.

 &HT;    On Deck: St. Louis Cardinals
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (17-6, 1.91; 17-14,
2.39 lifetime vs. Cardinals) vs. LHP Kent Mercker (8-11, 5.57; 1-2,
5.04 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: When the Braves traded Mercker on Dec. 17, 1995, for the
since departed Joe Borowski and Rachaad Stewart, he was coming off
a 7-8 season, his worst as a Brave. In more than five years of
service with the Braves, Mercker had gone 31-25 with a 3.49 ERA.
Now with his fourth club in three years, Mercker has gone 20-28
since, with a 5.17 ERA. Even so, he faces the Braves as the
winningest pitcher of the depleted Cardinals' staff with just eight
victories. He defeated the Braves for the first time in four tries
when he last faced them July 31, beating Greg Maddux 3-2. Maddux is
coming off one of the worst starts in his career: three homers and
seven earned runs allowed in five innings to Los Angeles on
Sunday). He is 5-4 in the second half and hasn't won consecutive
games since beating Toronto and Tampa Bay on June 27 and July 2.
For all that, he still can become the National League's first
18-game winner tonight. He is 10-6 lifetime at Busch Stadium.

 &HT;    Kuchar-Garcia showdown is set
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ After two days of cruising around Oak Hill
Country Club, chopping up opponents like some smiling Lawnmower
Man, Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar finally gets thrown into some
deeper rough today in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Amateur
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Two days early, it's the marquee matchup. U.S. Amateur champion
vs. British Amateur champion. Kuchar, 20, vs. Spain's Sergio
Garcia, 18, this morning at 10:15. Two players whose total age
still falls short of 41-year-old Danny Green, whom Garcia defeated
Thursday in the third round, 3 and 2, will provide a look at Ryder
Cup matches of the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blow it all out of proportion. While it's the match
that NBC began to script as soon as the brackets were published,
the winner won't necessarily be hoisting the USGA hardware Sunday
afternoon. Positioned in the other bracket is Kuchar's Tech
teammate, Bryce Molder, who also advanced to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big match,'' said Kuchar. ``It's the quarterfinals of
the U.S. Amateur. But I don't think I'm going to let down the
United States if I don't win and I don't think he's going to let
down Spain or Europe if he doesn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty special,'' Garcia said, ``because he's the
defending champion and probably the best (amateur) golfer in the
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The two players have met only once before in an official
match-play situation, but under abbreviated and much
less-meaningful conditions. Playing in the rain-shortened Terra
Cotta Invitational in Naples, Fla., last Thanksgiving, Kuchar beat
Garcia 1-up in a 9-hole match that neither player treats too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Molder, who plays in Kuchar's shadow but is every bit his equal,
advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4 and 3 win over Andy Miller,
son of NBC's Johnny Miller, and will face Hank Kuehne, a 3 and 1
winner over Tech's Mauricio Muniz.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta's Charles Howell, one of the favorites to make the
finals, tripped over UNLV's Bill Lunde Thursday, losing 2 and 1
because of an unfriendly putter. ``I would have been better,'' said
Howell, ``putting with my sand wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   With a tough opponent such as Garcia today,Kuchar might even get
a look at the rest of Oak Hill's superb back nine. In his three
matches thus far, Kuchar has required only 37 holes to close out
his foes. He has won 23 holes, lost only three and has not needed
to journey past the 13th hole. The Tech junior managed two 6-and-5
wins Thursday, ousting Matthew Saglio of Clearwater, Fla., in the
morning and Bert Atkinson, 40, of Charleston, S.C., in the
afternoon. Kuchar is clearly in championship form. Ever since
``something clicked'' on the driving range Sunday, he has been
striking the ball flawlessly and finding recovery shots when
needed. On the 10th hole of his first match he chipped in from 70
feet, demoralizing his opponent. Kuchar also holds a defending
champion's mental edge, fueled by the dominating play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger (Woods) might have had a little initimidation
advantage and I may have some of that working, too,'' Kuchar said.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Colbert's Jedd McLuen of the College of Charleston lost 3 and 2
to Tom McKnight of the University of Virginia. ... Florida
Southern's Andy McLendon lost to Lunde, 4 and 3.

 &HT;    Game may be DeBerg's last chance
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta Falcons quarterback Steve DeBerg knows
tonight's final preseason game against Cincinnati might be the last
time he lines up under center. But don't look for the old man to
sweat it, at least not before he stares across the line at the
Bengals' defense.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, 44, is trying to resume his career after retiring in
1993 with 17 years in the NFL. He already has lived the good life
in football, so he's not as concerned about his future as some of
the other players.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Falcons must cut seven players to get to the
NFL-mandated 53. The team has spent the past several days looking
at players cut from other teams, particularly quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the last time I ever take a snap in a game,''
said DeBerg, who began training camp competing with Tony Graziani
to be Chris Chandler's backup. ``I'm going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg is expected to play the second half. He and other Falcons
on the cut bubble are expected to get a good look from the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Corey Louchiey, for example, has to prove he's
worth his two-year, $3.5 million contract. He's battling to remain
the starter, a job that coach Dan Reeves said is Louchiey's to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Louchiey, 26, was in no mood to talk Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out and play Friday, and I'll leave it at
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, six-year veteran Todd Kinchen and four-year veteran
Keith Crawford appear to be finalists for one wide receiver spot.
Juran Bolden, rookie Elijah Williams, Lenny McGill and Randy Fuller
are competing for two, maybe only one, spot at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, a Columbus native who played the last three seasons with
the Steelers, signed a two-year, $1.25 million contract. But he
injured an ankle and missed 17 practices and three preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm around 85 percent,'' he said. ``It's something I can't
control. This is when teammates learn who they can go into battle
with, a crucial time. It's just unfortunate I've been hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said he has improved since a rough performance in the
Falcons' 7-3 victory at Detroit two weeks ago. He completed 6-of-11
passes for 39 yards but was slow afoot, slow to get rid of the ball
and didn't throw downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are starting to come back,'' he said. ``I'm throwing
the ball better; my recognition is faster than it was. I'm on
schedule. Pressure? I'm just going to enjoy it. People say you
should play every game as if it's your last; I'm living it.''

 &HT;    Looking for turnaround in turnover department
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- This is getting to be redundant, but when the Atlanta
Falcons play the Cincinnati Bengals tonight in their final
preseason game, they'll be looking for a first. The team has yet to
gain a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got 18 interceptions and recovered 11 opponents' fumbles
last season, but it's been a bone-dry preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are the only team in the NFL that hasn't gained a
turnover, a dubious distinction they've held for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They came close Saturday, when cornerback Michael Booker
appeared to intercept Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart at the Steeler
7-yard line. But Booker was called for holding the receiver, a
questionable call inasmuch as he was jamming the receiver within
the allowable five yards of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Falcons (1-2) have turned the ball over five
times, three times by interceptions, and twice by fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals (1-2) had three interceptions last week, as
defensive backs Ashley Ambrose, Corey Sawyer and Myron Bell had
picks in a 33-19 win over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a big-play defense against Detroit (including six
sacks), and that's what we have to be,'' said Cincinnati coach
Bruce Coslet. ``The biggest advantage we have over last year (when
the Bengals were 7-9) is our team speed is so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on Blake
</P>
<P>
   Falcon coaches will watch Bengals backup quarterback Jeff Blake,
whom the team might be interested in acquiring should he become
available this weekend. Blake lost the starting job to Neil
O'Donnell, and team officials are reluctant to pay his $1.95
million salary this year and $2.65 million salary next.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's agent is talking about renegotiating the player's
contract to one year, but Cincinnati officials are angling for two.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely way Atlanta might acquire the former East
Carolina standout is by signing him as a free agent if Cincinnati
releases him. The Bengals, though, are sure to try to get something
in a trade if they decide to jettison Blake at all. Although
interest in Blake is high (the Bears are said to be keenly
interested), many potential suitors will balk at his contract
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also will watch the waiver wire Sunday, when rosters
are reduced to 53 around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion time?
</P>
<P>
   Guard Doug Widell, released Tuesday by the Packers, is an
interesting player. The chances of the Falcons being interested are
slim, but it would be intriguing if he were to team up with brother
Dave, a Falcons backup center and guard.
</P>
<P>
   When the Widell brothers played together with Denver (under Dan
Reeves and Falcons general manager Harold Richardson) from
1990-'92, they were just the sixth sibling combination in NFL
history to play for the same team at the same time at the same
position (offensive line).
</P>
<P>
   Doug is one year younger than Dave, 33.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see Falcons rookie linebacker Keith Brooking, the
team's first-round draft choice, on the field with the first-team
nickel defense tonight. He also will perform on multiple special
teams. ... Falcons starters may play into the third quarter
tonight, same as the Bengals. ... After giving up five sacks last
week to the Steelers and their zone-blitz defense, the Falcons
worked extra this week on blitz pickups, often focusing on making
sure a running back is available to help with outside rushes.
Cincinnati plays a very similar defense, and has 12 sacks in three
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Schmooze time
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons held their annual kickoff luncheon Thursday, in
connection with the Atlanta Sports Council, on the floor of the
Georgia Dome. With some 1,400 in attendance, left tackle Bob
Whitfield again stole the show. When he was being questioned in
front of the audience, Whitfield showed a lighter side rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Upon standing up with the microphone in hand, he said, ``Look,
I'm telling you all, I'm not going to be funny today. I'm tired of
being Bob Joker.'' But he changed tunes. Asked to critique lunch,
he said, ``What was that potato pattie thing? It was like a
sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to tell the audience something they didn't know about
Reeves, he said, ``He's got the ugliest knees in America. They look
like they got hit by a dump truck. And he's always trying to tan
them at practice.''
</P>

 &HT;    Safe at any speed?
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Driving a car at speeds as fast as 230 mph can be a
dangerous business, but in Saturday night's Atlanta Classic 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway, at least two drivers _ both of whom have
wrecked and suffered injuries _ would rather be on the track than
on I-75.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat, who drives the No. 11 Conseco/A.J. Foyt
Dallara/Aurora/Goodyear, and former Atlantan John Paul Jr., pilot
of the No. 10 Byrd/Cunningham Dallara/Aurora/Firestone agree that
going 230 mph in a crowd of professional race car drivers, in
cutting-edge machines designed to protect them in crashes, is the
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``On I-75, you don't know the guy next to you, if he's sober or
if he has a gun,'' Boat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is not a problem,'' Paul agreed. ``I fully trust all the
drivers on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither has to worry about an 18-wheeler in the wrong lane
tailgating a Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Speeds were promising as drivers prepared for today's qualifying
_ especially considering the track temperature for the daytime
session was 130 degrees, which has a big effect on control. Scott
Sharp had the fastest lap during daytime practice at 222.472 mph,
followed closely by Indy 500 winner Eddie Cheever at 222.062.
Paul's best, 217.446, was 14th.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, John Andretti won NASCAR's Primestar 500 pole at
AMS in March with a top speed of 192.956 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt decided to wait until the night practice session to
run Boat and teammate Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   IRL cars are engineered to protect the driver. They are designed
to collapse and break apart, absorbing shock. However, one result
is flying debris, such as the tire that killed spectators in the
stands at Michigan Speedway during a CART race earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't have happened at AMS. General manager Ed
Clark pointed out that the safety fence that protects the
grandstands hangs over the track and is reinforced with continuous
strands of cable that would force pieces, or whole cars, back onto
the track.
</P>
<P>
   Shown a photo of the improved grandstand fence at Michigan,
Clark said, ``It looks like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   As a safety precaution, though, the first 15 rows of grandstand
seats will be empty, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boat and Paul have made major comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   After winning at Texas, Boat suffered a broken leg and pelvis in
the next race at New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He took only seven weeks to get back in the cockpit, won the
pole at the Radisson 200 at Pike's Peak and was running second with
a lap and a half to go when his car ran out of gas. He finished
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Boat still uses a cane, made of the same carbon fiber as the IRL
cars and light as a feather.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about wrecks and fear: ``When you grow up racing,
you're always aware there's a potential to get hurt. When you move
up, the potential will increase.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boat, 32 years old and 5-foot-7, 140 pounds of grit, did
what the great ones do, including Paul: When you get knocked down,
get back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought of was, `How can I work harder to get back?' ''
Boat said. ``I was in the gym every day, the first six weeks on
crutches.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul crushed an ankle in the 1997 Indy 500 in a head-on crash.
Nearly the same thing happened in 1983, also at Indy. The lanky
38-year-old is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get your confidence back,'' Paul admitted,
yet he grinned and quipped that head-on collisions come only ``15
years apart.''

 &HT;    AMS general manager has eye on numbers
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern stock-car fans still look at open-wheeled race cars the
same way they'd regard a chukar if they ran into one on a quail
hunt: ``That's a strange lookin' bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans aren't flocking to Southern tracks to watch the Indy Racing
League. Yet the VisionAire 500 in Charlotte drew 50,000-plus, which
would be a good turnout for the Falcons and even the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta Motor Speedway general manager Ed Clark thinks
Saturday's Atlanta 500 Classic will do as well or better than the
VisionAire 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long and short of it is, We will be able to consider it a
success?'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Success, he said, would be 50,000, even though that number won't
resemble a large crowd in a grandstand that holds 60,996. When a
Winston Cup race is on the track, the stands and the infield are
filled, with a total crowd of 135,000 a good estimate.
</P>
<P>
   However, this race doesn't appear to be a one-shot deal. Clark
said the super speedways need more big races for cash flow, and
they apparently are banking on IRL.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark said he hasn't resorted to dropping free tickets from
airplanes. Fans can find discounts, but someone has paid for the
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Pep Boys, the IRL series sponsor, has a block of tickets and is
giving away pairs to customers who purchase $99 in merchandise.
Participants in the Greg LeMond bike ride for the PATH Foundation
will get a ticket. Fans also can find a $20 discount coupon off the
$50 ticket in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield honorary starter
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't compare with carrying the Olympic torch, but
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield will wave the green flag as
honorary starter for Saturday's race. ``This is another great event
for the city of Atlanta, and I'm excited about watching the first
lap from the best seat in the house,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA pole
</P>
<P>
   Tim Steele of Coopersville, Mich., won the pole position for
tonight's ARCA Georgia Power 200. His speed of 180.621 mph was only
one mph faster than second-place Jeff Finley of Diamondville, Mich.
Rounding out the top five were Kirk Shelmerdine, winner of the
March ARCA event at AMS, Bill Baird and Andy Hillenberg. Twenty
five cars were on the track Thursday battling for the remaining 18
starting spots. ... Winner, hands-down, of ARCA nickname of the
race, Harris DeVane, the ``Cuthbert Kamikaze.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pits
</P>
<P>
   The IRL is having media events around town. On Wednesday, a
lunchtime crowd at CNN Center saw a pit-stop contest between the
Eddie Cheever team and Scott Goodyear and Panther Racing. Team
Cheever took the best-of-five contest on the fifth pit stop. The
$1,000 prize went to the Kid Stuff Foundation. ... Interesting
comparison: An L-1011 airliner weighs 349,000 pounds and lifts off
at 163 mph. An IRL race car weighs about 1,600 pounds, and no one
is sure how it stays on the ground at 230 mph.

 &HT;    LeMond: `Racing's in my blood'
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Ask Greg LeMond what he'd like to be doing in 10
years, and he'll look you straight in the eye and say something
about fly fishing on the Smith River in central Montana. Don't you
believe him.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond loves fishing. No doubt about that. But LeMond loves
speed and competition even more. And unless he can figure out a way
to fish at 100 mph while competing against a dozen other people,
he's just not going to do it for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing's in my blood,'' LeMond says. ``I'm a very good
competitor. I hate to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that competitive drive that first attracted LeMond to
bicycle racing, where during nearly 20 years he conquered all,
winning three Tour de France competitions and two world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   A rare muscle disease forced him to retire in 1994, but LeMond's
love for speed and competition led him into a new career as a
race-car driver. He's in his second year of U.S. Formula Ford 2000
series racing, and LeMond brings his AutoConnect-sponsored
Indy-type car to Atlanta Motor Speedway for a race Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   While in Atlanta, LeMond also will give a benefit speech tonight
and lead a charity bike ride Saturday morning to benefit the PATH
foundation, which is working to expand Atlanta's network of
greenway trails.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a humbling two years for America's most famous bike
racer, a man used to competing _ and winning _ at the highest
levels.
</P>
<P>
   After a rookie 1997 year in which LeMond never placed higher
than 11th and finished the season in 24th place in a field of 53
competitors, you'd think he would be happy with two third-place and
two seventh-place finishes so far this year. Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even more unhappy this year,'' LeMond said, bemoaning the
five times in 11 races that he's crashed. ``When I've been able to
race, I've been fairly competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMond knows he still has a long climb from the minor leagues of
racing to the Indianapolis 500, his goal for the year 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He's been here before.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, he started riding a bike with his father. By age
16 in 1977 he began dominating national junior races. Two years
later, LeMond captured the Junior World Championship road race
title.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was a dizzying climb to the top: member of the
1980 Olympic squad that did not compete because of the U.S.
boycott; world champion in the 1983 road race; third-place finish
in the 1984 Tour De France, his first attempt at the world's
best-known and toughest bicycle race. LeMond reached the pinnacle
in 1986, when he fought off Bernard Hinault to win the Tour de
France, the first American to do so. But in 1987, LeMond's
brother-in-law accidentally shot him while they hunted turkey in
California. LeMond nearly bled to death and then faced a long and
painful recovery from surgery to remove shotgun pellets from his
liver, kidney and intestines. To this day, he still carries about
30 pellets in his body, some near his heart. Later that year,
LeMond had to undergo an emergency appendectomy.LeMond came back in
1989 to secure his place in sports history by winning his second
Tour de France, a victory he clinched on the last day of the
three-week race by beating Frenchman Laurent Fignon by eight
seconds, the smallest margin of victory in Tour history. That feat
earned LeMond the Sports Illustrated 1989 Sportsman of the Year
award.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond captured his third Tour in 1990 but then started an
inexplicable and frustrating slide. He struggled to a seventh-place
finish in the 1991 race and then failed to complete the 1992 Tour
and did not even start in 1993. In 1994, he again failed to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' LeMond said, ``I did everything I could to
survive the last couple of years of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   After countless visits to doctors, no one could figure out why
LeMond was fading so fast. Finally, a biopsy of a leg muscle in
1994 provided the answer: mitochondrial myopathy, a rare genetic
disease that prevents the body from recovering adequately after
stress. His career was over.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, some friends persuaded LeMond to enroll in Jim
Russell's Racing School in California. Within a half-hour of
strapping into the cockpit and whizzing around the course at 150
mph, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I did it,'' LeMond said, ``I realized I love speed.
That's why I got into bike racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he turned pro, racing under the sponsorship of
Manheim Auctions, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, which also owns
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This year, his sponsorship was
picked up by AutoConnect, a Manheim subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel happy about my driving,'' LeMond said. ``It's pretty
consistent. But I've had problems with my qualifying times.''
</P>
<P>
   He likens the learning curve he's going through to his first
three or four years of bike racing. But he realizes that at 37 he
doesn't have many more years to break through. And he's got a wife
and three children to think of.
</P>
<P>
   ``In car racing,'' he said, ``you don't have a long life unless
you make improvements. It costs a lot of money. And I'm not one to
stay in a sport where I'm in the middle of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, LeMond is back where he thrives _ in the thick
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the kind of life I'd like to,'' he said. ``The only
thing I wish I could do is a little more fishing. Now that I'm so
busy, I dream of that. But when I was bike racing, I would dream of
that. I may be always fantasizing about what I can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wish I had more free time. I like doing things in
life. I like trying new things. I'm a high-energy person who likes
doing different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Different things that go fast. Against some other guy.

ROYAL GRADUATE MIGHT GET FIRST COLLEGE START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC freshman defensive end Ryan Nielsen of
Royal High in Simi Valley could get his first college start Sunday
when the Trojans play Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   An ankle injury has limited starter Lawrence Larry's
availability and USC coach Paul Hackett has not decided if he'll be
healthy enough to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming along slowly, but (the trainers) are encouraged
he'll be OK for the game,'' Hackett said. ``I don't know if he'll
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Nielsen would probably replace Larry in the lineup,
although he might also go with sophomore Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano said Thursday that he doesn't expect to
start because his pulled hamstring is only 90 percent recovered,
but he will play. Fullback Marvin Powell is also expected to be
available, although he remains bothered by a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fletcher's fine: Former Alemany High tailback Miguel Fletcher
has survived his first training camp nicely and he probably
deserves some courage points for telling Hackett he wanted to
remain at tailback even though a position change was pondered.
</P>
<P>
   At least four other players, including quarterbacks Quincy Woods
and John Fox, have switched positions during camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I made a statement to the coach,'' Fletcher said.
``He said I could play whatever I wanted, and I said I want to stay
a tailback. I knew I could play tailback. Now I just have something
to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who will probably redshirt, is working out with the
scout team this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Crowd count: USC officials are anticipating a crowd of
55,000-60,000 for the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking it easy: Hackett has tapered practices considerably,
working just 90 minutes the past two days after holding a pair of
three-hour practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure we're not going to burn them out,'' he said.
``We worked them very hard when we were down here and we don't want
to mess things up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ All-around athlete: Who's the best athlete on the football
team? Probably safety Ife Ohalete, who won the team's home run
hitting contest and bowling competition Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ohalete outslugged quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst and offensive
lineman Zach Wilson to win the home run derby. He then bowled a 186
to capture that title. Offensive lineman Brent McCaffrey finished
last by bowling a 36.
</P>
<P>
   __ Where's the weight room?: USC's players got a break from
lifting weights on Thursday. The weight equipment was transported
back to Los Angeles, leaving just an empty tent next to the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans officially break camp this morning and head back to
Los Angeles.

 Behind Moscow's Drubbing of America's Stock Markets   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
To Russia, with love.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market got whacked yesterday like a Moscow mobster, as
the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 4.2 percent and the Nasdaq
stock market fell 4.6 percent. We've seen the market take some
terrible tumbles before, but yesterday's hit was a bloody mess.
Fifteen companies reported 52-week highs while 998 firms hit annual
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really ugly. There was capitulation and there was
panic,'' says Paul Siegal, president of Hollis Capital Management,
a private investment partnership that manages about $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The market meltdown was blamed in part on a currency shortage in
Russia. Why a former world power's dilapidated economy would take
the Dow out at its knees, I have no idea. But the financial
community is always looking for a culprit, even if the real factors
behind market swings are far more complex than a single day's
geopolitical machinations. Which is probably the case here.
Besides, Asia's bad-guy role in the recent turbulence was getting
too predictable.
</P>
<P>
   So this time it was Russia's turn. The long and short of it is
that the Russian government is broke. Now that's not
earth-shattering news. But the government has only $17 billion in
reserves to pay off foreign debt. And the trouble is that it has to
make payments of $30 billion in short-term loans in the near
future, says senior portfolio manager Josephine Jimenez of
Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbacks are nearly impossible to come by in Russia because
the country doesn't have enough U.S. dollars to cover its debts.
Consequently, the government-controlled central bank stopped
selling dollars for the second day in a row yesterday, making it
nearly impossible to determine the value of the country's currency,
the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   When you don't know how much your money is worth, it's pretty
hard to tell if and when you can pay back your debts. This isn't
great news for the world's financial institutions who have lent
money to companies in the former Soviet bloc, including American
banks, says Jimenez, whose fund invests in emerging markets
including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it good news for American companies that sell goods and
services to Russia. If they don't get paid, their earnings go down.
And if their profits are already hindered because Asian customers
can't pay, then their foreign profits are socked by a double
whammy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, naturally, if Coca-Cola's profits sink, its stock is
likely to do the same. (Coke stock closed yesterday at $74.75, down
$4.44.)
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a connection to the U.S. stock market. Not to
mention that a financial meltdown in a nation that possesses
nuclear warheads is also generally upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, because European stocks have been one of the better
performers this year, their exposure to Russia makes them less
attractive, says Jimenez, whose firm has $1.6 billion invested in
emerging markets but only 1 percent in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has been one of the brighter spots in the world
economy, and that's where geopolitics comes into play'' regarding
equities markets, Jimenez says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all of the attention placed on Moscow, there are a
lot of reasons why the market is letting off steam. It has been
overpriced. Japanese banks are drowning in nonperforming loans. And
deflation is making it difficult for companies to raise their
prices and earn higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these factors have been chipping away at the
strength of the market for some time, says portfolio manager Eric
Flett of Gemmer Asset Management in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage had already been done and it started in July,''
says Flett, whose firm manages about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is down 12.5 percent from its record high of 9,337.9 on
July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yesterday's 4 percent decline is a drop in the bucket,''
Flett says.
</P>
<P>
   So what are investors to do when it looks like the market is
sinking faster than Leonardo DiCaprio?
</P>
<P>
   You know the mantra. Sit tight, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good example of where you don't want to sell into a
downdraft,'' says investment adviser Robert Bingham, principal of
Bingham, Osborn &AMP; Scarborough in San Francisco, which manages $425
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors should wait for the volatility to decrease and then
reassess your portfolio,'' Bingham says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do not react immediately to the panic-driven (sell-off).''
</P>
<P>
   And when you do decide to take action, don't do anything
drastic. If you happen to be so deep into stocks that you can't
sleep at night, you may want to convert some of those holdings into
bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't time the market, but you can create a cushion`` by
increasing your allocation of fixed-income investments, Bingham
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have these really steep downturns, you'll find there
really are no safe havens,'' he says.

 Workers To Average 4% Raises   By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
California employees will get raises that average 4 percent this
year _ about the same as in 1997, according to a report released
yesterday by William M. Mercer Inc.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that 4-percent average masks a growing disparity in raises
and compensation within the state's workforce.
</P>
<P>
   A small minority of very skilled workers will get raises as high
as 50 percent this year, while most California employees will
receive minimal or no pay increases, according to Mercer analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take that 4 percent average and divvy it up, you're
looking at companies giving most of their employees small increases
or no increases in order to give more to their high performers,''
said Charles King, a senior compensation consultant with Mercer's
San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer _ a nationwide human resources management consulting firm
_ based its 16th annual survey of California compensation trends on
data from 232 large companies such as Bank of America, Chevron and
PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   The companies indicated that they plan to give somewhat bigger
raises to high-level employees than to low-level ones. They've
budgeted for raises averaging 4.2 percent for executives, 4 percent
for exempt employees, and 3.9 percent for nonexempt, nonunion
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer analysts said the data show that, despite the current low
unemployment rate, companies are managing to avoid major wage
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay is moving up at about the same level it has for the past
seven or eight years,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep labor costs down, a growing number of companies are
adopting one-time rewards like bonuses that don't become a built-in
part of employees' wage base.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are also increasingly trying to link workers' pay to
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-four percent of companies said they see merit and
performance as ``very important'' factors in raises, while only 5
percent see the cost of living as very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing across-the-board increases like in the
1970s,'' King said. ``The biggest raises are going to employees
whose jobs require specialized or technical knowledge, from
software engineers to attorneys, accountants and human resource
analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add up the impact of (noncash benefits like) stock,
this bipolar compensation model becomes even more dramatic,'' King
added. ``The winners win bigger and bigger, while the losers lose
more and more ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies surveyed were generally optimistic about the
economy and their hiring plans. About half said they plan to add
employees this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey was taken between March and May. Since then, a
growing number of companies have reported earnings drops due to
economic problems in Asia and Russia. Some, like Applied Materials,
have imposed layoffs and pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have data showing that companies are revising their
compensation budgets down for '98, but they may well be revising
them down for '99,'' King warned.
</P>
<P>
   Along with pay, the Mercer report tracked the different kinds of
benefits offered by California firms.
</P>
<P>
   Among noncash benefits, the fastest-growing single item was
health coverage for employees' domestic partners. Eleven percent of
firms said they had added domestic partner coverage within the past
year. That brought the total share of firms offering domestic
partner coverage to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other fast-growing benefits included individual and group
incentive pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual incentive pay'' refers to a one-time reward or
bonus based on the performance of an individual employee.
Sixty-four percent of firms offer this to their nonexecutive
employees, including 7 percent who just started offering it within
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Group incentive pay'' refers to a one-time reward based on the
performance of a work group or team. Thirty-three percent of firms
now offer this, including 5 percent who just started offering it
within the past year.  &LR;

PLEASE, YOUR HONOR, HALT DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Judge Joe Brown? Los Angeles here.
</P>
<P>
   I stand before you, Your Honor, because I'm being stalked by a
man who usually dresses in all white but is never going to be
mistaken for an angel. I'm beseeching you for a restraining order
against this person who has a dark side to match the moon's.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a coincidence that his followers all wear black. I
don't want him within 300 miles of my city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Please help deliver me from the clutches of Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   You grew up in South Central, so I trust you know our history.
Al and I were close once, that I freely admit. I adored the man and
his band of renegades when he turned to me in 1982 on the rebound
after his relationship with Oakland ended acrimoniously.
</P>
<P>
   He and his football team appealed to my wilder nature. The
Raiders pilloried politeness and pretension. They brought out the
rogue in me. The chrome-and-leather scene was titillating at first,
never more so than during the Raiders' Super Bowl championship
season of 1983. But after a while the goose bumps gave way to
gashes.
</P>
<P>
   The scene turned bad and my reputation took a beating with every
new fracas that broke out in my backyard during Raiders home games.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, it was even worse. I grew so weary of Al's
bullying. He has this compulsion to control. Lest you think I'm
exaggerating, read Marcus Allen's autobiography. Allen was a
running back with the Raiders for 11 years until he escaped to
Kansas City as a free agent after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Al was gone. He was lured back to Oakland by
the almighty dollar, much to my relief. I wished him good riddance
and was hopeful I had seen the last of him. But now he's making
explicit threats to return.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what exactly he's angling for. I just know he'll
make my life miserable. Honestly, I've been a wreck ever since I
heard he asked the NFL to buy out the dozen years remaining on his
lease in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   If Al leaves Oakland in the lurch, I have no illusions as to
where he'll wind up. It won't be Houston, it won't be Toronto.
It'll be my doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   He acts like he owns me, which is so insulting. The arrogance of
the man is astonishing. Why can't he see there's nothing left of
our relationship to salvage?
</P>
<P>
   I'm so over him. I don't miss his power trips and his
high-maintenance personality.
</P>
<P>
   He's like those other stalkers I've read about who have
delusions that the object of their fixation is in love with them.
An erotomaniac, that's what Al is. People like him take the tiniest
of cues and interpret them to mean the object of their attention is
in love with them. Fine, but if Al thinks a city councilman's
clumsy overtures are a sign of my devotion, he's sadly misguided.
Nate Holden has a voice, but he doesn't speak for me.
</P>
<P>
   I say Al needs his counsel, Joseph Alioto, less than he does
counseling. Only a deluded man would talk as though he left me
three years ago against his will, that league officials sabotaged
his designs on Hollywood Park and, in doing so, forced him out.
</P>
<P>
   For once I wish someone else's will would be done. I don't want
him in my life any more than the other NFL owners do.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the fact his sorry team won only
four games last year. The simple truth is, I don't need pro
football to elevate my self-image or fill my leisure time. Unlike
Al, I have many interests, and I'm blessed with the ideal climate
with which to pursue all my hobbies. With the mountains, the sea,
the arts and entertainment such as the Lakers, Clippers and Kings
all at my fingertips, what need do I have for another diversion?
</P>
<P>
   Al doesn't see it that way, of course. He stares right through
me and sees the gateway to the entertainment world and its
corridors of power and a corporate climate that is raining dollars
and a population that's larger than all but seven states.
</P>
<P>
   He can covet me 'till the bikers come home, but he'll never
possess me. If I have to, I'll follow the lead of the former
Raiders assistant coach who decided to put a hex on Al. He wet a
photograph of Al and placed it in the freezer. That was in the fall
of 1995. I'd say the curse has worked pretty well to this point.
But frankly, I'd rather have the vernacular of the law on my side
than voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do you say, Your Honor, can I have that restraining
order now?
</P>

ROCKET EXPLOSION A BLOW TO BOEING'S SATELLITE LAUNCH BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion of The Boeing Co.'s new Delta III rocket on its
maiden flight Wednesday night is a blow to the U.S. hopes of
wresting more of the commercial satellite launch business from the
French, Chinese and Russians.
</P>
<P>
   And although the direct financial impact on Boeing is likely to
be minimal, the company lost an opportunity to grab early market
share in this increasingly important segment of the space business,
industry experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The failure could push the Delta III program back by as much as
six months or more, depending on how quickly an accident
investigation team is able to pinpoint what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing could have really done some damage to Arianespace and
they have missed out on that for now,'' said Marco Caceres, a
rocket and space analysts with the Teal Group, a marketing analysis
firm in Fairfx, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe the Europeans are very happy right now
....''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing was hoping to increase its share of the commercial
launch market. This puts everything on hold. It prevents them from
leaping ahead and taking an early market share.''
</P>
<P>
   In a market once dominated by the U.S., the French company
Arianespace now launches more than half the world's communications
satellites _ a business that in a few years is expected to be worth
upwards of $20 billion annually. U.S. companies have about 30
percent of the market with the rest divided between Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
   Once it proved itself as a reliable launch vehicle, Delta III
was expected to bring a good chunk of the commercial business back
to the U.S., and to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But about 55 seconds after lifting off from launch complex 17B
at Cape Canaveral Wednesday evening, the first Delta III began to
veer out of control and a range safety officer pushed a button that
sent an electronic signal to blow up the rocket. By the time the
signal was sent, the 128-foot rocket was already breaking up at an
altitude of about 10 miles. Flaming pieces of the rocket and its
$200 million-plus communications satellite fell into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Gale Schluter, the vice president of Boeing's expendable launch
systems in Huntington Beach, Calif., where the Delta rockets are
built, said the company considers the Delta III failure ``to be
very serious to our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Quan, an experienced Boeing engineer at Huntington
Beach, was named to lead the accident investigation team. The Air
Force will also participate and the investigation will be monitored
by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Quan nor other Boeing officials involved in the Delta
III program were available for comment, but Quan will take
questions about the accident during a teleconference with the media
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, off Cape Canaveral Thursday, aircraft searched for
floating pieces of the rocket that could help investigators. While
there are no current plans for underwater salvage, the
investigation team will assess that need as more information
becomes available, a Boeing spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   At an early morning news conference Thursday, Brig. Gen. Randall
Starbuck, commander of the 45th Space Wing at Patrick AFB in
Florida, said the flight appeared to be going as expected until the
rocket pitched out of control between 55 and 65 seconds into the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   At 75 seconds, the Air Force sent a destruct signal to the Delta
III. It is not clear if the rocket's self-destruct system had
already been activated by then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators don't know why the rocket went out of control,
Starbuck said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, an Air Force Titan 4A built by Lockheed
Martin and carrying a $1 billion spy satellite blew up 40 seconds
after launch from Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being punched in the belly,'' Starbuck said of the
back to back launch failures.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the Titan explosion has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Delta III accident investigators are certain to
focus on are the 9 solid rocket motors that strap to the sides of
the first stage and help the main engine during the early stages of
flight. Any problem with one of those rockets could have thrown the
vehicle out of control, rocket experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage engine of the Delta II and Delta III are built
by Boeing's Rocketdyne and are nearly identical. The engine is
considered very reliable. But the strap-on solid rockets for Delta
III are new and unproven. They are more powerful than the ones used
on Delta II.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those rockets fire at liftoff and are thrust-vectoring,
meaning the rocket nozzles can be moved to provide additional
control. This is something new for Delta III because it is heavier
than Delta II and needs more control capability than just the main
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The three remaining solid rockets fire at 79 seconds into
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Although cameras at the Cape that tracked the Delta III appeared
to show the solid rockets peeling away moments before the
explosion, that apparently was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   The first set of three solid rockets do not break away from the
first stage until 80.5 seconds into the flight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rupture in one of the strap-on rockets that resulted in
the explosion of a Delta II 12 seconds after liftoff from Cape
Canaveral in January 1997. That was the last failure of one of
Boeing's Delta rockets, which the company acquired when it bought
McDonnell Douglas last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said a decision has not been made whether to postpone
next Tuesday's launch of a Delta II from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California. It will carry several satellites for Motorola's
Iridium worldwide mobile phone network.
</P>
<P>
   And NASA plans to use Delta II rockets to launch its Deep Space
1 technology test bed spacecraft and two probes to Mars in December
and January.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency will closely monitor the progress of Delta III
investigation to determine the possible effect on its upcoming
missions, a NASA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident had little effect on Boeing's stock Thursday. On a
day when the market fell more than 350 points, Boeing's stock fell
less than $1 a share to close at $35.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock of PanAmSat Corp. fell 15 percent after the
company told analysts the loss of its Galaxy X communications
satellite carried by Delta III will mean a loss of about $200
million in revenue this year. The company planned to lease the
satellite to television broadcasters and companies such as MCI.
</P>
<P>
   PanAmSat spokesman Dan Marcus said the satellite was fully
insured. The company contracted with Hughes to build the satellite
and find a launch provider, in this case Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta III also was insured. That is standard practice in the
risky launch business.
</P>
<P>
   Delta III is the first large launch vehicle ever built entirely
with corporate rather than government money.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needs Delta III to better compete in the exploding
commercial launch business, in which more powerful rockets are
needed to launch heavy communications satellites into orbits high
above the Earth. Most of that heavy-lift commercial launch business
now goes to France, China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The new Delta III can launch payloads twice as heavy as the
existing Delta II rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it is charging customers about $85 million to
launch their satellites on its Delta III, though some industry
analysts believe the actual figure is closer to about $55 million
so Boeing can stay competitive with the French.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has not said how much the three-year Delta III
development project cost, but it was probably at least $1.5
billion, according to Caceres, the rocket and space analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much Hughes agreed to pay then McDonnell Douglas in
1995 to launch a block of 10 satellites, with options to launch 10
more _ the first of which was the Galaxy X. Using that $1.5 billion
commitment from Hughes, Boeing raised other private capitol to
build the more powerful Delta III which would be needed for the
heavier satellite missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That $1.5 billion was probably a good chunk of the development
costs, but I'm not sure of the total amount,'' Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had planned a second Delta III launch later this year,
but that will not take place until investigators have learned what
went wrong Wednesday night and the problem is fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said that even though Delta II has an excellent record,
he was not all that surprised the first Delta III blew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trend you will see over the next five years as new
launch vehicles are introduced,'' he said. ``Almost every new
launch vehicle in the last few years has failed the first time
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those first-launch failures include the new Ariane 5 built by
Arianespace. It is far more powerful than the Delta III.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high risk business,'' Caceres said. ``You are
putting your vehicles out there in front of everyone and if it
blows up, you look real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Boeing did not need after suffering
through one of its worst years ever in 1997 because of the highly
publicized production problems with its core product _ commercial
airplanes.

 Intel Lab Spotlights Association With Microsoft   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Hillsboro, Ore. 
 
The Intel Architecture Labs showcase something beyond cool
technology: the chip giant's love/hate relationship with its main
partner in the personal computer business, software giant
Microsoft.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with Microsoft, though we don't always
see things the same way,'' said Craig Kinnie, an Intel vice
president and the director of the labs.
</P>
<P>
   One of those disagreements may mushroom into a factor in the
federal government's antitrust case against Microsoft, according to
reports made public this week.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute erupted several years ago when ``Intel was concerned
that Microsoft wasn't doing enough with multimedia,'' said Linley
Gwennap, editor of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Intel launched its own multimedia initiative at the Oregon lab.
The New York Times reported this week that Microsoft's effort to
squelch Intel's multimedia work is now under scrutiny in the
Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Intel representatives wouldn't talk about those reports, other
than to confirm that the company has complied with Department of
Justice requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier interviews, Kinnie said Intel steers clear of
anything that would directly compete with Microsoft's operating
system. Instead, Kinnie said, Intel develops ``technology building
blocks'' that Microsoft incorporates into its operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel labs have developed 15 key technologies that are part
of Windows 98, including the application launch accelerator, the
universal serial bus, DVD software and WebTV for Windows, through
which users can watch television over their PC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A Microsoft spokesman yesterday said the two companies'
overall relationship remains close. ``We're two independent
companies involved in developing and innovating some very
fast-moving technology,'' said Jim Cullinan. ``When it comes to the
bottom line, we work together as partners to make things easier to
understand. There may be disagreement at times over the
17-year-relationship,'' but the companies generally get along, and
neither one pushes the other around, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Microsoft ``have some areas where their interests
overlap and line up, and other areas where they're clearly at cross
purposes,'' said Nathan Brookwood, a chip analyst at Dataquest in
San Jose. ``All in all, the companies share the mantle of
leadership pretty effectively. You see little power struggles here
and there, but they're still locked in a highly symbiotic
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies also differ in their approach to their own
research labs. While Intel's labs stay focused on product
development, Microsoft maintains a research effort that looks far
into the future. Part of that effort includes a nine-person lab in
San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, headed by computer
industry legends Jim Gray and Gordon Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Microsoft's research takes place at the
corporation's Redmond, Wash., campus. Former Carnegie Mellon
University professor Rick Rashid, who brought an academic
perspective, leads a team of 300 researchers, expected to double by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is headquartered in Santa Clara and had revenues of
$25 billion last year, now employs 500 people in its research labs.
Most of them work in Hillsboro, although about 50 are in California
and Arizona.

 Silicon Valley Giant Intel Is Even Bigger in Oregon   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 Hillsboro, Ore.  
 
Intel is known as a paranoid company, but that's not a new
phenomenon. It was a fear of earthquakes more than 20 years ago
that led Intel to establish its first factory outside of Silicon
Valley, here in a former Oregon cow pasture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Thomson, who was one of the first 100 people hired at
Intel 30 years ago, flew up to Oregon in 1976 at the behest of
Gordon Moore, Intel's chief executive at the time. Someone at
Tektronix, an Oregon electronics manufacturer, had recommended the
state to Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson and a colleague asked a real estate agent, ``Show us
what you have in 30-acre sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed us two,'' Thomson recalled. ``Everybody was nice.
Tektronix was there. Gordon said, `Let's build there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, site selection is ``a huge, involved
process,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, 58, retired this month as Intel vice president and
Oregon site manager. Jim B. Johnson is taking his place.
</P>
<P>
   The first facility, Fab 4 _ so named because it was the
company's fourth fabrication plant _ is also entering into its own
retirement after years of upgrades. It's being rehabbed into office
space, and Intel is donating the outdated semiconductor process
equipment to community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Intel runs six major campuses in Oregon, most named for the
former farms they now occupy, and employs 11,000 people there. Not
only is it the largest private employer in the state, but it
employs more people in Oregon than it does anywhere else in the
world _ more than at its Santa Clara headquarters, where 9,000
people work.
</P>
<P>
   So many Intel employees are on the Alaska Airlines early morning
flights between Portland and San Jose that the plane is known as
the ``Nerd Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel occupies 4.2 million square feet in the valley west of
Portland and owns more than 425 acres, with more than enough room
for expansion, Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel operates two fabs in Oregon, and its Hillsboro facilities
have developed some of the chip giant's most cutting-edge
technology, including the Pentium II microprocessor that now
dominates the personal computing world.
</P>
<P>
   The Hillsboro facilities also handle all design and development
of Intel motherboards and networking cards, as well as many other
facets of chip design.
</P>
<P>
   The chip industry employs one-fourth of Oregon's 70,000
high-tech workers, according to Jim Craven, government affairs
manager for the Oregon Council of the American Engineering
Association. It exports more than $6 billion a year, he said, even
more than the state's vaunted timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   But companies like Hewlett-Packard, LSI Logic, Hyundai and NEC
that have followed Intel to Oregon have changed the landscape.
Traffic now backs up along Highway 26, the Sunset Highway that
leads to Hillsboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from school in 1937, there were 18 of us,''
said Lee Haverstick, 76, a retired mechanic sipping a beer in the
funky Helvetia Tavern three miles from Hillsboro. ``It was all
farmland. It's changed quite a bit since we got Intel and
everybody.''

 KILLING SHOWS CONNECTICUT THE LIMITS OF ITS `MEGAN'S LAW' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIMANTIC, Conn. _ When the Connecticut legislature joined a
national bandwagon and passed a ``Megan's Law'' to notify citizens
about convicted sex offenders who move into their neighborhoods,
lawmakers said they were giving parents a way to know when their
children could be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But now an 11-year-old papergirl is dead, and a neighbor _ a
convicted sex offender _ has been charged with capital murder.
Bitter parents are complaining that the notification law has failed
them, and lawmakers of both parties are pledging to go back to work
next winter to make the law even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A law on the books is a beginning, not an end,'' said state
Sen. Kevin Sullivan, a Democrat who is the president pro tempore.
``People have to be aware of it, police departments have to be
aggressive, and we in the legislature learn the strengths and
weaknesses in the application. This is a terrible way to learn that
you need to do something more.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the states that have passed versions of the
notification law, including New York and New Jersey, the police
send fliers or registered letters to the neighbors of sex offenders
who are considered likely to act again. But in Connecticut and 14
other states, citizens have to ask the local police for the
information instead of being told.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Willimantic, a blue-collar town of 15,000 in
northeastern Connecticut, the police have a thick black binder with
information about all the registered sex offenders in the area. But
the fat packets of information are sorted alphabetically, not by
address, making it cumbersome to check any particular area. In any
case, Police Chief Milton King said only two people in three years
had ever looked at the list.
</P>
<P>
   After the Aug. 13 killing of the paper carrier, Angelica
Padilla, several residents realized the value of the information
and asked to see it. But King suddenly closed the book, saying that
the sex offenders were now suspects in the case and that the
release of the information could harm his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   So for the 13 days from the killing until the arrest of Jose
Torres, 25, on Wednesday night, parents had no way to narrow their
suspicions, and many kept their children indoors.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the neighbors had been able to look at the list,
Torres might have escaped their notice. The address he had listed
was out of date and more than a mile from where he was living at
the time Angelica was killed. And King said the law was too vague
to force Torres to update his address.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Grahn, 51, who lives one floor below the apartment of
Torres, said she knew all about the notification law but assumed
that the authorities would notify her if she was in danger. ``Isn't
that common sense?'' But Ms. Grahn, a deli supervisor, said she saw
other practical problems with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known this type of person _ and I use that loosely _
was in the building, I would move,'' she said. ``But that's not
fair to me. I can see how this brings out vigilantes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, concerns about vigilante attacks arose earlier this
summer after some a someone in Linden, N.J., fired shots into a
house of a paroled rapist shortly after officials circulated a
flier notifying neighbors that the man had moved into their town.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Angelica disappeared while delivering
copies of the local newspaper, The Chronicle, around the apartment
complex where she and Torres lived. Her body was discovered later
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say she was attacked in the basement laundry room of
Torres' building. She was struck on the head with a wrench, her
shorts were stripped off and she was dragged 100 feet into the
woods, where she was ``virtually decapitated,'' said the Windham
County state attorney, Mark Solak.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Torres lived with his girlfriend in the same apartment complex
as Angelica and her mother, who lived a few buildings away. He was
living in Willimantic when he was charged in 1996 with seven counts
stemming from an attack on a local woman, including first-degree
sexual assault, burglary and risking injury to a minor. He pleaded
guilty to third-degree sexual assault and unlawful restraint and
served about a year in prison before being released in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Torres made a 10-minute appearance Thursday morning in
Connecticut Superior Court in Putnam, where Judge Samuel Sferrazza
set bail at $1 million. An interpreter translated the proceedings
into Spanish for Torres, who said nothing and never looked at the
front bench.
</P>
<P>
   There he would have seen seven of Angelica's relatives _
including her mother, Millie Mercado _ holding hands and wearing
matching white T-shirts bearing a color silk-screen print of their
11-year-old ``angel,'' framed by a black border. Each wore a ribbon
of green, her favorite color.
</P>
<P>
   During the more than 90 minutes they had to wait past the
announced time for the court session, they cradled photos of
Angelica, told stories and alternately laughed, snuffled and cried.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could have prepared them for the gruesome description of
the crime that the prosecutor, Solak, gave while the judge
considered bond. Although investigators have not concluded whether
Angelica was sexually abused, Solak said the crime was ``sexually
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The evidence suggests this little girl was literally
butchered in the way that a rural farmer butchers a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing has prompted an outpouring of fury and alarm among
the town's residents. For days before his arrest, the Connecticut
police had staked out Torres' apartment. On Wednesday evening,
after the police announced that that they had solved the case,
about 500 people gathered at the apartment complex to await his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When he was brought out at 8:40 p.m., the crowd cheered the
police and swore at the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine states _ all but New Mexico _ have some type of
community notification law, requiring the registration of sex
offenders and authorizing release of the information to people who
could be affected. Most of them have active notification systems
like that of New Jersey, which passed the first such law in 1994,
after the rape and strangulation of 7-year-old Megan Kanka.
</P>
<P>
   J. Todd Mitchell, the manager of governmental affairs for the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said the
killing pointed to the need for even stronger notification laws.
``No law is going to protect a child,'' he said. ``But by
strengthening these laws, we want to arm parents with information
that will let them warn their children not to go near this house or
that car or individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Connecticut, the states with more passive
versions of such laws are: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, North Dakota,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in several Connecticut towns said they rarely
received requests to look at their registries of sex offenders,
although a Greenwich official said he had received occasional
inquiries from people considering buying a home in a certain
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the residents who have complained about the law
since Angelica's death, the police have their own concerns.
Sergeant Joseph May of the Norwich Police Department, about 15
miles from Willimantic, said officials have trouble keeping up with
the offenders' current addresses. ``You almost have to trust the
honesty of the individual released from prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Connecticut police chiefs said they planned to lobby the
Legislature to tighten the rules about updating the addresses of
convicted offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several proposals are being floated for this winter's
session. Rep. Angelo Fusco, an assistant Republican leader in the
House of Representatives, has proposed a requirement that the
police notify all residents within half of a mile of a convicted
sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Connecticut's approach say it is more sensitive to
the civil liberties of recovering sex offenders and prevents
unnecessary panic. But Fusco said Angelica's case was almost sure
to build support for tougher provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Even 24 hours after the arrest, emotions here had not ebbed.
Elaine Beckner and her 14-year-old son drove 30 miles from their
home in Willimantic to see Torres arraigned in Putnam. ``Killer!''
Ms. Beckner, 39, screamed as he was driven away in a white van.
</P>
<P>
   After court, she had one more errand _ one that she admitted she
had postponed for too long. She headed for the Willimantic police
station, to check the list of sex offenders.

   These were his people, fans with deep-enough roots to have known
him as Bob Devaney's first recruit, as an All-Big Eight fullback,
as Tom Osborne's right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Though his celebrity has rocketed since Osborne let college
football in on his and Solich's secret _ announcing last December
that Osborne would step down and Solich up as Nebraska's head coach
_ folks in Nebraska have recognized and appreciated Solich for
years.
</P>
<P>
   No one else could have made more sense to step into Osborne's
shoes. If Osborne failed to mention his choice that afternoon, most
of Nebraska would have assumed it and been ready to slap Solich's
back.
</P>
<P>
   But as head coach, when Solich added the usual circuit of alumni
functions and fund-raisers to his life, he noticed a small
distinction that as an assistant had escaped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very supportive,'' he said. ``They said, `You're
going to be great, coach. Everything is going to be great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I noticed, at other places they ask you how the team is
going to do. At Nebraska, they tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   At Nebraska, they order the championship as if super-sizing at
the drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line loses everybody but one part-time starter,
replacing the All-Americans with sophomores. And it is assumed the
Cornhuskers will maul anything in their path.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers replace a quarterback with a sophomore wingback
and lose one tailback to the NFL and another to a knee injury. They
send their most destructive defenders to the NFL with few
game-breakers stepping in. And they remain a top-five team expected
to contend for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And Solich, considering all the changes that could keep him
awake at night now that Osborne teaches classes and only
occasionally pokes his head in the football offices to say hello,
knows no one wants to hear the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the expectations are,'' he said. ``Some people may
have 8-3 expectations. I haven't run into any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has gone 60-3 in the past five seasons, winning three
national championships (it came within a missed field goal of a
fourth in five years). If it falls off its pace, the fingers will
point first to the coach replacing a legend, rather than a team
replacing its best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a new coach to be a little nervous,'' he
said. ``We don't have our offensive line returning, our quarterback
returning, our I-back returning. We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a short time to get there. Nebraska opens Saturday
against Louisiana Tech. DeAngelo Evans, the tailback heir to Ahman
Green, won't play for two or three weeks after undergoing
arthroscopic knee surgery. Starting safety Clint Finley is also
out. Bobby Newcombe will make his first start at quarterback behind
an offensive line that has struggled in every summer scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But no change brings the attention that is paid to Solich's role
as Osborne's successor. When Saturday's game begins, Solich will be
Nebraska's third coach since 1962, stepping in where Devaney and
Osborne produced 29 consecutive nine-win seasons, 275 weeks ranked
in the polls, 87 consecutive weeks in the top 10 and five national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   And the history of coaches succeeding legends is far from
glorious. Otherwise-successful coaches have failed to live up to
the standards left them, from Gene Bartow following John Wooden at
UCLA to Ray Perkins stepping into Bear Bryant's shadow at Alabama.
Even Osborne struggled to live up to Devaney and was for a time
decried as second-rate when Oklahoma consistently beat the
Cornhuskers for Big Eight supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Osborne was given patience that seems as dated as a rotary
telephone. And as great as Osborne's burden was following Devaney,
Solich arrives with three still-fresh national-championship
trophies to remind what is possible, and expected, in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of taking it day by day,'' he said of that burden.
``If you look too far down the road, it can be worrisome to you. To
look back to what coach Osborne did and coach Devaney, that can be
awesome. If you look day to day, you can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has focused on the half-full part of his coaching life.
Though Osborne left him a standard that could be impossible to
match, he also left a program that needs no repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are changes in personnel that could make the unthinkable
8-3 possible, though remote. But Solich made no changes to the
playbook, style or staff. He often sounds like Osborne, hits on the
same themes. As Osborne had as head coach, Solich will serve as his
own offensive coordinator. He similarly will call the offensive
plays and retain his mentor's devotion to the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not out to make my own mark,'' he said. ``I do not have
to separate myself from him. I'm not looking at number of wins or
percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Said senior fullback Joel Makovicka: ``The transition has been
so smooth between coach Osborne and coach Solich. The team accepted
it and went out and worked hard. It hasn't affected us as much as
everybody might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change style from coach to coach. We have
the same style of coach, the same philosophy, the same type of
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever burden Solich might carry might not be quite as
difficult as the load Osborne dropped before last season. Osborne
had shared his retirement plans with only the smallest circle of
confidants. Solich knew he would inherit the most dominant program
of the time but also knew that before his mentor would step down he
had to help provide a fitting send-off.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, even as friends and media asked about the day
he might become the Nebraska head coach, he had to keep that vow of
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had mentioned to me sometime prior to that he would forward
my name when he decided to retire,'' Solich said. ``He was going
strong and never showed signs he would retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Osborne is not one for a lot of flair. This was very
casually done. He knocked on the door and stepped in my office. He
asked if I had a moment. I had a lot of moments when coach showed
up. He said that was going to be it. The only question he had was
when to make the announcement. We discussed that a little bit. I
bet the whole thing didn't take 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to myself, `This is it.' The thought of running
the program hit me immediately. The responsibility of running the
program hit me. Coach asked me not to mention it to anyone. I knew
how things can spread even if you mention it to a small group. I
mentioned it to my wife and crossed my fingers there. We talked it
through and decided neither one of us would mention it to anyone
else. It was a very exciting moment, but I didn't have anyone to
celebrate it with, so I just sat there.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Osborne rarely asks the Nebraska head coach if he
has a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I see him and have to ask him to come in the
meeting room,'' Solich said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne has said he will not attend Saturday's game, to avoid
removing attention from the team and his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Solich said he wouldn't have minded had Osborne decided to come
by, certain that he cannot escape that shadow regardless of where
his mentor will spend his Saturdays. And he intends to remain too
busy to worry. As much as his added public responsibilities have
increased, Solich pledged to follow Osborne's lead and still take
on as much hands-on coaching as he can stand, from endless film
study to preparing his game plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's changed a great deal,'' Solich said. ``I did do many
more interviews. The media attention is much, much greater. Some of
that comes from the program itself. With Tom stepping down, that's
attracted more, and a new coach running the Nebraska program
attracted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me if you're not careful, that can really dominate
your time. I still want to be a football coach. Not all coaches
want to be football coaches, to be in the offensive and defensive
meetings and call their own plays. If you're not careful, you can
get separated from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed a great deal. But there's been no surprises. I
had an idea how it would be being under Tom for 19 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would seem the best preparation for the job and the
burden that comes with it. At least that's what the Nebraska
prophets keep reminding him.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Russia in economic freefall and only four days
before a planned summit meeting between President Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, U.S. officials said Thursday that
Clinton would go to Moscow with words of encouragement but no new
money.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were hastily rewriting the summit script even as
they scrambled to devise a longer-range plan to prepare for a
Russia without Yeltsin, who has been the focus of U.S. policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration talked Thursday of creating new
policies for a new Russia, the United States seemed to be watching
the events from the sidelines and with a hesitation that contrasted
with the quickly offered monetary aid and statements of assurance
that have met earlier, less serious, crises in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have no new answers to Russia's
political and financial crises, and no new money to provide beyond
what the International Monetary Fund has already pledged, and
Clinton has already told that to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not hit the ground with a bag of tricks,'' a senior
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting this sense of uncertainty, a senior U.S. official
for the first time suggested that the summit meeting might be
delayed or canceled, after days of insistence that it would take
place as scheduled despite the lack of a functioning government in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The official, describing the situation in Russia as ``extremely
fluid,'' said that the administration was watching news reports
with one eye and the financial ticker with the other. As rumors of
Yeltsin's imminent resignation swirled, the value of the Russian
currency tumbled and the Dow Jones industrial average was down for
a time by more than 350 points.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel Berger repeated the
administration position that the U.S.-Russian relationship was
built on policies, not personalities. Echoing Clinton's comments to
Yeltsin in a telephone call Tuesday, Berger urged the Russian
president and his acting premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to continue
on the path of economic reform laid out by the previous government
of Sergei Kiriyenko, whom Yeltsin sacked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the composition of the government is obviously for the
Russians to decide,'' Berger said during a briefing on the
apprehension of two suspects in the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in
Africa. ``What we were _ what we are concerned about and would be _
are extremely interested in is the policy direction that the new
government takes. Does the new government stay essentially on
course with respect to economic reform and with respect to
democracy, or does it change course? If it changed course in any
kind of fundamental way, that would be of serious concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger was the only senior U.S. official to address the Russian
crisis on the record Thursday, a sign that the administration was
mystified by developments in Moscow and uncertain what to say about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored reporters' shouted questions about Russia during
a visit to Worcester, Mass., for a speech on education policy, and
later lashed out at staffers for not adequately briefing him on the
situation or preparing him for questions on it.
</P>
<P>
   But one White House aide said it was unlikely that Clinton would
have said anything Thursday on the unraveling situation in Russia
in any case, for fear of roiling financial markets and adding to
the instability in Moscow. ``Anything you say, the words get parsed
beyond all belief,'' the official said. ``You say something and it
gets picked apart, and it means whatever investors want it to
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a detailed briefing book for the summit at his
vacation home on Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday night, but it was
not clear whether he had yet read it. Glyn Davies, the executive
secretary of the National Security Council, flew to the island
earlier this week to help prepare Clinton for next week's summit
and to brief him on developments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with British Prime Minister Tony Blair late
Thursday afternoon about the Russian crisis and Clinton's visit to
Ireland and Northern Ireland next week, immediately following his
two days in Moscow. The two leaders agreed that continued economic
reform in Russia is ``vital,'' a British spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers returned early to
Washington from vacation to oversee economic preparations for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was in Moscow in a
series of urgent last-minute meetings to try to salvage some
concrete results from next week's meeting and to gauge the climate
for U.S.-Russian relations in months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's departure could certainly scotch plans for the summit,
but U.S. officials discounted reports that he was preparing to step
down. ``Obviously, the situation is tumultuous and day-to-day,''
one administration official said. ``We've heard the rumors, but no
one has given us any hint as of yet that there is a change'' in
Yeltsin's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still our expectation that the summit will go forward and
be productive,'' this official said
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the impending summit is a gift for U.S. officials.
It gives them a short-term event to focus on and allows them to put
off for another day the far more difficult question of how to deal
with a foundering and virtually bankrupt nation that possesses
thousands of nuclear weapons. Discussion of those questions has
been put on hold, one official said, until it is clear who will be
running Russia next week _ and after.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear is whether the IMF will deliver the next $4.3
billion payment of a loan package, due Sept. 15. It depends on
Russian legislative action to reform the tax and pension systems _
votes that look increasingly unlikely. The Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, must first confirm Chernomyrdin as prime minister, and
the debate could be contentious and long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot save Russia, only Russia can do that,'' a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president can't calm the markets,'' he said. ``The markets
will be affected only by clear evidence of Russian seriousness of
purpose, from Yeltsin to the Duma, to fix the problems and ensure
that foreigners get a fair shake. But Clinton can engage Yeltsin in
a discussion of the political imperatives of handling the
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone call to Yeltsin on Tuesday, Clinton pushed him in
that direction, an official said. ``Both Presidents reaffirmed the
importance of a clear, decisive strategy for tackling Russia's
economic crisis,'' said Barry Toiv, deputy White House spokesman.
``President Yeltsin stressed that this will be the top priority of
the new Russian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials, in a sign that they believe the Yeltsin
era is all but over, see the summit as a way to begin to build
bridges to the next generation of Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main public address of the two-day summit _ a speech
next Tuesday to students and young business leaders _ is an
explicit effort to speak over the heads of Russia's current leaders
to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will speak about the evolving relationship between the
countries and offer sympathy for the pain of the transformation
Russia is now suffering through, an official involved in summit
preparations said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton is scheduled to meet a dozen or more
parliamentary and regional leaders, another effort to engage with a
new generation of leaders not tainted by the Communist era or the
difficult transitional years of Yeltsin's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy in the United States and in Russia have
often questioned what they call Clinton's overly close relationship
with Yeltsin, ignoring other potential Russian leaders.
Administration officials respond that presidents deal with
presidents, that Russia has only one president at a time, and that
U.S. officials are in contact with Russian politicians at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Reddaway, a Russia scholar at George Washington
University, said he thinks Clinton should cancel his trip, in part
because there will be no one of real authority to engage, and in
part because Clinton may be greeted with ``nasty demonstrations or
comments'' from Russians who resent his close relationship with
Yeltsin, whom many Russians revile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish to undertake any initiative, political or
economic, in this volatile situation,'' Reddaway said. ``You can't
have a serious negotiation because there's no real government, and
it's hard to have negotiations with a president who may not be
there for more than a few weeks.''

 &HT;    Deacs sense light at end of tunnel
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Until this year, a phrase containing Wake
Forest and winning football could have been considered an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   But things seem to be changing for the ACC's perennial doormat.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons finished last season 5-6, but four of their losses
came in games in which they were leading at halftime. They were, at
least, competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, we could have been 8-3 last year,'' said tight
end Joe Zelenka, who at 6-5, 275, is the lightweight on what is the
league's biggest offensive line. Across the front, Wake goes 310,
310, 301, 328 and 305.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons also sport one of the best passing combos in the ACC
in senior quarterback Brian Kuklich and wideout Desmond Clark. In
fact, Clark needs 37 receptions to become the conference's all-time
leading receiver; he caught 72 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Clark also is one of the largest split ends in
captivity (6-3, 252) gives him an incredible advantage over
cornerbacks. In '97, Kuklich passed for 2,130 yards in just nine
games, while Clark's 72 catches went for 950 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough around here my first year because we went 1-10,
and although we were just 3-8 my second year, I began to sense
something, I began having the same vision as coach (Jim)
Caldwell,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell's vision seemed to dim with all the losing in his first
five seasons. The 14-41 won-lost mark is the worst in the
conference But Caldwell's persistence seems on the threshold of
paying off. Maybe nothing reflected it more than Sports Illustrated
magazine picking the Deacons as the No. 22 team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are higher than that,'' Caldwell said.
````They have always been higher. But we have not reached the
pinnacle by any stretch of the imagination. The proof is in the
pudding, and we still have got to get out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Caldwell's goals for this season was to shore up what was
an anemic running game in '97 when Wake finished with the
12th-worst rushing attack in the country. ``We'll be better running
the football,'' he predicted, ``but we're not a running football
team. We're a passing team, but a lot of our passes are short,
controlled passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior tailback Morgan Kane has gained 935 yards his first two
years, and with senior Wande Shaw leading the blocking at fullback
behind their mammoth line, Caldwell should be able to order up more
running plays.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, look for Wake to be as good at stopping the run as
it was last season, when the Deacs allowed only 96.1 yards per
game, the 10th best mark in the land. Eight defensive starters come
back to furnish the needed experience. Linebackers Kelvin Moses and
Dustin Lyman are excellent, and the Wake secondary is stable and
quick with Dameon Daniel, DaLawn Parrish and Jeffrey Muyres
returning as starters. Muyres is the brother of Tech wideout Jon
Muyres.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons' schedule also might help. With games against Air
Force, Navy, Clemson, Appalachian State, Duke and Maryland through
Oct. 17, Wake conceivably could be 6-0 when it plays North Carolina
on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Wake has not had a winning season since 1992, and, while this
team is better than any other during Caldwell's regime, it still
has to show it on the field.

 Intel's Dream Factory   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 Hillsboro, Ore.  
 
The research labs at Intel's Oregon headquarters look a lot like
the rest of Intel: long stretches of bland gray cubicles set neatly
atop acres of bland gray carpeting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that boring grayness disguises the cutting-edge computing
taking place in these cubicles. Here in the Intel Architecture
Labs, industry standards are born and shaped, video-conferencing
inches closer to becoming an everyday reality and an ambitious
effort is under way to turn the average home into a wired,
thinking, acting computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel Architecture Labs, which are content to operate
quietly in the background, vaulted into the news this week when a
report surfaced that research conducted there apparently upset
Microsoft a few years ago _ enough that Microsoft's reportedly
angry rebuke to Intel now is part of the government's antitrust
case against the Redmond, Wash., software giant. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The 450-person lab represents Intel's effort to push computing
forward _ which, though it sounds noble on the surface, is really
about driving demands for more and more of the microprocessors
Intel makes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Intel controls more than 85 percent of the market for
microprocessors _ the brains that run a personal computer _ the
company can't grow by stealing market share from its competitors.
Therefore, the labs' mission is to grow the market by creating new
reasons for people to want PCs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Intel takes a pretty broad view of the market and
understands their continued success depends on market growth, and
market growth depends on new applications,'' said Nathan Brookwood,
a chip analyst with Dataquest in San Jose. ``It's not leaving
things to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, most people don't need an ultrapowerful Intel
chip. People use their PCs for word processing, for crunching
spreadsheets and for surfing the Internet. Most of those functions
can be handled just fine on the chips available in today's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the world doesn't have the sense of urgency that
Intel has to buy better PCs,'' said Craig Kinnie, an Intel vice
president and the director of the labs. ``We want people to do
video-conferencing as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Mike Feibus, principal analyst with Mercury
Research, a market research firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., the question
for the Intel researchers is: ``How will they return us to the days
of the $2,500 PCs?''
</P>
<P>
   About the most futuristic research in the works at Intel's
Oregon facilities is what the company calls the ``Anywhere in the
Home'' initiative, which is looking at ways to wire the house. Even
the wildest components of that program are only about five years
from implementation, said Ed Arrington, the initiative's manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a video that Intel produced to show where things may be
headed, a man tells a panel by his bed, ``Put the house to sleep,''
and doors lock, lights shut off and alarms arm themselves. When the
man's young son breaks a glass during a midnight kitchen raid, mom
sees him on a bedside monitor and tells him to clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   When the man shaves in the morning, sports highlights pop up on
a screen in his bathroom mirror. Mom leaves video messages for the
kids in a refrigerator monitor. When their daughter wants to bake a
birthday cake for grandma, she touches hypertext recipes on a
tabletop panel; when she picks one, the oven turns itself on.
</P>
<P>
   When the little brother spills the batter on the monitor, the
kids only have to run it under the faucet to clean it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's preventing this is the expense of displays,''
said Arrington. ``So we said, `What would you do in the home
environment if displays were really cheap? You could make the whole
front of the fridge a display design. ... And how practical does it
have to be at home? Can you run it under water and wash it off?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We need things convenient,'' Arrington said. ``We don't want
to change our lifestyles to match the technology. We want to change
the technology to match our lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideas don't necessarily start with computer engineers
crunching code and playing with wires. Intel employs a team of
psychologists who study how people lead ordinary lives. They then
brainstorm how computers may be put to use in daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an anomaly for Intel,'' said Chris Riley, a
psychologist at the lab. ``We are not technologists. We are social
scientists. We study end-user environments _ not computer use, not
technology use, but the way people work and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, 49, wears jeans and Birkenstocks in the labs' casual
environment. Six of eight people in her group have doctorates;
after earning her Ph.D. at Princeton University, Riley spent 18
years working at Bell Labs in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that she and her colleagues bring a critical
element to the company. She says they're helping Intel think
``outside the box,'' and while that's become a common cliche among
management consultants, Riley notes that at the company famous for
the slogan ``Intel Inside,'' she means the phrase quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   Riley likens her work to Margaret Mead ``going out and living
with the natives.'' In this case, however, she doesn't have years
to research and report back. ``Intel's not patient enough to send
someone out for two years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she and her colleagues watch children at playgrounds or
interview people in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   That's where ideas like the wired refrigerator originate. ``This
is the information center of the home, not the PC, which is off in
the den,'' Riley said. ``Where do people congregate, do
calendaring, messaging? It's all in the kitchen, and it doesn't
work very well. So we say, `Aha! Computing can work with this real
well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The engineers sometimes are skeptical of the ethnographers'
work, but often, they can relate. ``Young engineers here say,
`Yeah, when I'm home, that's me,' '' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers work not only with the psychologists, but also
with other companies that ultimately might use Intel's chips.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Attaran, 36, a technical marketing engineer, collaborates
with broadcasters and broadcast equipment-makers on creating ways
to bring the PC and the TV set closer together. Attaran works in an
area called ``The Grove,'' a section of cubicles where the
fabricated walls have been removed and banks of televisions,
recorders and other electronic devices are installed in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove took its name from the tall potted plants that once
decorated the area.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are gone, and it's probably not too outlandish to
think that The Grove should refer to Andy Grove, the Intel chairman
who established the labs in 1991 to respond to ``a vacuum of
leadership in the PC industry,'' according to lab director Kinnie.
</P>
<P>
   The labs were set up in Oregon because most of the engineers
doing related work already were there, said Kinnie, 51, a 23-year
veteran of the company who was tapped to head the project. The labs
are named for the chip architecture that Intel pioneered and still
controls (More information about the labs is on the World Wide Web
at &LR;  developer.intel.com/ial &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Intel anticipates spending $2.8 billion this year on research
and development. Most of that money will go into chip design; Intel
wouldn't release the specific amount spent on the Oregon lab.
</P>
<P>
   Intel built its labs on a different premise than the more-famous
industrial R&AMP;D centers, such as Bell Labs or Xerox PARC in Palo
Alto. While those facilities hired top-notch scientists and gave
them free rein, Intel _ following an industry trend _ has more of a
focus on developing products it can use in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done until there are products out there,'' Kinnie
said. ``It was frustrating in the early years to get engineers to
think that way. They like to play with technology and then move on
to something else. ... I'm doing what's practical and pragmatic.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
FOR a starting pitcher, the number is 20 _ as in wins. Closers
shoot for 40 saves. Hitters have their sights set on a .300
average.
<TEXT>
<P>
   None of those individual accomplishments may be as significant
as the number the Astros have to shoot for over the final 28 games,
beginning tonight against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice. It's round. And it's reachable for the Astros, who
need 17 more victories to join an elite group of teams that have
won 100 or more games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred wins pretty much says you've got a team that
deserves a special place in the history of this game,'' general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``It's something that doesn't happen
very often. It's a plateau that distinguishes that particular team
as one of the better teams throughout the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great goal to shoot for, and I think this club
has that type of ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering 1998, only 75 teams teams had won 100 games in season
since 1901. Only 12 have done it since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are on pace to finish with exactly 100 wins while the
Yankees, Braves and Padres are on pace to surpass the 100-victory
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   If all keep up the pace, it would mark the first time in
major-league history four teams have won at least 100 games. The
Royals (102), Phillies (101) and Yankees (100) hit the century mark
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' Astros left fielder Moises Alou said of
winning 100 games. ``I think we can do it, and I think we're going
to do it. If things keep going the way they're going and if
everyone stays healthy, I think we're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to this team, I never thought we'd win 100
games. What's happening to this team right now is it's just a great
team getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it takes awhile for a team to get used to each
other. Now, we know how to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou is familiar with what it takes to put together a special
season after spending 1997 with the World Series champion Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the Astros compare to that team, which won 97 games
and entered the postseason as a wild card, Alou said: ``I think
we're just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who won the National League Central last season
before being swept in the first round of the playoffs by the
Braves, are just one victory shy of their 1997 total with a month
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker's offseason mission was to make improvements that
would help the Astros reach the next level. On that score, so far,
so good.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Alou and center fielder Carl Everett to the lineup has
given the Astros more offensive weapons than they have ever had.
Acquiring Randy Johnson _ who will start against the Pirates
tonight _ provides a bona fide staff ace, someone who can anchor
the playoff rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one big difference this year is that we're not as
dependent on one or two guys offensively,'' Hunsicker said.
``Because of that, our percentage has gone way up as far as hitting
in the clutch. Last year, we were not a very good team in one-run
games or in terms of coming from behind or scoring runners from
third base with less than two out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those are key areas that are critical in putting
together a championship-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very mediocre in that area last year. This year has
been a different story. We're not dependent on the same people
every day. We have the kind of lineup where if you're an opposing
pitcher, you can't take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are hitting .293 with runners in scoring position
this season compared to .258 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They have 38 come-from-behind victories, 22 in their last
at-bat. They are 24-15 in one-run games, a major improvement over
last season when they were 19-25 _ second-worst in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always set your goals higher than the year before,''
Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros reach 100 wins, they will break the club record
for victories (96 in 1986) and open the debate as to whether this
is the best team in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker has been part of the organization almost
from its inception, making him as qualified as anyone to make that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' he said. ``I think we've had better pitching
(in other seasons), but I don't think we've ever had a better
combination of hitting, fielding and baserunning speed. Right now,
that (100 wins) is a possibility, but I don't consider it a goal.
If we get closer to it, I will consider it a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to beat the record of the 1986 team, and 100 would
put the icing on it. To win 100 games takes a lot of consistency.
You have to have a few winning streaks, and you can't afford to
have any losing streaks. I don't think it's as satisfying if you
don't win in the postseason, but I still think it's an
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' longest losing streak is four games. They have had
winning streaks of eight, seven and five (twice).
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to do is win our division,'' first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``Secondly, we have a chance to have the
first- or second-best record (in the NL), and if we can do that,
that's obviously going to be beneficial to us because we'll get to
play two home playoff games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see that more than I'd like to see us win 100
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it would be nice to win 100 games because people
would be saying we're a great team. But we already know we're a
great team in the history of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes 100 games to get into first or second place,
that's great. But that's not our first goal.''

YOUTH MARCH ORGANIZER TAUNTS GIULIANI

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after a judge ruled that the rally called the
Million Youth March could proceed next weekend in Harlem, the chief
organizer attacked New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for trying to
block the event, calling him ``an ordinary cracker'' who ``chose to
ignore the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday before reporters and about 20 supporters,
organizer Khalid Abdul Muhammad said he wanted young black people
who attended to be courteous and respectful. He said that above
all, the march would be a show of ``love and unity among black
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Muhammad took every opportunity during his 30-minute speech
to bait Giuliani, who has condemned him for making numerous
anti-Semitic and anti-white remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to be afraid of Rudy Giuliani any longer,''
Muhammad said, speaking at Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem. ``This
cracker knows the law, but he chose to ignore the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was uncharacteristically silent after the speech,
refusing to discuss it during an afternoon news conference at City
Hall. But the city pressed on in its battle to stop the march,
asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the
decision of Judge Lewis Kaplan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
A three-judge panel will hear arguments on Tuesday, said Florence
Hutner, an assistant corporation counsel for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the city rejected Muhammad's request for a
permit to hold the march in Harlem, scheduled for Sept. 5, saying
the neighborhood could not safely accommodate the thousands
expected. The conflict has since become increasingly bitter, with
each side accusing the other of racism and the organizers finally
suing the city.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and other organizers have billed the march _ actually a
stationary rally _ as an opportunity for black youth to unite and
hear speeches about issues that affect them, like police brutality,
racism, unemployment and drug abuse. They have invited young black
people from around the country, but they now say attendance will be
nowhere near the million people originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday, Muhammad praised Kaplan for ruling that
the city's actions had violated the constitutional rights of the
organizers. But he went on to say that he did not believe in the
Constitution, and that it was not ``worth the paper it's printed
on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He also criticized black politicians who have expressed
reservations about the event. Several, including state Sen. David
Paterson and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, have asked why organizers
did not consult Harlem residents before planning the event, and
whether it will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand up, be strong again,'' Muhammad said, addressing black
elected officials who have criticized the march, none of whom
attended the speech. ``Stop flip-flopping on the side of the youth
one day, then against them the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterson issued a statement asking march organizers to avoid
making ``bigoted'' remarks and to focus instead on problems facing
black youth.
</P>
<P>
   But Muhammad shrugged off the request, saying he could not make
such a guarantee. ``How are we going to prepare our youth,'' he
said, ``if we don't tell our youth who are our oppressors?''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his attacks, Muhammad said Giuliani ``never would've
told Jewish youth in Crown Heights they couldn't march.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani would not respond to the speech, he did speak
out against the march earlier Thursday at a news conference in the
Bronx. ``For the life of me, I can't figure out why people would
voluntarily join a hate march,'' he said. ``The person running this
march has said the most hateful things that I have heard in this
city in maybe a couple of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said
the march would severely strain police resources, since it falls on
the busy Labor Day weekend. The West Indian Day Parade alone,
scheduled to take place in Brooklyn on Labor Day, will require the
supervision of at least 3,000 officers, he said. Safir said the
department had started planning for the march, but that he did not
yet know how many officers would be needed. Because many officers
are on vacation that weekend, it will be difficult to find enough
to cover two events, even though they are on different days, he
said.

 MOSCOW: President Clinton.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual move that spoke volumes about Yeltsin's diminished
authority, it was Yastrzhembsky who went to the parliament on
Thursday and spent three hours in conference with the chief of
Russia's Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov. The focus of their
discussions was a draft document which demands that the president
cede his considerable powers to appoint and fire governments and
sign economic decrees, and yield them to the parliament, or Duma,
now dominated by the Communist Party-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the document would commit the Duma to support
Chernomyrdin as prime minister, stop impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin, impose a moratorium on no confidence votes against
the government and pass a law on ``social guarantees'' for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The political document _ devised as an informal treaty between
the Kremlin, the Duma and the Russian government _ would circumvent
the Russian constitution, forcing Yeltsin to become little more
than a ceremonial head of state, with powers similar to Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a well-informed Russian journalist, Yastrzhembsky
told Zyuganov on Thursday that the president will refuse to sign
the document. Zyuganov, in turn, said that without the president's
signature, the parliament will not confirm Chernomyrdin as prime
minister at a session now scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments after the meeting, Yastrzhembsky said only
that the political document, and the separate draft program for a
radical change in the country's economic course, ``constitute a
basis for compromise.'' Zyuganov hinted that negotiations are not
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential camp is now aware of what is happening in the
country and now that they understand reality, consultations may
become more productive,'' he said, noting in other comments that
the president's future ``social welfare'' was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies, Yeltsin's resignation before his term expires in
2000 is `'definitely under discussion, but the issue is when, and
with what mechanism.'' Markov said Yeltsin's primary concern will
be a guarantee that he and his family will be immune from any
future prosecution, which could arise on a list of charges,
including treason, included in articles of impeachment now being
discussed in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   `'But,'' said Markov,''Boris Yeltsin can only resign if he sees
that Mr. Chernomyrdin controls the situation.'' Markov and other
political analysts say pressure on Yeltsin to resign is probably
coming from advisers who want to see Chernomyrdin _ whom Yeltsin
has already anointed as his successor _ run for president in early
elections, before he is too badly tarnished by the economic crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But other analysts cautioned that most resignation scenarios now
spinning wildly on Moscow's rumor mill lack any hard information
about Yeltsin's own intentions. `'We don't know what the president
thinks about it,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the
Politica Foundation. `'There is alot of talk about this
resignation, but no one is sure if he is well informed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Everything is up to Yeltsin,''said Pavel Voshchanov, a
journalist who was the Russian president's press spokesman during
the 1991 coup. `'The situation in the Kremlin is in complete
disarray, almost everyone has left him. He is in a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, who heads a party that has opposed Yeltsin's
policies but supports economic reform, said in a radio interview
that Yeltsin has to come forward with an explanation for his
decision to rename Chernomyrdin as prime minister, five months
after he fired him. `'If the Chernomyrdin appointment implies early
elections, let us hear this,'' said Yavlinsky in an Echo Moskvy
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that Chernomyrdin, faced with a fast
deteriorating economic situation, is ready to compromise with the
parliament, and its Communist-dominated majority, and even accept
its draft economic program. He is also expected to agree on naming
several Communists to his cabinet, although both sides may agree
that their ministerial portfolios should be limited to second-tier
positions, such as agriculture or culture.
</P>
<P>
   `'What Mr. Chernomyrdin needs most is early approval by the
Duma,'' said Nikonov, `'which is why he will sacrifice many things.
He also wants to spread responsibility as widely as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft document, now headed for discussion, would reverse a
seven-year- long economic reform program which has been based on
mass privatization and tight monetary policies. Instead, it calls
for increased government management of the economy, protection of
the banking system and support for Russian industry _ policies that
would necessarily require a mass infusion of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the program on Thursday, the parliament's deputy
speaker, Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's
party, Our Home is Russia, agreed that the program would require
money, ``but not a Niagara Falls of worthless rubles that will
inundate the economy and spur hyper-inflation.'' He described the
program as a compromise document, with proposals advanced by the
leftist opposition that is `'quite civilized and reasonable, not
extremist at all.''

EDDIE SHIPSTAD, 91, SKATER AND FOUNDER OF TOURING ICE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Shipstad, a onetime Minnesota rink rat who learned early
that a little fancy skating would attract a crowd on the ponds of
St. Paul, then made a fortune proving that a lot of fancy skating
would draw throngs across the country, died on Aug. 20 at his home
in Los Angeles. He was 91 and a founder of the Shipstad and Johnson
Ice Follies, the first of the traveling extravaganzas on ice.
</P>
<P>
   There were ice shows before Eddie Shipstad came along with his
comic skating partner, Oscar Johnson, and his top-hatted little
brother, Roy Shipstad, but until the three put their show on the
road in 1936, ice shows tended to be small one-shot amateur charity
productions, entertainment between periods at hockey games or
occasional nightclub engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how popular traveling ice shows became, it's a
wonder nobody had thought of them before. Somebody undoubtedly had.
The logic was compelling. Like circuses, an ice show that would
quickly run out of potential customers in a given city could find
an endless supply of fresh audiences simply by moving from city to
city.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike circuses, which had catered to loyal audiences since
the 19th century, ice shows were new, and when they came of age in
the Depression, entrepreneurs were reluctant to find out if a
traveling ice show was worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who knew if ice shows would attract enough paying
customers to justify the transportation and other costs?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Eddie Shipstad knew, and so did his friend, Oscar Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were children, the two had been giving impromptu
performances on frozen Minnesota rivers and ponds, sometimes
attracting so many fans that the police would be concerned that the
audience would plunge through the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Swedish immigrants, Shipstad, whose father worked at
a foundry in a job that barely brought in enough to feed his 10
children, began dreaming early on about the possibilities of
earning a living from skating.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that he was not good enough for a professional hockey
career, he concentrated on his athletic stunts and fancy skating
skills, teaming up with Johnson to work out elaborate comic skits.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Shipstad's brother Roy, the young men haunted local
rinks, sweeping the ice in exchange for skating time.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s the pair had attracted such local renown that
they were hired to perform at St. Paul hockey games, which led to a
five-year stint at Madison Square Garden, where they entertained
fans at Ranger games by, among other comic turns, using a simple
blanket to transform themselves into a skating horse, with Shipstad
gamely bringing up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of their success in New York, the Shipstad brothers
and Johnson recruited other skaters in 1935 to put on a show at the
St. Paul Auditorium that became the model for the Follies the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   After what turned out to be a 16-month engagement at the Sherman
Hotel in Chicago (after the performance, the ice would be covered
with a plywood dance floor), they had enough money to mount a show
and take it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when arena managers were desperate for attractions,
their timing proved perfect, but not right away. Their first stop,
in Tulsa, Okla., coincided with a local polio epidemic and drew
such a small audience that after counting the meager house, Johnson
delivered a famous reassurance to the nervous troupe. ``Don't
worry,'' he said, ``We've got them outnumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, however, the Follies were packing them in at
every stop, delighting audiences with a fast-paced show featuring
elaborate costumes, daring stunts, elegant ice dances, Roy Shipstad
as a top-hatted soloist and a show-stopping number in which Johnson
and Shipstad performed a raucous skid-row routine as Spike McDuff (
Johnson) and Gashouse Annie ( Shipstad).
</P>
<P>
   The success led to a movie, ``The Ice Follies of 1939,''
starring Joan Crawford, James Stewart and Lew Ayres, along with the
Shipstads, Johnson and other Follies skaters.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was a flop, but the real Follies continued to be such
a sensational success that when the partners declined to form a
second company, arena managers spurred the creation of copycat
rival, the Icecapades, in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The partners stopped performing in the 1940s and sold the
Follies for $3.5 million in 1954. It was eventually absorbed by
Disney on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson died in the 1960s, and Roy Shipstad died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Shipstad is survived by three sons, Eddie, of Grand Rapids,
Mich., Bob, of Orcas Island, Wash., and Don, of Los Angeles; a
brother, George, of Los Angeles; nine grandchildren, and five
great-grandchildren.

FTC SAYS MERCK-MEDCO DEAL CUT COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that Merck &AMP; Co. had
reduced competition in the pharmaceuticals market for a time after
it bought Medco Containment Services, a managed-care drug sales
company, in 1993. Merck announced Wednesday that it had agreed to
antitrust safeguards requested by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said the new agreement, which would replace the terms
Merck accepted three years ago in settling a civil suit in
California, would insure that Merck and Medco did not revert to
earlier practices. Government regulators said such practices had
threatened to undermine competition. The California settlement
expired earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, Medco must offer a wide range of
products by all drug makers, on lists selected by independent
committees of doctors and pharmacists. Merck must maintain a fire
wall denying it access to marketing information that Medco gathers
about competing products.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care units like Medco and similar divisions of Eli Lilly
and SmithKline Beecham buy drugs at discount prices and push
doctors to prescribe them for members of health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Merck said the new agreement merely formalized policies that it
had followed since it bought Medco. A Merck spokesman said the only
change from the 1995 agreement was a provision that the selection
committees would ``give no preference to the products of Merck''
except on ``objective criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said
the new agreement committed Merck and Medco to maintain the
safeguards and barred any return to the favorable treatment that
the commission said Medco had given to Merck drugs on preferred
drug lists called formularies.
</P>
<P>
   Baer noted that Merck adopted the earlier safeguards in February
1995 in settling a civil suit brought by Bacon-Normandi Corp. on
behalf of pharmacies that objected to the Merck-Medco merger. The
three-year agreement ``was a little bit porous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medco spokesman Kevin Colgan said that only 38 of the 533
brand-name drugs on the preferred list had been made by Merck. Of
these, 40 were recommended for substitution as lower priced and as
effective or better than other products. He said only four such
drugs were made by Merck: Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug;
Prinivil and Prinzide for cardiovascular problems, and Timoptic XE
for glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's agreement binds Merck to provisions similar to those
accepted by Eli Lilly after it bought PCS Health Systems from
McKesson Corp. The Merck agreement would be for seven years after
formal approval by the FTC. SmithKline Beecham has a smaller market
share and is not considered a threat to competition, antitrust
experts said.

ADVERTISING: TRAVEL CHANNEL AND CONDE NAST TRAVELER TEAM UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading travel magazine is joining forces with a
cable television network devoted to travel for cross-media and
cross-marketing ventures that will include a prime-time travelogue
series.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is being formed between Conde Nast Traveler, the
monthly travel magazine published by the Conde Nast Publications
unit of Advance Publications in New York, and the Travel Channel,
the travel and tourism TV network now part of the Discovery
Networks unit of Discovery Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are being offered advertising packages by the new
teammates with print, television and Internet components.
</P>
<P>
   The combination is indicative of the growing eagerness among
media giants to link up and then entice advertisers to buy
increased amounts of time and space by promoting the benefits of _
yes, that dreaded word _ synergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, Conde Nast Traveler and the Travel Channel are
competitors because both are in the business of getting
travel-related companies to be among their advertisers,'' said Jay
Feldman, who joined the Travel Channel as senior vice president and
general manager in January after Discovery acquired 70 percent of
the network from Paxson Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was also a sense,'' he added, ``that there were
things we might accomplish together.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were already ties on the corporate level between the
magazine and the network. Advance is an owner of Discovery, along
with the Liberty Media Corp. unit of Tele-Communications Inc., Cox
Communications and Discovery chairman John Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the first significant news at Conde Nast Traveler
since Thomas Florio returned there as vice president and publisher
in May after being moved out of his job as president of The New
Yorker. Florio served as publisher at Conde Nast Traveler from 1986
until 1993, when he left to join The New Yorker, which, like the
travel monthly, is owned by Advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting in front of more people interested in travel
with Discovery, a gold standard in cable,'' said Florio, who joined
Feldman to discuss the plans for the venture at a dinner at the
trendy Mercer Kitchen restaurant in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The rate base for Conde Nast Traveler, the circulation
guaranteed to advertisers, is 750,000. The Travel Channel is
available in 18.5 million American households with cable
television, Feldman said, ``which we expect to grow to 40 to 50
million sometime in the next three years based on my belief in how
good our distribution operation is.''
</P>
<P>
   That reference was to the present availability of Travel Channel
siblings: the Discovery Channel, 74 million households; the
Learning Channel, 65 million households, and Animal Planet, 41
million households.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the collaboration between Conde Nast Traveler and
the Travel Channel will be ``Conde Nast Traveler Presents Amazing
Destinations,'' the travelogue series, which is scheduled to begin
on the network Sept. 28. The hourlong series, to be shown at 10
p.m., Eastern and Pacific times, Monday through Friday, will be
hosted by Thomas Wallace, editor in chief of Conde Nast Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on the cross-marketing packages'' that will
encourage marketers to advertise on the series as well as in Conde
Nast Traveler, Florio said. ``Last week, on the West Coast, as Tom
was filming his segments, we brought 30 advertisers to the set for
lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Another result of the venture will be a 60-minute special on the
Travel Channel based on the annual Conde Nast Traveler Readers'
Choice Awards. That program, to begin running Oct. 15, will promote
the November issue of Conde Nast Traveler, which will present the
11th annual winners of the awards. The awards, based on a poll of
40,000 of the magazine's readers, will also be featured for two
weeks on ``Travel Daily,'' a Travel Channel series.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advertisers that have so far agreed to become print,
television and online sponsors for the awards, Florio said, are:
Hilton Hotels Corp., the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Corp.,
Silversea Cruises, Visa U.S.A. and the tourism promotion
organizations of the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
the Dominican Republic and Hong Kong. The combined value of
marketers' commitments is in seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the `endemic' advertisers, the travel advertisers,
have tried the Travel Channel,'' Florio said. ``We'll bring them
some nonendemic, new advertisers like Lexus.'' Feldman said he
hoped the special would become an annual event like the awards.
adding, ``This cross-media partnership is really the beginning of
more opportunities to more effectively serve clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio's ebullience at the dinner ran counter to widespread
perceptions that his step back to Conde Nast Traveler was a step
down after The New Yorker, where he wrestled with advertising and
profitability challenges under the fierce scrutiny of the national
media as well as the chattering classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so much fun being back at this magazine,'' he said
when asked about his mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elated would be an understatement,'' he added, also offering
the words ``liberated'' and ``set free.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Florio's appearance was proof of an assertion Feldman
made at dinner, that ``travel is the way to relieve stress.''

DEMOCRATS IN N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE SEEK RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When the political season began, Republican state
Attorney General Dennis Vacco presented an enticing target for
Democrats. His poll ratings were lackluster, critics said he had
dismissed a corps of experienced lawyers in favor of
less-experienced ones with Republican ties, and he had been accused
of not being tough enough on tobacco companies and corporate
polluters.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that four Democrats immediately leapt into
the race for their party's nomination to unseat Vacco. But now, as
they enter the stretch toward the Sept. 15 primary, the Democrats
find themselves facing a huge obstacle: Few people are paying
attention to the race, and three of the four Democratic candidates
lack the money to mount the kind of aggressive advertising campaign
needed to get voters' attention.
</P>
<P>
   As Eliot Spitzer, one of the Democratic candidates, recently put
it while speaking to about 40 people at a candidates' forum at a
Queens synagogue: ``I've traveled more than 50,000 miles trying to
find a person who understands what the attorney general's office
does. It's amazing. I haven't found that person yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks to go before the primary, poll numbers indicate
that it could be won by any of the four candidates: Spitzer, a
lawyer in private practice; state Sen. Catherine Abate; former
Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell, or Evan Davis, who was counsel
to Gov. Mario Cuomo. This is apparently because many Democratic
voters do not seem to be paying enough attention to the race to
know who the candidates are, never mind which one they will choose,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sluggishness of the campaign, the stakes in the race
are considerable. The attorney general's office has a budget of
nearly $140 million and a staff of 450 lawyers who defend the state
from hundreds of lawsuits a year ranging from allegations against
government officials to accidents on state-owned properties. The
office is also charged with filing lawsuits on everything from
charities fraud and price fixing to abuses by health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet as they travel around the state, the candidates find
themselves having to stir up interest among voters, and in some
cases even educate them about the office. The other night at the
forum in Queens, Koppell, who has a gentle but tightly wound
manner, was more than a bit pleased that people had bothered to
show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general's race gets virtually no attention,'' he
lamented to the crowd before giving his stump speech on his
accomplishments during his stint as attorney general. ``So we
really appreciate that you're here to listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the seeming lack of interest has not slowed the candidates
down. Davis, the race's firebrand, has become a common sight on the
campaign trail. From his wheelchair (he was stricken with polio at
age 5), Davis rails, taking the same populist message to county
fairs, parades and nursing homes across the state: Politicians have
become too indebted to big donors, instead of to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a candidate of the establishment,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``The process stinks and it needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Abate, who has an earnest if sometimes aloof
manner, has given speech after speech before women's groups, gay
organizations, labor unions and other historically Democratic
organizations in an effort to stir up a strong primary turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, most experts say the winner of the primary
will need one crucial thing to challenge Vacco: cash. The
Republican incumbent has already raised more than $3.1 million and
will probably receive more from the state Republican Party should
he need it.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco also has name recognition that the Democrats lack,
although a recent poll showed that more than 40 percent of voters
surveyed had no opinion of him. He has also shown a talent for
getting good publicity on a variety of consumer-related issues. He
may even benefit from the coattails of the popular Republican
governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Democratic candidate in the best position to run a
well-financed campaign is Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer who
is an intense campaigner with a thundering voice. His campaign has
already raised $3.6 million, $3.1 million of it his own money. By
contrast, Koppell has raised slightly more than $1 million; Ms.
Abate, $713,000, and Davis, $531,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's campaign has already spent $2.6 million of his total,
much of it on television advertisements across the state that tout
his accomplishments as a prosecutor and his support for such
popular issues as cleaning up the Hudson River and mandatory AIDS
testing of rapists.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether Spitzer's advertising will give him
a significant edge. A recent poll by the John Zogby Group of New
Hartford, N.Y., showed that 57 percent of the voters surveyed said
they were still undecided, meaning that it is a wide-open race.
Spitzer had only a slight lead over his rivals, with 16 percent of
likely Democratic voters saying they supported him. Davis received
15 percent; Ms. Abate, 8 percent, and Koppell, 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's spending has emerged as a campaign issue, with his
Democratic rivals accusing him of using his wealth to buy the
election. They have been especially critical about the money he has
pumped into the campaigns of local Democratic leaders in the hopes
of getting their support in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, 39, has called the accusations absurd, saying the money
is intended to finance a get-out-the-vote effort that will
eventually be needed to mount a serious challenge against
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to spend my money in support of an ideology that I
believe in deeply,'' he said. ``I'm not beholden to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Spitzer's most vocal critics has been Davis, who has made
campaign finance reform the major theme of his campaign. Davis, who
was Cuomo's counsel from 1985 to 1991, is the only candidate who
has placed voluntary limits on his own fund-raising. He has refused
to take money from unions, corporations and political action
committees. And he has placed limits on the amount he will take
from individual donors _ $2,500 for the primary and $2,500 for the
general election, far less than the state limit of $13,000 for the
primary and $28,000 for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is 54 and lives in Westchester County, says that he
has chosen to run such an unorthodox campaign so he will not to be
beholden to any interest group. But his campaign has suffered from
the lack of a get-out-the-vote organization and of a strong
fund-raising base.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates, for their part, have been stressing
their long records in government. Ms. Abate, who is 50 and lives in
Greenwich Village, has touted her ample experience running large
agencies, including as Commissioner for both the New York City
Probation Department and the New York City Department of
Correction.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, she has picked up critical support from
a number of influential unions, including District Council 37, the
largest municipal workers' union in the state, and the Public
Employees Federation, a statewide union of state employees. Her
prospects are also bolstered because her base is in Manhattan,
where primary voter turnout has been traditionally high.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell, who is 57 and lives in the Bronx, points to his 23
years in the Assembly and the year he served as attorney general.
His colleagues in the Legislature chose him to take over as
attorney general in 1993 after Robert Abrams resigned to run for
the U.S. Senate. Koppell ultimately lost the Democratic nomination
for attorney general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His message has consistently been that he would use the office
to focus on cracking down on consumer fraud, corporate polluters
and civil rights violations, just as he said he did when he held
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell has picked up considerable support among his former
colleagues in the Assembly. But many political analysts question
the viability of his candidacy for one simple reason: He lost the
last time he tried to get the party's nomination.

EDITORIAL: ELIMINATING HIDDEN WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Americans of both parties rallied around President Clinton's
decision to launch military strikes against alleged terrorist
installations in Afghanistan and Sudan. But the administration's
refusal to share more information about its choice of targets and
timing is disturbing. By its excessive secrecy, Washington only
increases skepticism about its claim that the Shifa chemical
factory in Sudan was really producing nerve gas ingredients and
thus had to be destroyed to prevent new terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it has ``compelling'' evidence, in the form
of soil samples, for its claims about the Shifa factory. But until
it shares some of that evidence, legitimate questions can be asked
about the justifications given for the Sudan attack.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the soil samples contain Empta, a
chemical not found in nature and with no known uses outside the
manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX. But Washington will not
produce the samples or detailed results of its tests on the soil.
Sudanese authorities insist that the plant was used to produce
pharmaceuticals, noting that the U.N.sanctions committee had
authorized the Shifa factory to export veterinary medicine to Iraq.
The Sudan has invited an international mission to come and collect
its own soil samples.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also had trouble sustaining its original claim of
a direct financial link between the Shifa factory and Osama bin
Laden, the alleged master terrorist Washington accuses of
organizing this month's deadly bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. The administration has repeatedly contended
that it had to strike the bases in Afghanistan quickly to head off
new terrorist actions. But it has so far been unable to show any
clear connection between the Shifa plant and any specific terrorist
plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the plant was not an immediate threat, Washington should have
explored opportunities to resolve the Shifa question by diplomacy
before resorting to cruise-missile attack. Sudan has previously
acceded to U.S. requests, for example by expelling bin Laden in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   These uncertainties make it imperative that the soil samples,
test results and other aspects of the administration's case be more
widely shared. If Washington cannot be more forthcoming, it should
take up Sudan's offer to let international investigators examine
the Shifa site. Nerve gas components like Empta are long-lasting.
If they were in the soil two months ago, they are probably still
there.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the right to use military force against
factories and training camps where terrorist attacks against U.S.
targets are being prepared. But the administration owes it to world
opinion, and the American people, to demonstrate that it has chosen
its targets carefully.  &QL;

WHEN WILL MARIS' RECORD FALL? FOX WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Predicting when Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa could tie or pass
Roger Maris' home run record of 61 may be a job more suited for a
psychic friend than a TV executive. But on Monday and Tuesday, Ed
Goren, the co-executive producer of Fox Sports, huddled with
baseball executives to estimate when the network might pre-empt its
programming to show McGwire or Sosa swing for 61 or 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to be a part of history, everyone wants to say
he saw  &UR; the &LR;  home run,'' Goren said.
</P>
<P>
   But the scheduling is alive with dandy possibilities and no
certainties. ``It's awfully goofy,'' Goren added. ``McGwire went
two weeks without hitting a home run, then hit five or six in a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   One or both batters could stop in their tracks. Or both sluggers
could hit singles _ there would be suspense but no payoff. But what
if each man is poised to hit No. 61 or 62 on the same day, in games
scheduled for the same time, like on Sept. 20 or 22? Answer: carry
each game simultaneously on Fox, with more of the country getting
the game with the player set to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   Goren offered another scenario: ``Say McGwire gets 60 on a
Thursday. We do the game Friday. Sosa is at 58 and hits two on
Friday. Then McGwire hits one. One guy's at 61, the other's at 60.
The variables keep you up at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Once committed, how long do you stick with the chase and
pre-empt prime time? Two nights? Three? Fox has a network to run
and new episodes to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would have happened if Hank Aaron didn't hit his 715th
when he did?'' Goren asked. ``How long would NBC have gone before
they said uncle?''
</P>
<P>
   How often can you set aside commercials sold for entertainment
programming and market baseball spots on the fly to carry potential
history?
</P>
<P>
   So, Goren, Paul Beeston, Major League Baseball's president, and
Leslie Sullivan, baseball's vice president of broadcasting, pored
over schedule printouts. They focused on dates starting Sept. 10,
puzzling over which days were more suitable for Fox than others
(its strong prime-time schedules on Sunday and Monday are nights
the network would not prefer) and who else has broadcast rights to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday nights on Fox may be preserved for Bart Simpson and the
agents Mulder and Scully, but a potentially crucial Sunday _ when
St. Louis plays Houston on Sept. 13 _ opened up when baseball
wrested three Sunday night games from ESPN because ESPN was going
to shift them to ESPN2 in favor of National Football League games.
The other former ESPN baseball games are on Sept. 6 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will remain in the McGwire-Sosa fray. Its West Coast
doubleheader on Sept. 16 should feature the Cubs-Padres game from
San Diego. The only other West Coast game that night is Colorado at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Fox would love to commandeer any games now scheduled to
be shown by the team's local telecasters. It is likely that if Fox
wants to step in, local stations like the Cubs' WGN or the
Cardinals' KPLR would still carry the game in their markets and Fox
would take it nationally. But WGN would certainly have to black out
its superstation signal across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time doesn't present the only possibilities. Sosa and the
Cubs play six day games at Wrigley Field starting Sept. 10. One, on
Sept. 12, could be added to Fox's Saturday afternoon slate. The
others would require pre-empting children's programming on Fox
stations.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Goren said Fox will not do is follow one player if the
other has broken the record. ``This is already a stretch for a
network to commit to doing something like this,'' he said. ``The
magic number is 62. Once someone reaches it, in all fairness, we
have to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   But ... what if McGwire reaches 62 first, then Sosa ties and
passes him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't deal with that right now,'' Goren said.
</P>
<P>
   And what if Ken Griffey Jr. heats up? More possibilities. More
variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make it a trifecta,'' Goren said.

VICTORY GALLOP ADDS WEAPON FOR TRAVERS: FLEET STABLEMATE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Eight horses were entered Thursday for
Saturday's $750,000 Travers Stakes, including one unexpected rabbit
whose role was to wear down Coronado's Quest and set things up for
Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 3-year-olds were maneuvering for position for
their ``summertime Kentucky Derby,'' another little drama was
unfolding at Saratoga when the marquee star of the steeplechase
world, 10-year-old Lonesome Glory, ran sixth in the New York Turf
Writers Cup in the 41st start of his distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   The 129th Travers was shaping up as a major test in the rivalry
between Coronado's Quest and Victory Gallop, who ran 1-2 in the
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park last month and are battling
for the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, who skipped the Triple Crown but has won four
straight races, drew the No. 3 post and was quoted at 8-5 odds in
the early betting line. Victory Gallop, who ran second in the
Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Haskell and first in the Arkansas
Derby and Belmont Stakes, drew the No. 7 post, with his stablemate
Sheila's Flag just to his right on the outside, and was made the
fractional favorite at 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Victory Gallop wins the Travers, he should be the
3-year-old champion,'' said his trainer, Elliott Walden. ``He would
have raced in five Grade I's in a row, never finishing worse than
second. He would have won 4 of 7 starts. And he is still around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walden was taking no chances. He came up with a surprise
horse to join Victory Gallop as an entry: Sheila's Flag, with the
strict purpose of guaranteeing what Walden called ``plenty of
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, many racing people believe, could be the
distance: Victory Gallop won the Belmont at a mile and a half,
Coronado's Quest has never won at the Travers distance of a mile
and a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Deputy Diamond, put it:
``Pace will definitely make this race. If they let Coronado's Quest
get out there and set his own pace, believe me, he'll get the mile
and a quarter. I'm just hoping somebody keeps him honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``somebody'' was the rabbit. But Walden, having set up his
strategy, immediately hedged. He said that it had not yet been
decided whether Sheila's Flag would run and that one factor might
be the weather.
</P>
<P>
   James Bond, who won the Travers two years ago with Will's Way
and lost it last year by a nose with Behrens, suggested that
Coronado's Quest was a great horse at a mile and an eighth, ``but
he has never been a mile and a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Bond said. ``the million-dollar question for him is, can
he get the distance? And Victory Gallop is a horse that's certainly
tough, but how much did the Triple Crown take out of him?''
</P>
<P>
   On the inner grass stage at Saratoga, meanwhile, the jumpers
played the main event Thursday. And the 5-year-old Hokan not only
repeated the success he scored on opening day but also set a track
record. He ran the two and three-eighths miles in 4 minutes 12
seconds, slicing one-fifth of a second off the mark set by Eskimo
Cove in 1995 and edging Romantic by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional low came when Lonesome Glory could not crank up
his famous finishing kick, which won him the Eclipse Award four
times for steeplechase racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very big disappointment,'' said Bruce Miller, who
trains Lonesome Glory for Kay Jeffords. ``He got off to a terrible
start and never really got into the race. I see no reason not to
bring him back for the Colonial Cup, but I want to see if he's
fine. If there is a problem, we will have plenty of time to fix
it.''

LUCIC SAYS FATHER ABUSED HER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the Croatian teen-ager Mirjana Lucic accused
her father and coach, Marinko, of physically and mentally
terrorizing her for the past 10 years while grooming her for tennis
stardom, she has fled to the United States with her mother and four
siblings. Mirjana Lucic is, on the eve of the U.S. Open, seeking a
restraining order to prevent him from interfering with her when she
competes there next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic has told her management firm, Advantage International,
that she made her decision to leave her father and come to the
United States after they had a dispute during Wimbledon in which he
struck her and her mother, Anjelka.
</P>
<P>
   Besides physically disciplining her for any perceived setbacks
she had on the tennis court, where he had made it clear that she
should settle for nothing less than becoming the world's No. 1
player, Lucic has also alleged that her father and his nephew,
Milan Lucic, stole portions of her prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Lucic, ranked 50th in the world, made her
accusations in the Croatian newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija on Monday.
``There have been more beatings than anyone can imagine,'' she
said, adding that it was ``too dangerous'' for her to remain in
Croatia. She said that she also feared for the safety of her mother
and her older sister, Ana. The three other Lucic siblings are
younger than Mirjana.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that appeared Thursday in the Zagreb newspaper
Vecenji List, Marinko Lucic, a decathlete who competed in the
Olympics for the former Yugoslavia, denied beating or mistreating
Lucic as a reaction to poor tennis results. He insisted that she
was being manipulated by an unnamed third party with vested
interests in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used excessive force,'' Marinko Lucic wrote, ``and if
I did give her the occasional slap, it was because of her behavior;
I did what I believe was best for my child.'' He added that he
wanted her to become a role model like Pete Sampras, Steffi Graf
and Monica Seles _ all of whom have held the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Marinko Lucic, who composed his letter with the assistance of a
lawyer, Mate Matic, also denied that he and Milan Lucic had
wrongfully extracted money from his daughter. According to Marinko
Lucic, Milan Lucic, a wealthy businessman, had sponsored Mirjana
and supported the rest of her family, paying their living costs and
making repairs to their home in Makarska while she trained and
traveled on the junior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mirjana Lucic and her family arrived in the United States in
early July, and this month she played a tournament in San Diego.
She spent the past two weeks training for the United States Open at
the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton, Fla. She implied that
she plans to settle in the United States and said that the office
of Senator Alphonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, had assisted
her in obtaining travel visas for her family.
</P>
<P>
   This week Mirjana Lucic asked Ivan Brixby, her agent at
Advantage, to help her find legal assistance in New York,
presumably to facilitate a restraining order against her father.
``It's a very serious matter,'' Brixby said Thursday, ``and many
issues are still outstanding.''

MATADORS NOW BRADY'S BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge's quarterback of the future
just became the Matadors' quarterback of the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Brady, an 18-year-old redshirt freshman from San Diego,
will start CSUN's season opener at Boise State on Sept. 5, head
coach Ron Ponciano said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brady beat out three others, including junior Josh Fiske, who
opened camp as the No.1 quarterback and is the only one who's
started a game at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Josh had the experience, he was our No.1 quarterback
coming out of spring (camp),'' Ponciano said, ``but there has been
a swing in these last 15 practices. (Brady) has really taken a grip
of the offense.... He has showed a significant separation from the
other quarterbacks at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That fact became apparent last Saturday, when Brady outplayed
quarterbacks Fiske, David Lins and Mitch Ryerson in the team's
first full-speed scrimmage. Brady posted far superior ratings in
everything from completion percentage to decision making. He
sustained that level this week to cement his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready,'' said Brady, who turns 19 next month. ``I've
always been ready. This is like a dream come true. This is my
chance. I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, on the other hand, is reassessing his football future.
The backup to Aaron Flowers the past two seasons, and a starter for
three games in 1997, Fiske was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of boggles my mind a little bit,'' he said. ``After
spring (camp), coach Ponce told me I was the guy and it would be
hard for anybody to beat me out in fall. I would have to really
mess up, which I feel I haven't really done.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they told me and what they're doing now is totally
opposite.... If it was still open after spring, they should have
said that instead of telling me what they did.... They just played
games with my mind, it seemed like.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske admits he had a poor outing in the first scrimmage,
completing only 33 percent of his passes while Brady hit 83
percent. Fiske improved markedly in Wednesday's scrimmage but
apparently not enough to overtake Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I've been thinking the last couple days if I should
stick it out,'' Fiske said. ``I've been here for four years and
I've worked so hard to get to this point ... to become a starting
quarterback. Now that's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said the decision was based on Brady's clearly superior
performances to date. But he also won't hesitate to change
quarterbacks if Brady struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in every one of (the four quarterbacks),''
he said. ``Could Josh end up being the No.1 guy? Yeah but not right
now. He lost it to a guy that separated himself from the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he's not concerned about going into the season
with a rookie quarterback. ``Obviously it doesn't make a difference
on the practice field, and that's the only thing we can rate off
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, a former three-sport star at San Diego's Morse High,
succeeds Flowers, an All-American and the Matadors' all-time
leading passer. He inherits an offense that ranked No.1 in the
nation in passing yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, 185-pound Brady is a solid passer but is also the
Matadors' most mobile quarterback and will pose a double threat to
opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to prepare for him. He's a weapon,''
CSUN safety Vito Clemente said. ``If he gets out of the pocket,
he's dangerous.''

FREDERICK REINES, 80; NOBELIST DISCOVERED NEUTRINO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Frederick Reines, whose fine baritone might have landed him
in opera instead of the career in neutrino physics that culminated
in the 1995 Nobel Prize, died Aug. 26 at the University of
California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Calif. He was 80 and
lived at the university campus, where he was distinguished
professor emeritus in physics.
</P>
<P>
   The university said he died after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Described by other scientists as the father of neutrino physics,
Reines (pronounced RYE-ness) had a reputation as an intense
researcher, often ahead of others in anticipating important physics
problems and always relentless in solving them.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Reines and a colleague made the discovery that
eventually earned him the Nobel accolade.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, physicists predicted the existence of
neutrinos, virtually massless subatomic particles that move through
space and matter with so few interactions that their existence was
thought to be beyond detection. The theorists who predicted that
such ghostlike particles probably originate in nuclear reactions in
the Sun and in exploding stars despaired of ever discovering their
traces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, while at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New
Mexico, Reines decided to try the seemingly impossible: detect a
neutrino. It was typical of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always doing courageous things, expanding the limits of
research,'' said Dr. Jonas Schultz, another physicist at the Irvine
campus. ``He thought of ways to detect neutrinos, showed that it
could be done and that was a psychologically important breakthrough
in the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Dr. Clyde Cowan, a Los Alamos colleague, Reines
used a nuclear reactor to produce neutrinos and a tank of water as
the agent of detection. The impacts of neutrinos coming from the
reactor produced flashes of light in the water tanks, which the two
scientists recorded and reported in 1956. Scientists were surprised
that it took the Nobel Prize committee until 1995 to recognize the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dr. Myron Bander of Irvine said the neutrino
discovery was ``a keystone to our understanding of elementary
particle physics.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only last June that other scientists, using detectors in
Japan, finally determined that the neutrino does have some mass and
thus could contribute to the so-called dark matter that pervades
and shapes the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Reines was born on March 16, 1918, in Paterson, N.J.,
to parents who were immigrants from Russia. As a boy in upstate New
York and later in North Bergen, N.J., he enjoyed building things,
earning merit badges to become an Eagle Scout and singing and
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Even in college, at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken,
N.J., he took singing lessons from a voice coach at the
Metropolitan Opera and had solo roles in Handel's ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   But science won out, Reines said many years later, perhaps
because of an idle moment one afternoon in school. He was looking
out of the window at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed something peculiar about the light,'' he recalled.
``It was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a
fascination with light.''
</P>
<P>
   So he studied physics at Stevens and earned a doctorate at New
York University. Early in his career, he was part of the Los Alamos
team working on the atomic and hydrogen bombs. His first job was on
the theoretical staff headed by Dr. Richard Feynman, another future
Nobel laureate. Much of his research centered on the findings of
bomb tests on Enewetak and Bikini atolls in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1959, he headed the physics department at Case
Institute of Technology (now Case Western University) in Cleveland
for seven years. He said the ``peak of my musical endeavors''
occurred at this time, when he sang with the chorus of the
Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. Otherwise he confined his music to
some Gilbert and Sullivan performances and singing at parties.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues also recalled that Reines sometimes locked himself in
his office to work on particularly difficult physics problems. He
could be heard singing opera for hours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Reines became the founding dean of physical sciences at
the new University of California campus at Irvine. He later
returned to full-time teaching and research, heading a team of
neutrino scientists. The team's subsequent research on neutrinos
from supernova 1987A won the Bruno Rossi prize in high-energy
physics from the American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Reines married the former Sylvia Samuels in 1940, while he was
in college. She survives, as well as their two children, Robert G.,
of Ojo Sarco, N.M., and Alisa K. Cowden of Trumansburg, N.Y., and
six grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Pressure mounted on President Boris Yeltsin to cede
some of his powers or even step aside as Russia's political leaders
frantically negotiated over fundamental changes in the country's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Yeltsin's weakness, his political opponents pushed
for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of an uneven
transition to a democracy and market economy. They also proposed to
skirt the constitution by usurping some of the president's powers
and leaving him as a ceremonial head of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's future is so much in doubt here that rumors circulated
that he had signed an undated letter of resignation. While the
rumors were strongly denied by his spokesman, they seemed to
suggest a widening political vacuum in which an early resolution of
the crisis was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, almost nothing was settled, though
Yeltsin's choice for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, signaled
that he had prepared a plan to rescue the economy. He did not
provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the country has been shaken by a deepening financial
crisis in which the value of the ruble seems to be evaporating by
the hour. For the second day in a row, Moscow's currency exchange
shut down 10 minutes after trading showed the value of the ruble
heading for another precipitous plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank of Russia, its reserves already severely
depleted, gave up trying to defend the currency and announced on
Thursday that the currency exchange will remain shut `'for some
time,'' meaning that it is virtually impossible to buy dollars
here.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, speaking to reporters late Thursday evening, said,
``Now I finally have a clear picture of the situation and can say
it is indeed difficult but absolutely manageable. A series of
decisions have been taken after consulting Russia's best brains.
The main goal is to stop the ruble's fall, not allow the economy to
collapse and reduce the losses of every Russian from this financial
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking crisis claimed its first victim on Thursday, with a
move by the Central Bank to nationalize the country's second
largest bank, SBS-Agro, which is deeply in debt. More banks
announced on Thursday that they will consolidate operations to
survive and seek common shelter from angry creditors and customers.
</P>
<P>
   With trading of the ruble now suspended after it fell as low as
16 to the dollar, Russia's financial crisis has seeped deep into
the economy. There were scattered reports today of panic buying of
food, of stores shutting down as they await new prices and of a
spreading deadlock on payments from banks to their clients and from
employers to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a hasty trip on Wednesday to Ukraine where he met
with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Chernomyrdin
resumed talks with the Communist opposition over their demands for
an reversal of Russia's economic policies. Parliament's program,
released on Thursday, calls for a return to increased state control
over the economy, including the nationalization of strategic
industries. The Communist Party, now Russia's largest opposition
party, is also expected to press for a number of jobs in the
Chernomyrdin cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chernomyrdin nor the IMF would discuss their talks, but
it is clear that the fund would oppose any moves to reverse the
privatizations of state-run industries or other steps to undo
market reforms. Chernomyrdin clearly understands that any attempt
to do so would probably mean that the monetary fund would cancel
its loan agreement. How he will placate both the IMF and his
political opponents is unclear now.
</P>
<P>
   But looming over the future of the new government is the
uncertain future of Yeltsin himself, the man who has dominated
Russia's shaky democracy since its birth seven years ago. His
recent absence from the political scene, after Sunday's abrupt
change in government, has again fueled rumors of his early
resignation and deteriorating health. Pressed by rumors circulating
here and abroad that Yeltsin is ready to resign, Kremlin spokesmen
on Thursday repeatedly stated that such reports were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   `'The president's resignation has been and is out of the
question,'' Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
on Thursday night, after CBS reported that Yeltsin had agreed to
resign once Chernomyrdin is confirmed as prime minister by the
parliament ``I would like the Russian public, the Russian and
foreign media, to calm down,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin _ who since a televised statement Monday has appeared
only once this week to meet the visiting Vietnamese president _ is
due to meet on Friday with President Pyotr Stoyanov of Bulgaria,
and next week with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move that spoke volumes about Yeltsin's diminished
authority, it was Yastrzhembsky who went to the parliament on
Thursday and spent three hours in conference with the chief of
Russia's Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov. The focus of their
discussions was a draft document which demands that the president
cede his considerable powers to appoint and fire governments and
sign economic decrees, and yield them to the parliament, or Duma,
now dominated by the Communist Party-led opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the document would commit the Duma to support
Chernomyrdin as prime minister, stop impeachment proceedings
against Yeltsin, impose a moratorium on no confidence votes against
the government and pass a law on ``social guarantees'' for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The political document _ devised as an informal treaty between
the Kremlin, the Duma and the Russian government _ would circumvent
the Russian constitution, forcing Yeltsin to become little more
than a ceremonial head of state, with powers similar to Britain's
Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   According to a well-informed Russian journalist, Yastrzhembsky
told Zyuganov on Thursday that the president will refuse to sign
the document. Zyuganov, in turn, said that without the president's
signature, the parliament will not confirm Chernomyrdin as prime
minister at a session now scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments after the meeting, Yastrzhembsky said only
that the political document, and the separate draft program for a
radical change in the country's economic course, ``constitute a
basis for compromise.'' Zyuganov hinted that negotiations are not
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential camp is now aware of what is happening in the
country and now that they understand reality, consultations may
become more productive,'' he said, noting in other comments that
the president's future ``social welfare'' was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Studies, Yeltsin's resignation before his term expires in
2000 is `'definitely under discussion, but the issue is when, and
with what mechanism.'' Markov said Yeltsin's primary concern will
be a guarantee that he and his family will be immune from any
future prosecution, which could arise on a list of charges,
including treason, included in articles of impeachment now being
discussed in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   `'But,'' said Markov,''Boris Yeltsin can only resign if he sees
that Mr. Chernomyrdin controls the situation.'' Markov and other
political analysts say pressure on Yeltsin to resign is probably
coming from advisers who want to see Chernomyrdin _ whom Yeltsin
has already anointed as his successor _ run for president in early
elections, before he is too badly tarnished by the economic crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But other analysts cautioned that most resignation scenarios now
spinning wildly on Moscow's rumor mill lack any hard information
about Yeltsin's own intentions. `'We don't know what the president
thinks about it,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, director of the
Politica Foundation. `'There is alot of talk about this
resignation, but no one is sure if he is well informed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   `'Everything is up to Yeltsin,''said Pavel Voshchanov, a
journalist who was the Russian president's press spokesman during
the 1991 coup. `'The situation in the Kremlin is in complete
disarray, almost everyone has left him. He is in a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, who heads a party that has opposed Yeltsin's
policies but supports economic reform, said in a radio interview
that Yeltsin has to come forward with an explanation for his
decision to rename Chernomyrdin as prime minister, five months
after he fired him. `'If the Chernomyrdin appointment implies early
elections, let us hear this,'' said Yavlinsky in an Echo Moskvy
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that Chernomyrdin, faced with a fast
deteriorating economic situation, is ready to compromise with the
parliament, and its Communist-dominated majority, and even accept
its draft economic program. He is also expected to agree on naming
several Communists to his cabinet, although both sides may agree
that their ministerial portfolios should be limited to second-tier
positions, such as agriculture or culture.
</P>
<P>
   `'What Mr. Chernomyrdin needs most is early approval by the
Duma,'' said Nikonov, `'which is why he will sacrifice many things.
He also wants to spread responsibility as widely as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft document, now headed for discussion, would reverse a
seven-year- long economic reform program which has been based on
mass privatization and tight monetary policies. Instead, it calls
for increased government management of the economy, protection of
the banking system and support for Russian industry _ policies that
would necessarily require a mass infusion of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the program on Thursday, the parliament's deputy
speaker, Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of Chernomyrdin's
party, Our Home is Russia, agreed that the program would require
money, ``but not a Niagara Falls of worthless rubles that will
inundate the economy and spur hyper-inflation.'' He described the
program as a compromise document, with proposals advanced by the
leftist opposition that is `'quite civilized and reasonable, not
extremist at all.''

MARSHALL BARER, 75, LYRICIST FOR `MATTRESS' AND MIGHTY MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., N.M.)   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marshall Barer, the lyricist and book writer (with Jay Thompson
and Dean Fuller) for ``Once Upon a Mattress'' (the 1959 show that
introduced Carol Burnett to Broadway), and the wit who wrote the
words for the Mighty Mouse theme song, died Aug. 25 at his home in
Santa Fe, N.M. He was 75 and had lived for many years in Venice,
Calif., where his home had been an informal salon for West Coast
songwriters and performers.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said actor Brandon Maggart, a
longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattress,'' which had music by Mary Rodgers, was a farcical
adaptation of the popular fairy tale ``The Princess and the Pea.''
After running for 460 performances off and on Broadway it had two
successful television adaptations, both starring Ms. Burnett, and
went on to enjoy numerous local productions around the country. It
was revived last year on Broadway with Sarah Jessica Parker in the
leading role.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific songwriter whose work flourished in cabarets with the
support of performers like Michael Feinstein and Andrea Marcovicci,
Barer was a master of the witty revue song that satirized human
foibles and punctured cliches with a devilish insouciance. If none
of his songs was a bona fide hit, he was regarded by cognoscenti as
one of the finest exponents of a brittle late-1950s-early-'60s
style that carried clever lyrical observation to a peak of
refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his best-known song was probably the Mighty Mouse
cartoon theme, ``Here I Come to Save the Day.'' ``Some claim to
fame, huh?,'' Barer once said in an interview. ``I'm actually not
all that proud of it. I wrote it in the back of a taxicab.''
</P>
<P>
   Barer was born in Long Island City, Queens, New York City, and
began his career as a designer and illustrator for such magazines
as Esquire, McCall's and Seventeen. From there he branched out into
writing special material for performers, including Celeste Holm.
Moving into children's music, he worked as a staff composer for
Golden Records, collaborating with Alec Wilder, and in 1951 he
began collaborating regularly with Fuller. They wrote several
numbers for the Broadway revue ``New Faces of 1956.''
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the same team contributed three songs and a
sketch for the 1957 Ziegfeld Follies starring Beatrice Lillie.
``Once Upon a Mattress,'' which was nurtured at the Tamiment
Playhouse, the summer playhouse in the Poconos, followed in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1966, he and Ms. Rodgers re-teamed to write five songs in
``The Mad Show,'' the off-Broadway revue based on the humor
magazine that ran for 871 performances. The same year, he was
lyricist for an unsuccessful Broadway show, ``Pousse-Cafe,'' with
music by Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barer's most successful collaborations were with Ms.
Rodgers, he also worked with Leroy Anderson, J. Fred Coots, Hoagy
Carmichael, Burton Lane, David Raskin, Michel Legrand, Vernon Duke
and, most recently, Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Natalie Feingold, of Florida.

EDITORIAL: NEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE HARLEM MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has ruled that organizers of a Million Youth
March can use the streets of Harlem on Sept. 5. The decision was
unwelcome to the Giuliani administration, but Judge Lewis Kaplan's
decision did appear to reduce the chances of a worrisome
confrontation between police and marchers determined to take to the
streets without a permit. However, there are other safety issues
that still must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Youth project posed some sticky political, ethical
and legal issues for New York City. Spearheaded by Khalid Abdul
Muhammad, a freelance demagogue best known for his anti-Semitic
remarks, the project showed no signs of organization beyond a
glitzy web site. Given the fact that Muhammad and his minions said
they were going to attract one million or more young people, some
of them gang members, on the Labor Day weekend, one of the busiest
of the year, City Hall's offer of alternate sites at Randalls
Island or Van Cortlandt Park did not seem unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   When lawyers for Muhammad went to court, they reduced their
crowd estimates to about 175,000. That made it easier to argue that
the city would be violating their constitutional rights by banning
them from the streets. But the planning seemed as fuzzy as ever.
The march organizers have been claiming that famous rap artists
will entertain during the event. In theory, 20 sound trucks and
jumbo screens will broadcast their performances. But there is no
evidence that the screens or trucks exist. Recalling the fatal
stampede at a rap concert at City College a few years ago, state
Sen. David Paterson expressed concern that the same type of tragedy
could occur again.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson and other Harlem leaders who have denounced Muhammad
are nevertheless working hard on public safety issues. The city
must also use its diplomatic skills to insure safety, even if it is
operating under court order. Entertainers whose names have been
linked to the event without permission should tell their fans they
are not really planning to attend. Muhammad's haphazard planning
has put a heavy burden on everyone else to act responsibly.

PARCELLS KEEPS JETS ON THE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The tinkering with the New York Jets won't stop with
their final preseason game Friday night. Coach Bill Parcells admits
he remains uncertain about who is starting at three positions.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Parcells puts on a human face, when he
admits he is stumped or debates openly about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Was he planning to put rookie Kevin Williams at free safety
against the Chicago Bears just to give him a look?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's a real chance for him,'' Parcells said. ``I don't
know what I've got there.''
</P>
<P>
   What he may have is an extremely quick player with good moves _
on the first day of rookie camp he displaced the highly visible
Scott Frost as a free safety of the future. Each was chosen in the
third round.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, a quarterback for Nebraska, was taken first and was then
converted to safety. But he quickly started practicing at strong
safety when Williams, a cornerback out of Oklahoma State, displayed
classic free-safety technique.
</P>
<P>
   So after having Raymond Austin start the first three preseason
games, Parcells doesn't even plan to use Austin, who has been a
disappointment this summer, against the Bears. Instead, Williams
will share time with last year's starter, Jerome Henderson. But
Williams will get the bulk of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is such a talented athlete, that Parcells said, ``I may
have asked him to do too much.'' It was hard enough for Williams to
absorb the intricacies of football's ``center field'' at free
safety, but the Jets also used him to return a team-high seven
kickoffs, as well as to play on special teams. And there was also a
trial at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams has more quickness but Austin has more size,''
Parcells said. ``Williams doesn't have a year's experience in the
league, so every time we put on a new opponent's film, he doesn't
have any idea what's going on. It's all new to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Austin, he was among the second-year players Parcells
admonished to step up to the next level on the first day of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henderson will play some at free safety _ you know what you're
getting from him,'' Parcells said. ``Sometimes that's a little more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe about a team that went 9-7, but eight
months later, with only a week to go before the Jets open their
season against the 49ers, there are different starters at 12
positions, including the punter and the place-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   This week's shifting could also include Lamont Burns at left
guard instead of Todd Burger, an off-season free-agent pickup from
the Bears. Burger admits he has not always pleased the coach, and
said he has been sent messages, such as not starting.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has confused many people in practice this week by
shifting Burger to right guard, and by moving the backup right
guard, Burns, to the left side.
</P>
<P>
   But Burger was a right guard in Chicago for more than a season,
and could be a valuable back-up to starter Matt O'Dwyer if Burns
can beat Burger on the left side. Parcells has been hoping for two
seasons that Burns could land that spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an inconsistent camp,'' said Burns, who was a
fifth-round draft pick last year.
</P>
<P>
   The kicking game also continues to vex Parcells. He will give
Brett Conway, who was recently acquired from the Green Bay Packers,
all the kicks this week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Parcells can decide between Conway and Hall next week,
before going to San Francisco. Parcells dreads having two
place-kickers start a game. In this scenario, Hall would be
employed for kickoffs (29 went for touchbacks a year ago), as well
as field-goal attempts from 50 or more yards.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams makes it, it will be a remarkable coup for the
scouting staff, directed by Dick Haley, as well as for the coaching
staff, because the Jets would have two rookies starting, neither a
high draft pick. Jason Fabini, a fourth-round pick out of
Cincinnati, starts at right tackle. Frost, meanwhile, could be a
year away from making any sort of impact in his new role of safety.
</P>
<P>
   And next week, when the season starts? Who knows. That is why
Parcells plans to employ most of his healthy starters for most of
the Bears' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes playing the fourth preseason game, but you've got
to play it,'' said center Kevin Mawae. ``It looks like I'll be
playing in it a while. By playing a lot you get in a game mood _
because the next week you go right out there and it's the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He just doesn't know who will be on his left side.

EDITORIAL: THE WORLDWIDE STOCK PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., 28 Aug.:
</P>
<P>
   Panics are never pretty, and the one now going on in financial
markets around the world is no exception. In virtually every stock
market, prices fell sharply Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, plunges in world markets have often been halted
in the United States, where individual investors have stepped in to
buy because they were confident that stock prices would rebound. It
appears they have been less eager to do so this summer, although
there is no indication that there has been a lot of selling by such
investors.
</P>
<P>
   While the immediate cause of the panic is the default and
financial chaos in Russia, it also comes at a time of growing
economic weakness around the world. Recessions in Asia appear to be
getting worse, and while the U.S. economy has continued to grow,
the government reported Thursday that after-tax corporate profits
were down in the second quarter from the same period a year ago.
That is the first such decline since 1989, just before the
country's last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year there has been a gradual increase in concern
among investors, which has shown itself in a flight to quality. The
most established economies, in the United States and Western
Europe, have until recently seen the prices of their biggest stocks
rise, while shares of smaller companies did less well and other
stock markets suffered. Now that flight to quality has turned into
a stampede, and all stock markets look suspect to investors, while
only the safest bonds seem attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever investors do in coming days, the important question is
what will happen to the world's economies. Preventing a worldwide
downturn will require a revitalized International Monetary Fund,
and may require the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest
rates in this country, despite its worries about inflation. With
commodity prices at a 21-year low, inflation is not the major
concern now.

COMMENTARY: BIG STATE, BIG DREAMS, BIG TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I love New York as much as the next guy. But still I
don't quite get it.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George Pataki penning his memoirs and fund-raising
around the country and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wowing Iowans, what
was for months a matter of speculation _ and in some circles
incredulity _ now seems all but irrefutable. New York has not one
but two Republican leaders with dreams of the White House dancing
in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   As the goal of their itineraries has in recent weeks become more
explicit, so, too, has their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach works for this city, this state,'' Pataki said
recently, addressing a group of national Republican leaders
gathered in Manhattan, ``and will work for the people of America as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Gross, the mayor's longtime campaign treasurer,
has described Giuliani's travels as an opportunity to spread the
Good News across the land. ``The purpose of the trips is to tell
people the story of the successes in New York City and to help
influence the Republican Party to accept his views on economic and
social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That both Pataki and Giuliani are so busy taking credit for the
same list of accomplishments _ reviving the economy, lowering
taxes, cutting crime and reducing the welfare rolls _ is, of
course, a little awkward. One can only imagine how an audience in
Des Moines, Iowa, or Concord, N.H., will sort out their competing
claims. But in some ways, that's the least of it.
</P>
<P>
   If voters in most parts of the country were presented with some
of New York's vital statistics, they would probably have a hard
time figuring out what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following figures. According to the most recent
federal surveys, New York now ranks 39th among states in job
growth. It is 25th in personal income growth. By contrast, its
outstanding publicly financed debt _ $35 billion and rising fast _
is far and away the largest of any state's and translates, on a per
capita basis, into the country's fourth highest debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of taxes, New York's record is even less boastworthy.
Though the rates have dropped recently, New Yorkers are, experts
say, still paying a higher proportion of their income in combined
state and local taxes than anyone else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the New York economy has improved, that improvement
hardly seems much to crow about. As Hal Hovey, the editor of State
Budget and Tax News, put it: ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to be associated with a national economic recovery. By all these
measures, New York is doing worse than other states.'' All in all,
Hovey, who has spent a lifetime compiling such comparative
statistics, ranks New York 35th in a cumulative measurement he
calls ``economic momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's drop in crime stands up a lot better in
state-by-state comparisons. Still, it, too, reflects a national
trend that appears to be part demographics, part tougher policing
and part mystery.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of New York's other intractable problems
continue to seem just that. The succession of New York City schools
chancellors has, for example, in no way altered the fundamental
fact that few who can afford not to _ including the mayor himself _
send their children to public schools in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi estimated
that it would cost the city $90 billion over the next decade to
repair its neglected infrastructure, a figure almost twice what it
is actually planning to spend. And even as the welfare rolls in New
York have been substantially reduced, the income gap in the state
remains one of the highest in the nation, a disparity that is
obvious to anyone who has walked 20 blocks in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   So what motivates all the grand talk about what New York has to
offer the rest of the nation?
</P>
<P>
   The most generous account would be that Giuliani and Pataki have
simply been carried away by their own enthusiasm. Many good things
HAVE occurred in New York during their tenure, and in
overestimating the global significance of their accomplishments,
they are _ well, typical New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Less charitably, there is room to wonder whether the
exaggeration is calculated, a deliberate misrepresentation of the
state of the state driven by personal ambition. Such things, after
all, do happen.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``Massachusetts Miracle,'' anyone?

SHUT OUT BY CUC, A SECURITIES ANALYST IS VINDICATED 
</HEADLINE>

clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Renck Jr., a Wall Street securities analyst, is a rumpled
man with a sad-eyed smile, the sort Hollywood might cast as a
middle-aged New York City detective. Always outspoken, Renck, who
rose to be an all-star analyst on Institutional Investor's roster,
prides himself on asking tough questions of the companies he
scrutinizes on behalf of potential investors. And he expects
answers. ``If you're going to take the public's money,'' he says,
``you've got to take the public's questions.''
</P>
<P>
   So Renck was shocked at what happened after he prepared a report
seven years ago on CUC International, which operated discount
shopping services for members only. Skeptical about the company's
profitability and surprised at gaps in its reports to shareholders,
Renck advised investors to sell CUC's shares.
</P>
<P>
   CUC's top executives retaliated. They blackballed Renck, he
says, refusing to return his calls or answer his questions. They
took him off their mailing list and left him off the guest list for
meetings at which they explained their company to analysts. Renck
gave up and left CUC to the many other optimistic analysts whose
phone calls were still welcomed _ and whose enthusiastic reports,
in many cases, were submitted to CUC before publication, as Renck
had refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to this April 15, when Wall Street was stunned to
learn that extensive ``accounting irregularities'' had been
uncovered at CUC, which by then had merged with HFS Inc. to form
Cendant Corp. The irregularities, part of what Cendant now says was
a ``systematic fraud'' that had been in place for years, are under
investigation by the company, federal prosecutors and the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As the news broke, Cendant's
stock fell 46 percent, wiping out $14 billion of stockholders'
value.
</P>
<P>
   Renck emphasized that nothing he cited in 1991 suggested any
fraudulent behavior at CUC. But for him and others who do Wall
Street research, this case of blackballing, while unusual, is by no
means unique, and it sends a clear warning. When independent
research analysts, who at their best can be the bloodhounds of the
American stock market, are muzzled, an important check on public
companies is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had dissenting analysts been able to ask questions at company
meetings and on conference calls, the issues would have gotten
out,'' Renck says of CUC. ``Investors would have started asking
about them. The company would have had to deal with it. But when
they can selectively ignore a critic, they can keep the issues off
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Other research professionals share Renck's fear that the threat
of being blackballed, and the self-censorship that can breed, is
leaving small investors more vulnerable to aggressive accounting, a
lack of candor and, in the worst cases, to serious corporate
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caccese, general counsel of the Association for
Investment Management and Research, the umbrella group for 34,000
financial analysts, explained the problem this way: Most ``sell
side'' analysts _ so called because they work for the big brokerage
houses that sell stocks to the public _ are reluctant to write
negative reports or complain about blackballing. Both, he said,
could damage their firm's relationship with the company's chief
executive, who may soon be looking to hire a firm to help undertake
a lucrative deal or sell a new issue of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The National Investor Relations Institute, which represents the
corporate executives who deal with Wall Street analysts and
investors, opposes the practice of blackballing analysts, said
Louis Thompson Jr., its president. ``But my sense is that while it
is not a prevalent practice, it has happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if blackballing is rare in practice, Caccese and Thompson
agreed, it is a potent theoretical threat, one that can deter
aggressive analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Forbes, who was chairman and chief executive of CUC from
1982 until the Cendant merger last December, refused to comment on
any of the issues raised by Renck. Forbes resigned from the Cendant
board last month but has denied any knowledge of the accounting
misdeeds that someone carried out on his watch. The company's board
received its audit committee's report on the wrongdoing at a
meeting Thursday and released it to the public late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the investor relations group showed that
executives at more than 80 percent of leading American companies
were shown advance copies of sell-side analysts' research reports,
a practice that some say is merely an accuracy check but that Renck
and some other analysts see as an invitation to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also cited recent studies that show that negative
reports make up barely 1 percent of the analysts' reports at major
Wall Street firms. ``Over time,'' Thompson said, ``the quality and
credibility of sell-side research has been called into serious
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Big professional investors are already responding by hiring
their own professionals _ called ``buy side'' analysts in Wall
Street jargon _ to evaluate potential investments. As a result, the
consequences of timid sell-side research falls disproportionately
on smaller investors who cannot draw on more independent sources of
information and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Renck says he remembers when Wall Street's sell-side
research still had some teeth. After receiving his bachelor's
degree from St. John's University, he joined the securities firm
Bache &AMP; Co. in 1968, when it was still independent and had a
reputation for speaking its mind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, after earning a master's degree at St. John's and
working at Laird Inc., Renck moved to C.J. Lawrence &AMP; Co., where he
was selected as a second-string member of Institutional Investor's
all-star team in 1976. In 1979, he joined Oppenheimer &AMP; Co., and in
1982 he left to form his own brokerage and research firm, R.L.
Renck &AMP; Co., which specializes in using an analysis of cash flow _
the cash a company's operations generate _ to find stock market
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He had a credible stable of clients by early 1991, and one of
them was curious about CUC International, which had already been
embroiled in accounting controversy. It claimed all the revenue
from the sale of a one-year membership in the first year while
writing off the costs of selling that membership over three years _
an approach that sharply raised the profits the company could take
on each membership sold. In 1989, bowing to Wall Street pressure,
the company adopted a more conservative approach. But when Renck
looked at the company's ledgers in early 1991, he still found
practices that surprised him. For example, although the company
asserted that 70 percent of its new members renewed at the end of
their first year, it provided little detail about the number of
shopping-club members who came and went during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Renewal patterns were important because the company made almost
no money on one-year memberships. Only second-year fees generated
any profit, and therefore the timing and frequency with which
first-year members renewed was critical information. And while
members who canceled were entitled to a full refund, the company's
fund to cover such cancellations seemed strangely protean,
expanding and shrinking without much logic or explanation. He
doubted the company could produce the healthy flow of cash his
clients expected.
</P>
<P>
   His report's conclusion, therefore, was negative. CUC's
management, which had been cooperative before the report appeared,
slammed the door on him. Other analysts said the company told them
that they considered him to be in league with short-sellers,
professional investors who hoped to profit from a decline in CUC's
shares by selling borrowed shares and replacing them with cheaper
ones later.
</P>
<P>
   Renck complained about his treatment in a letter to Forbes,
CUC's chairman, in the fall of 1991. But he received no response,
he said. And so, in early October, he wrote the SEC about his
concerns and questions. He never heard back. But soon thereafter,
CUC amended its previously issued reports to its shareholders for
1991 and early 1992, a fairly unusual occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   One new detail tucked deep into the fine print was an
explanation of how the company calculated its renewal rate _ an
approach that Renck said differed from the one that other analysts
say they heard from company executives. The newly amended report to
shareholders suggested that 70 percent of the members still around
at the end of the first year renewed; the Wall Street version
suggested that 70 percent of all the members who signed on in the
course of a year renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, Renck applied to the commission under the Freedom of
Information Act and obtained the correspondence between CUC and the
regulators. There he found the agency's repeated demands for
information about the comings and goings of members during the
year. The company's lawyers, surprisingly, told the commission that
CUC did not collect that data and could not present it in the way
the agency requested.
</P>
<P>
   Renck had seen enough to convince him that CUC was ``cutting
corners on disclosure and accounting as early as 1991.'' He added,
``They were telling one thing to the SEC about renewal rates and
another thing to analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Renck is the first to say he had not suspected
fraud would later emerge at CUC. He had only spotted what he
thought were red flags pointing to aggressive accounting and
inadequate candor at the company. Forbes refused to comment on
those criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, the chairman and chief executive of Cendant,
said that he was not sure that the red flags and uneasy feelings
that Renck identified in 1991 would have ``changed our investment
premise,'' even if he had known about them before he merged HFS
with Forbes' CUC late last year.
</P>
<P>
   But he has learned that ``many Wall Street analysts were
confused'' about the renewal rates and have told him that ``prior
management may have given the impression that 70 percent of all the
members who signed up renewed.'' His merger team had correctly
understood the renewal rate, he added, but the undiscovered
accounting irregularities profoundly misled them about the
profitability for each member.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said that no skeptical analyst should worry about
being blackballed at Cendant these days _ indeed, Silverman faces
nothing but skeptical analysts in the aftermath of the scandal.
While still among the skeptics, Renck says he thinks the stock is a
bargain at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   What investors need is more aggressive skepticism in advance of
a savings-devouring scandal, research professionals said. ``If
we're lucky, the Cendant situation will prompt a re-examination''
of the issues raised by Renck's experience, Caccese said. ``It
poses a tremendous responsibility on the Street to make sure that
analysts have the ability to get the information they need and to
report it without undue pressure.''

EDITORIAL: ILLUSORY INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Scott Ritter, a top U.S. inspector on the
U.N. team charged with penetrating Iraq's deadly weapons program,
is the latest and most dramatic warning that the Clinton
administration and the United Nations are abandoning a firm
approach toward President Saddam Hussein. Richard Butler, chairman
of the U.N. inspection team, and Mohammed el-Baradei, head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, have previously warned that the
inspectors could no longer guarantee they had Iraq's weapons
programs adequately policed. Now Ritter charges that the
inspections designed to ferret out hidden weapons have become an
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has blocked aggressive inspections while it
tries to build a consensus for firm action in the U.N. Security
Council. But prolonged delay is dangerous, giving Iraq precious
time to build biological or chemical weapons without being
detected. Aggressive inspections must be resumed promptly, and if
additional military forces are needed in the gulf region to lend
credible support to the inspectors, they need to be provided.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to last year, Washington fought off other nations'
efforts to weaken the inspections. On several occasions when Iraq
balked, America's threats brought it into line again. Now Ritter
charges that U.S. officials sought to stop him and others from
carrying out sensitive missions and that Saddam has found a
``witting partner'' in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that a drop in political support for
military intervention, both at home and abroad, has forced it to
explore diplomatic options and seek support on the Security Council
before considering the use of military threats and force.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has argued that
Saddam is still losing the struggle because the economic sanctions
on Iraq will remain.
</P>
<P>
   But sanctions are not an end in themselves, merely a means to
compel Saddam to cooperate. His willingness to live with sanctions
is a measure of the importance he places on acquiring weapons of
mass destruction. Sanctions and diplomacy cannot work unless backed
by the threat of force _ if necessary, by the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   The administration must not let its diplomacy drift into
dangerous delay. Even a few more weeks free of inspections might
allow Saddam to revive construction of a biological, chemical or
nuclear weapon. As Washington contemplates an extended war against
terrorism, it cannot give in to a man who specializes in the
unthinkable.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A pipe bomb exploded in a trash can on a busy Tel
Aviv street Thursday, causing one serious injury and adding to a
new wave of tension in Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions, in turn, have followed new signs that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may finally be prepared to strike a
deal with the Palestinians that would enable peace negotiations to
resume. The negotiations have been effectively frozen since March
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police described the bombing as a ``terrorist attack,'' a term
usually denoting Arabs. There were no immediate arrests, and no
Palestinian organization claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion happened at about 8:50 a.m. on Allenby Street in
central Tel Aviv. Police said the crude device consisted of about
3.5 ounces of explosive in a pipe packed with nails.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic bin absorbed much of the blast, though many
surrounding shop windows were shattered. One woman was reported in
serious condition, and about 20 other people were treated for cuts,
burns or shock.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was the first in Tel Aviv since March 1997 and the
first in Israel in almost a year, and it came at a time of
heightened tensions on the northern border and in Hebron in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, a barrage of Katyusha rockets fired by guerrillas
of the militant Islamic Hezbollah movement from southern Lebanon on
Tuesday struck the Israeli town of Qiryat Shemona and parts of
western Galilee. The rockets caused only minor injuries and damage,
but they raised the threat that Israel would retaliate and trigger
a new round of violence in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The Katyusha attack followed an Israeli strike that killed a
leader of another Islamic militia, Amal. The chief, Husam Amin, was
struck by a laser-guided missile fired from an Apache helicopter
gunship as he drove in his car near Tyre on the Lebanese coast.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether the Hezbollah strike was in
retaliation for the killing of Amin, or for an earlier shelling of
Hezbollah strongholds by Israel's Christian allies in southern
Lebanon, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has insisted for several years that it fires rockets
into northern Israel only when Israel or the the South Lebanon Army
launch attacks outside Israel's self-proclaimed buffer zone in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, more than 1,000 militant Jewish settlers gathered
Thursday in the tiny, hill-side settlement known as Tel Rumeida to
mark the end of the seven-day mourning period for a 63-year-old
rabbi who was stabbed to death in his home by an assailant who
climbed through a window.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Rabbi Shlomo Raanan, a grandson of a venerated
chief rabbi in Palestine before the establishment of the state of
Israel, raised the level of hatred in the old center of Hebron,
where about 450 militant Jews live under heavy army protection,
even higher that usual. Though only seven Jewish families live in
the cluster of prefabricated houses in Tel Rumeida, they are
regarded as among the most radical of the Hebron settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 Palestinians who live in the section of Hebron still
under Israeli military control have been under a curfew since the
shooting, which has been lifted for only a few hours daily to
enable the Arabs to shop. But settlers have repeatedly tried to
beat Palestinians, or to damage their windows, market stalls or
cars.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Israeli troops were mobilized for the memorial
service Thursday, and the only incidents were a few scuffles as
settlers tried to beat and eject Palestinian photographers and
television cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service, militants voiced standard demands that
the government cease ceding land to ``terrorists'' and that the
army take stern action against them.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the stabbing last week, Netanyahu pledged
his government would build permanent housing for 50 families in Tel
Rumeida. The promise was apparently intended to placate the
settlers. Both President Ezer Weizman and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, whose moderate politics have made them special targets
of settler antipathy, were fiercely denounced at Thursday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   When Weizman paid a condolence call on Rabbi Raanan's family
last Sunday, he was assailed by a well-known radical, Baruch
Marzel, who shouted, ``You are a spy and a danger to the public and
should be put in an institution.'' Marzel was summoned by police
under Israeli laws against abusing public officials, and he said he
was questioned and released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have risen just as new signs were surfacing that
Netanyahu might be approaching a decision on withdrawing Israeli
forces from 13 percent of the West Bank _ which would enable
negotiations with the Palestinians to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in Oslo, Norway, Yasser Arafat, head of the
Palestinian Authority, declared that he could accept Israel's plan
to include existing nature reserves as part of the 13 percent
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But in subsequent statements, the Israeli leader appeared to
retreat on another issue, that of convening the full Palestinian
National Council _ the ``parliament'' of the Palestine Liberation
Organization _ to redraft the Palestinian covenant and excise all
calls for Israel's destruction. Netanyahu had been reported ready
to settle for the task to be done by some body other than the
council, which includes many Palestinian radicals in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting victims of Thursday's explosion in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu
declared, ``I want to declare in the clearest possible way that
there will not be a deal if the Palestinian Authority does not
fight _ in deeds and words _ murderers and terror.''

SEARCH FINDS NO TRACE OF MISSING WIDOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators probing the disappearance of a wealthy
82-year-old Manhattan woman searched a remote area of high weeds
and dense scrub in northern New Jersey on Thursday, but found no
trace of the woman, Irene Silverman, who vanished nearly eight
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have called her disappearance an apparently deadly con
game to acquire her town house.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on information provided by a Florida man who worked for
the mother and son who are the prime suspects in the case, police
officers with machetes and shovels spent the day and early evening
scouring a large tract just north of St. Peter's Cemetery and just
west of Highway 1-9, in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   As commuter and freight trains rumbled through the isolated
area, dozens of New York and Jersey City officers moved through
shoulder-high weeds, hacking at scrub and overturning earth.
Shortly before 8 p.m., after 10 hours, the search was suspended
until Friday morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 5, when Mrs. Silverman, a widow, disappeared from her
mansion at 20 E. 65th St., authorities have searched unsuccessfully
in parks and dumps, around airports, along highways and in the
Meadowlands of New Jersey, where the suspects were reported to have
spent part of that day.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects _ Sante Kimes, 63, and her son, Kenneth, 23, who
rented a room in Mrs. Silverman's mansion _ were arrested in
Manhattan on the evening of her disappearance on an unrelated Utah
warrant on a bad-check charge. At the time, they held a deed
transferring her home to them for $390,000, about 10 percent of its
value, as well as her identity cards and other financial papers.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators have found no forensic evidence linking the
Kimeses to Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, they have said they
believe she was killed as part of a scheme to swindle her out of
her town house. But the Kimeses have not been charged in her
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have been held without bail on charges of passing
a bad check to bilk a Utah dealer out of a Lincoln Town Car and of
obtaining a credit card in the name of a Florida man and using it
for dining and shopping in New York. They are also suspects in the
slaying of a California man and the disappearance of a bank
examiner in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses, described by authorities as grifters and drifters,
have refused to speak to investigators, but their lawyers have
repeatedly denied the allegations against them and insisted that
there is no basis for suspecting them in Mrs. Silverman's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investigators found a possible witness in the case.
Police said the witness, Jose Antonio Alvarez, 24, of Belle Grande,
Fla., might have been with the Kimeses last spring when they used
bad checks to buy an $80,000 motor home. He also accompanied them
to New York in June, and was seen at Mrs. Silverman's mansion in
the days before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, regarded as a witness and not a suspect, was taken to
New York on Wednesday and has been aiding detectives in the case;
his information, they said, led to Thursday's search.

EX-MIAMI COMMISSIONER PLEADS GUILTY IN CONSPIRACY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A former Miami city commissioner, Humberto Hernandez,
pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit
bank, wire and mail fraud, less than two weeks after a Florida
judge sentenced him to a year in prison for a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had faced a 28-count indictment involving fraudulent
real estate transactions and the use of a Medicare fraud scheme to
increase his real estate holdings. Federal prosecutors said they
had agreed to drop all of the charges except one, and that they
would recommend that Hernandez serve four years in prison for the
conspiracy charge, which usually carries a maximum penalty of five
years. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humberto Hernandez, after much deliberation, concluded that it
was in his best interests and the best interests of his family to
put this matter to an end,'' Jose Quinon, a lawyer for Hernandez,
said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has been in federal custody since late May, when state
prosecutors charged him in an investigation of vote fraud in last
November's citywide elections. On Aug. 14, a jury acquitted him on
charges of obstructing justice and fabricating evidence, but
convicted him on a lesser count of being an accessory to covering
up evidence of fraud. Three days after he was convicted, Hernandez
was officially removed from the Miami City Commission by Gov.
Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. attorney's office said they would agree to
allow Hernandez to serve his federal and state sentences
concurrently. He was indicted along with seven other people, but
does not intend to serve as a witness for prosecutors, Quinon said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's guilty plea contrasted sharply with months of
defiance in which he denied any wrongdoing, and he said on
Spanish-language radio programs that he was a target because of his
Hispanic origins.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has acquired a dubious reputation in recent years as a
city where official corruption is the norm. Hernandez's case was
one of the most prominent in a series that in the last year has led
to charges against top city officials and politicians, including a
former city manager, a state senator and a director of the port
authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state attorney's office for Miami-Dade County said recently
that in the last five years it had charged at least 270 public
employees with crimes that included falsification of records and
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   A state investigation into last November's voter fraud ended in
several arrests this year. In March, a civil suit filed by Miami's
current mayor, Joe Carollo, led to the removal of Xavier Suarez as
mayor only four weeks after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in that case determined that Suarez's election was
invalidated by hundreds of absentee votes fraudulently cast in his
favor. Most of those votes were from Hernandez's Little Havana
district.
