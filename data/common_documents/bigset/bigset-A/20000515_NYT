SOFT-SPOKEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SEEKS TO REASSURE L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reforms of the Los Angeles Police Department can
be worked out without undermining local control, the country's
civil rights chief, Bill Lann Lee, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out for the first time since the U.S. Justice
Department's ultimatum to city officials a week ago to fix the LAPD
or face a civil rights lawsuit, Lee said he wants to make the LAPD
a better organization through managerial changes that will assure
the constitutional rights of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Justice) Department has no desire to take over or to
hamstring the operations of the local police,'' Lee said in a
telephone interview with the Daily News. ``The officers in the
field will not be hampered.We just want to make sure the LAPD is
doing the best job it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work hard to support the local police; the people of
Los Angeles will see that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lee declined to discuss the specifics of the four-year federal
civil rights investigation, punctuated by the Rampart corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as city leaders were huddling for what
promises to be a series of high-stakes negotiations this week.
Sources say city officials want the Justice Department to be more
forthcoming on the strength of its case.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the city, acting on limited information, would either
have to agree to settle the case through a consent decree retaining
some local control through a jointly selected mediator or risk
losing in court and suffering even harsher penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, according to many who have known him during a long and
prestigious career as a civil rights attorney in Los Angeles, is
committed to consensus building. He was a central figure in a
comprehensive federal consent decree with the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority in 1996 that controls funding for a large
portion of the city's troubled public transportation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a belief in trying to work out difficult controversies;
that's the main thing I think I bring to the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around City Hall, several officials were flattered by visits
from the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights prior
to May 8's meeting, where he announced the civil rights ``pattern
and practice'' lawsuit had been authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick said Lee introduced himself several
weeks ago, stressing his local ties and his desire to do the best
for a city he has affection for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much wanted me to remember he's a person of Los
Angeles, that he knows and cares about Los Angeles,'' Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that struck me the most was how much he didn't want
to play the role of the occupying army. He wanted the local
authority leading the way. He was not heavy handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 51, hardly looks or acts the part of a tough negotiator and
litigator. At last week's meeting, 14 of the city's most powerful
leaders had to lean forward to decipher his softly spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I happen to believe that often the best resolution on
civil rights matters is when the parties can work it out
themselves,'' Lee said, his voice barely audible on the phone. ``I
think there's an opportunity to bring a lot of people together here
for a potential settlement. There's a chance to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to approach this in the spirit of cooperation,''
he added. ``All points of view will be heard. People will be rising
to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Both his former colleagues and adversaries see Lee as something
of an invisible man with a unique ability to hammer out agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Klein, head of litigation for the law firm Riordan &AMP;
McKinzie, squared off in the early 1990s when Lee was leading the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's crusade to force the MTA
to improve bus service.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, the MTA's longtime outside counsel, was tasked by the
agency with staving off a costly and potentially embarrassing
lawsuit a similar situation to the one the LAPD now faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first meeting in their offices but I don't
remember if Lee was there or not,'' Klein recalled. ``That's very
revealing because that's the kind of guy he is. I wouldn't be
surprised if he was there and I didn't realize it, and didn't
realize he was co-equal or above everyone else there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lee were still involved, Klein said the MTA consent decree
likely would have succeeded without the current ``legal fireworks''
that have pitted the MTA against bus advocates in lengthy
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Bill's a savior,'' Klein said. ``It's just that
once he left there was no one still there like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he hasn't kept up with the MTA consent decree since
leaving Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City, Lee comes
from a humble background. His parents owned a small laundry and he
credits his father, who suffered anti-Chinese taunts despite his
proud military service, with providing the inspiration for a career
in civil rights law.
</P>
<P>
   (more)
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he's still stirred by the memory of the American flag
given to his mother at his father's funeral nine year's ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched my father sometimes being demeaned or taunted,
because he was a lowly laundryman and didn't speak English well,''
Lee said. ``But he had this abiding belief of American promise,
which he'd learned in the American Army.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Bronx High School of Science, Lee
benefited from an affirmative action program at Yale University,
winning a scholarship designed to recruit minority students. He
graduated with honors in 1971 and went on to Columbia University
Law School, where he graduated in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Before President Bill Clinton appointed Lee as acting assistant
attorney general for civil rights in December 1997, Lee was the
Western Regional Counsel for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund;
before that he worked at the Center for Law in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who worked with Lee at the
NAACP, said he has a genius for inspiring trust in his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't mind if his opponents take the credit,'' if a
satisfactory deal is struck, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate has refused on two separate
occasions to confirm Lee's nomination by Clinton. The Senate
majority has decried Lee as a liberal with an affirmative action
agenda, citing his opposition to a California initiative ending
affirmative actions programs as proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, chose not to reject Lee outright by
recording its vote. That allowed Clinton to appoint Lee ``acting''
chief of the federal Civil Rights Division, a move that would allow
him to serve until Clinton leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee has made an immediate good impression with city
leaders, his personal reassurances still leave many unanswered
questions among city officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments on the Justice Department's findings and
demands, Riordan has argued that the city, not a federally
appointed monitor, should control the police force's day-to-day
operations and implement the required reforms. The mayor also has
been unflinching in his support of LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the terms of the consent decree are scheduled
to begin this week. The city's negotiating team is Riordan's Chief
of Staff Kelly Martin, City Attorney James Hahn, Police Commission
President Gerald Chaleff and Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has known Lee for years, said
the civil rights chief has made every attempt to stress that the
federal government is here to help the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lee) wants L.A. to do what it needs to do, and what it hasn't
done, which is to get to the bottom of the problems in the
department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong supporter of the LAPD,'' Lee said. ``We just want
to make sure all the laws are lived up to and that the LAPD is
doing the best it can for all citizens.''

LAKERS QUIET ON BIZARRE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ First, the Los Angeles Lakers lost control of the
game. Then they lost their grip.
</P>
<P>
   The closing minutes of Sunday's 117-98 defeat to the Phoenix
Suns turned into just a series of pratfalls and high jinks. You
half expected Dennis Rodman to suit up and join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Rick Fox, who played a mere two minutes in the
second half and perhaps needed to unleash some frustration. With
3:58 left, the Lakers down 19 points, Fox for some reason
intentionally fouled Clifford Robinson, then briefly scuffled with
him, drawing a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one seconds later, Fox did the same thing, grabbing
Robinson from behind as soon as he caught the ball. Robinson
laughed, while Fox exchanged words with official Joey Crawford, who
gave Fox a second technical and an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fox was in no mood to offer insight, walking past a
reporter without speaking, while teammate John Salley ran
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not talking,'' Salley said. ``You don't want to get
cursed out. He's not talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry waved off any questions about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Rick about that one. I can't answer for him,'' he said.
``I don't know what was going on with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson made the next oddball move, calling a timeout
with 18.4 seconds left, the Lakers down 21 points. Before play
could resume, Suns coach Scott Skiles retaliated with a pointless
timeout of his own. Then Jackson called one more, with 14.7 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't offer any explanations afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just having fun; we were just having fun,'' Ron Harper
said. ``Part of the game. He called timeout, we called timeout.
Hey, all in fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Home cookin': The upside for the Lakers is that, assuming they
put away the Suns on Tuesday, they'll have only four or five days
to wait for the conference finals to start. In the meantime,
they'll take solace in playing at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 5-0 in the postseason at Staples Center, after
going 36-5 there this season. This, they said, is what the
homecourt advantage in the playoffs is for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played 82 games, and we earned it, to be able to head back
home,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' victory Sunday was their first in eight meetings with
the Lakers this season, and they are 0-4 at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 3-1, they're going home, where they've dominated,''
Skiles said. ``We have in the last month of the season become a
good road team. ... We're certainly not intimidated to go back
there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Blasted: The Lakers made defense their calling card this season,
then misplaced the entire deck Sunday, when the Suns scored 71
points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange,'' Glen Rice said. ``That's one of those
nightmares, and we're a very capable team, and something like that
should never happen. And we just gotta hope it never does again.''
</P>
<P>
   Being Willis Reed: A sprained right ankle supposedly threatened
to keep the Suns' Clifford Robinson off the court, but it was hard
to tell as he cruised to a career-playoff-high 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is great. God works miracles, and evidently Cliff wasn't
feeling any pain out there,'' teammate Penny Hardaway said.

THOUSANDS MARCH IN WASHINGTON FOR GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Delivering an emphatic message along with a blunt
election-year threat, hundreds of thousands of mothers and other
gun-control advocates rallied Sunday in the name of protecting
children and to prod Congress to pass stricter gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the future. You are the ones who are going to make our
lawmakers listen,'' Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control,
Inc., told participants in the Million Mom March on the National
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must either change the minds of these lawmakers, or for
God's sake, in November, let's change the lawmakers,'' said Brady.
Her husband, James, was Ronald Reagan's press secretary when he was
shot and seriously wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on
the president's life.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers and participants saw Sunday's event as an important
step toward achieving their policy goals, which include licensing
all gun owners, requiring trigger locks for handguns, and mandatory
safety training. They also want to change public attitudes about
the way guns are sold and regulated.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Sunday, they were claiming success for the
march.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event estimated more than 500,000 people took
part. There was no crowd estimate from the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people from Washington attended, state organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone way beyond my expectations,'' said Melissa
Chasan, 40, of Mercer Island, who helped organize Washington
state's effort. ``This has been amazing,'' she said, gazing over
the immense crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Similar rallies were scheduled in nearly 70 cities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In Olympia, Wash., hundreds of women staged opposing Mother's
Day rallies Sunday, one group calling for an end to gun violence
and one demanding that the right to keep and bear arms be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control advocates didn't have the day to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand counter-demonstrators, organized by a group
called Second Amendment Sisters, Inc., gathered near the Washington
Monument to argue that guns were needed for self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and many Democrats have seized on gun control
as a seminal issue in the fall election and they used the march as
a way to expose their differences with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be deterred by the intimidation, don't be deterred by
the screaming, don't be deterred by the political mountain you have
to climb. You just remember this: There are more people who think
like you in America,'' Clinton told the crowd in comments broadcast
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined the march.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, like many Democrats and the organizers of Sunday's
march at the Mall, backs legislation that would close a loophole
allowing guns to be sold at gun shows without a full background
check. He supports rules that would require child safety locks to
be provided with every handgun sold; ban high-capacity ammunition
clips; bar the most violent juveniles from possessing firearms as
adults; and hold adults accountable if they allow children access
to guns.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has countered with a pledge to
spend an additional $1 million of its money on gun safety education
in elementary schools, a proposal that organizers of the Million
Mom March derided.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the march say such efforts divert attention from
core questions and allow opponents to claim that the goal is to
keep guns away from law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case, supporters of the march said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of people we need to keep from guns from _
criminals and children,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who was
one of the few members of Congress to attend the march here.
</P>
<P>
   And despite failures by gun-control advocates to move tougher
legislation through Congress, Inslee said the tide might be
turning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the start of a larger movement that will
result in common-sense laws, I really do,'' he said. ``This issue
has been so stuck on ideology for so long, but we're hearing moms
saying don't get stuck on ideology, do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the birth of our baby and we still intend to raise the
child. We are not going away,'' said Josie Powers, 28, who helped
organize a Saturday rally in Seattle and then flew to Washington
for the main event.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March underscored the deep divide caused by gun
control proposals. The counter demonstration only blocks away drew
women advocating gun rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legally carrying people are the safe folks. It's the bad
guys. Why aren't we concentrating on the bad guys and leave decent,
law-abiding people alone to defend themselves and their families?''
Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia Hupp said Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hupp, whose parents were among those killed by a gunman in a
Texas cafeteria in October 1991, was a keynote speaker at the
Second Amendment Sisters rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Registration and licensing is nothing but a controlled burn of
the Second Amendment,'' Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of
the NRA, said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' ``That's not the answer.
You don't want to set aside or set on fire our freedoms. What you
want to do is you want to enforce the laws against the bad guys we
already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by a New Jersey mother last year, the Million Mom
March featured an array of celebrities from talk show host Rosie
O'Donnell to singer Raffi to actress Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   Women from Washington state marched behind an eight-foot banner
that said, ``Congress, stop taking bribes from the NRA,'' a
reference to the political contributions made by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Many in attendance were motivated by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun that killed my daughter in her classroom was one that
could be loaded by a 6-year-old, carried by a 6-year-old, and fired
by a 6-year-old,'' said Veronica McQueen, whose daughter, Kayla
Rolland, was shot and killed by her classmate in her first grade
classroom in Flint, Mich., last Feb. 29.

MIAMI TURNOVERS LET KNICKS EVEN SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Honest-to-goodness basketball returned to this
Eastern Conference semifinal Sunday. So did equality.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, facing an almost unmanageable 3-1 deficit, rallied
behind Charlie Ward (20 points, 9 in the final 4:04) and squared
this best-of-seven affair at 2-2 with a 91-83 victory over
error-prone Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The series has been reduced to a best-of-three, with Game 5
Wednesday night in Miami. The Heat needed at least a split here;
they got that but still left town quite upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a gift,'' said a disgusted Alonzo Mourning, who
accepted the role as chief gift-giver with nine turnovers. He also
missed three big free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost gotta be mistake-free in a series like this,''
Mourning said. ``We gave them gifts, constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat turned it over 17 times, which the Knicks gratefully
turned into 28 points (a 14-point edge in that department). The
Knicks did an about-face from Game 3 and outscored Miami, 17-6, on
second-chance points. Miami still had a rebounding advantage,
48-37, but the Knicks controlled the boards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had times where we struggled,'' said Patrick Ewing (12
points, 11 rebounds, 1 block), ``but we still played with a lot of
energy and emotion. I think that is what got us over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   New York had enviable balance offensively _ yes, it finally
broke 90 _ with Ward leading all five starters in double figures.
Allan Houston had 17 (after a scoreless first quarter) while
Latrell Sprewell cavorted for 16. Mourning led Miami with 27. The
redoubtable Dan Majerle had 13 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 steals in
a losing cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were forced into desperation mode and, as has been
the pattern when these two teams meet in the playoffs, the loser
tends to bounce back. No one has been able to win two straight over
their last nine playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up and down. Up and down. That is the way we always play
against each other,'' said Miami's Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   New York led at every checkpoint and actually had a double-digit
lead (10 points) for the second time in the series. (Miami has yet
to experience that thrill.) A late run in the third quarter gave
the Knicks a 66-57 lead heading into the fourth and Miami never got
closer than 5 over the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they didn't have their chances. Coach Pat
Riley said it was ``mind-blowing'' that, despite the Heat's erratic
play, they were still in position to steal it in the final four
minutes. The Knicks led, 84-78, when Mourning missed three of four
freebies. Instead of a 2-point game, it was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the Knicks' next possession, Houston missed a
3-pointer, but Ewing knocked away the rebound and Ward saved it
from going out of bounds. The point guard, who went 32 minutes,
then converted a runner in the lane to make it 86-79 with 1:51
left. (He was fouled, too, but missed the free throw.) He scored
the final 9 points for the Knicks, eliciting chants of ``Charlie,
Charlie'' from the Madison Square Garden faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that sealed the game,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Riley had not liked what he saw in practice Saturday and hoped
that something would change by game time. But turnovers, missed
assignments, and overall sloppy play prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the game that I was afraid we were going to play,'' he
said. ``They had a lot to do with that. But I don't think our focus
and our concentration (was there), being aware of just how much
they needed this game. We were absolutely careless. We made more
mistakes defensively than we made in the previous three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley had tried to stress that a victory would have all but
knocked out the Knicks. Instead, he and everyone else are looking
at a knock-down, drag-out affair _ again _ that looks every bit
like it will go the full seven. There hasn't been a Heat-Knicks
series that hasn't gone the distance yet. This one doesn't look
like it will be the exception.

   &UR; BILL GOODYKOONTZ  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - We spend so much of our time consumed by television -
what if it consumed us literally?
</P>
<P>
   What if you woke up one day and found yourself living inside
your favorite shows, alongside your favorite (and not-so-favor ite)
characters?
</P>
<P>
   A day in the TV life:
</P>
<P>
   You awake, sweating from an other Regis nightmare in Frasier
Crane's well-appointed apart ment, with Dharma (or Greg, depending)
silently snoozing be side you. You stop on your way from the
bedroom to the kitchen to admire the Seattle skyline. Man, what
swell digs.
</P>
<P>
   But you're in a hurry - you've got to get to your job at the
White House (I know, it's in Washington, D.C., not Washington
state, but this is TV world - normal laws of reality and physics
don't apply). Best job you've ever had, work ing for President
Bartlet along side Leo, Toby, C.J. and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that your last job was anything to sneeze at. Nothing offers
the security of being safety inspector for the Spring field Nuclear
Power Plant, a job from which it is apparently im possible to be
fired, as your successor, Homer someone or other, has proved time
and again. Four fingers - what do you expect?
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the car that Titus customized for you, you notice
smoke coming out of the neigh bor's house, accompanied by the usual
screaming and crashing. That Malcom kid seems OK, but the other
boys drive you crazy. It would almost be funny if you didn't live
right next door.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's secretary is now your own, and the calendar she hands you
is full. Oddly, it's almost all personal stuff. For instance,
you've got to find someone to cut your hair - there is no way
you're going back to the butcher who allowed Felicity to sacrifice
her lucrative locks on the altar of young-star independence. Kids!
</P>
<P>
   You've also got to find a birth day gift for your father-in-law,
Arthur Spooner, who you can't help but notice bears a remark able
resemblance to Frank Cos tanza, only in a less-funny show.
</P>
<P>
   But first and foremost you've got to call your lawyer, Bobby
Donnell. (Yes, he's in Boston, but this is still TV, so it's a
local call with a 555 prefix.) It's good you found him - Ally over
at Cage, Fish &AMP; Associates was never available to take your calls,
al ways busy defending women ac cused of smothering their
89-year-old husbands with their gigantic breasts and such - an
actual plot too ridiculous even for this dream.
</P>
<P>
   No time for lunch - you've decided to buy Arthur a book. But the
only bookstore nearby is that one in Once and Again, and you'd
rather not read again than set foot in that pretentious yup pie
joint. (Plus for half the year, it occupied NYPD Blue's ad dress.)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a stabbing pain in the gut doubles you over. Even
though you've collapsed, you re fuse the Third Watch ambulance
crew's offer of a ride to the hospital, preferring to crawl the
entire distance on your belly rather than spend time with them.
</P>
<P>
   When you reach the emer gency room, Dr. Carter gives you the
news - your appendix is hot; it has to come out immediately. Dr.
Benton is busy, but luckily, Dr. Shutt has agreed to do the
operation, even though he is a neurosurgeon at a different Chi cago
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But he cancels at the last minute, and just before you're put
under, you see Dr. Hanlon - a cosmetic surgeon - heading your way
with a scalpel. Horrified, recalling her work opposite Jim Carrey
in Dumb and Dumber, you bolt, appendicitis or not, figuring that
Chicago Hope will be canceled before you get your bill, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the pain miraculously disappears - it's TV, remember -
freeing you up for dinner at Artie Bucco's place, because you're
convinced that that's not where Tony Soprano got food poisoning. I
mean, if he had, Artie would be dead, right?
</P>
<P>
   You stop back by the office, which is now the basement of the
FBI building, to tell Scully (or Mulder, depending) that you're
going to take Nurse Hathaway (or Dr. Greene, depending) to the
Warsaw for a few beers with Drew (or Kate, depending) and the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Scully scoffs, for the ump teenth time, and says she's think ing
about going to Roswell if you don't soon make up your mind about
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Harrumph. Women. (Or men, depending.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving to the bar, a cop pulls you over for speeding. He identi
fies himself as Detective Sipow icz, and for no reason whatsoever,
he starts screaming at you. Luckily, Detective Briscoe pulls up and
the two begin screaming at each other, so you get away clean.
</P>
<P>
   What a day. You decide you'll just head home, which is now the
cool brick number that Michael Wiseman lives in on Now and Again.
You're so tired it takes only a second for you to fall asleep after
Buffy (or Angel, depending) tucks you in.

RED SOX PROVING MEN OF POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It's early. Do you realize how often you will hear
that today?
</P>
<P>
   People who have pinstripes coursing through their veins and
``NY'' stitched on their baseball caps will tell you how early it
is. You will hear it from worriers, augurs, and cynics. You'll
innocently ask someone the time and they'll turn it into a Red Sox
monologue. ``Don't get too excited,'' they'll begin, ``It's early .
. . ''
</P>
<P>
   You shouldn't listen to these people. I think sports fans are
the only ones who keep the It's Early cliche alive. I can't recall
sitting in a movie theater, raving about the beginning of an
excellent film, and having the person next to me whisper, ``Chill
out, man. It's still early.''
</P>
<P>
   It is May 15th and, after their long weekend at Camden Yards,
the Sox are the first-place team in the American League East. It's
early. And it doesn't make a difference. A month from now, the Sox
will be in first or hovering around it. Two months from now, it
will be the same. They aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They are a bunch of guys interested in reading baseball's fine
print. They love pitching, bunting, hitting cutoff men, and _ this
is what they consider an exotic dessert _ circling like taloned
carnivores when a team makes a mistake. They have a starter (Pedro
Martinez) and reliever (Derek Lowe) so dominant that you can
combine their ERAs and the number you get _ 1.80 _ still will fall
short of 2. They have a dynamic player, Donnie Sadler, who could
audition as the fleet Mercury if there is a play staged about the
gods of Roman mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler helped win Sunday's game by doing basic things such as
flawlessly executing his end of a 7-6-2 putout in the fourth
inning. He also turned what should have been a single into a double
in the fifth, simply by running hard around first. Ask him about it
and he'll shrug. He's been running hard since his childhood in
Valley Mills, Texas. Then, he would build up his speed by
spontaneously racing against his cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would say, ``Let's run to such and such place.' And we'd
run there, just to see who could get there first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, though, will not travel south quickly. The only way
they will go south is if they take a road trip such as the last
one, to the Near South.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 23 years, a Boston team came here and
swept a four-game series from the Orioles. The Sox won Sunday's
game, 10-1. After losing Nomar Garciaparra and Carl Everett to
injuries in Game 1, the Sox outscored the Orioles, 24-2, over the
next three games (it was 35-6 for the series).
</P>
<P>
   The only disclaimer there is that the Orioles are dreadful. For
the entire series, it always seemed that Mike Hargrove was walking
from the dugout to the mound to rescue a sorry pitcher. He should
get used to this errand. If I were a corporate executive looking
for good advertising space, I would try to put my company's logo at
the base of the Camden Yards mound. Really, that's all Orioles fans
see when they're watching on TV: Hargrove walking to the mound with
his hand out, asking one beleaguered pitcher for the ball so he can
give it to another.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox don't have that problem. They will be fine. There is no
bogeyman hiding in an AL closet, waiting to jump out at them. And
even if there were, they wouldn't be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at a team's character,'' Darren Lewis said.
``Are they playing for each other? Do they help one another out? Is
everybody trying to go deep? We're not a Rotisserie team. We just
know how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play (in the fourth) when Troy (O'Leary) played the carom
and made the throw? That was huge. Those parts of the game are
overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other things, too. You should see how the Sox
interact. You should have seen how ecstatic Martinez was to see
Sadler when he was recalled from the minors on Friday. ``Little
man,'' the pitcher called to the 5-foot-6-inch Sadler, ``let me see
you!'' When Sadler's bags were temporarily lost in US Airways
limbo, you should have seen how Sadler moved about the room and was
able to collect spare equipment, mostly from a man, Jeff Frye, who
made the team at Sadler's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the fans don't see that side of the Sox, but they like
to, as manager Jimy Williams would say, watch these kids perform.
As early as Thursday afternoon, it was apparent that the Sox and
their fans would have been comfortable staking ``Welcome To
Massachusetts'' signs in Maryland soil.
</P>
<P>
   There were Sox fans in local bars and restaurants. There were
even fans chanting ``Yankees Suck'' outside an Inner Harbor hotel
at 3 o'clock Saturday morning. Yes, this definitely felt like the
South _ the South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the Sox don't have major flaws. They may
prove me wrong, but I can't see how a team with such a weak right
infield can win a World Series. If I were manager for a day, I'd
make Jose Offerman a full-time DH, and move Sadler to second. It
wouldn't matter if he hit .202. Sadler has such range that he could
make up for some of the defensive deficiencies of Mike Stanley and
Brian Daubach (Don't ask me how I would rotate three DH types in
Offerman, Stanley, and Daubach. Who do you think I am, Jimy?).
</P>
<P>
   As the Sox were packing for Toronto Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Williams was
asked what it's like to be around his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm phrasing this the right way,'' the manager began.
``I don't know all about their backgrounds and what all their
families are like. I don't know who is from the rich part of town
and who is from the poor part. But all of them could be from the
same place. Know what I mean? They've all got an honest enthusiasm
for this game. They love to play. They have something that makes me
think they were raised in a certain way, with a certain ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that's something else that will be unchanged between
now and the next few months.

RED SOX SWEEP ORIOLES, TAKE AL EAST LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For a few moments, Red Sox pitcher Brian Rose
sounded like a clone of his coach, Joe Kerrigan, expounding on his
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Then he caught himself. This wasn't about technical mastery,
what Rose did Sunday in pitching the Red Sox into first place in a
10-1 rout that completed a four-game sweep of the Orioles, the
first by the Sox in Baltimore in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   This was about something more primitive, something that could
not be detected merely by rerunning a videotape. This was about
Rose, looking taller than he ever has, coming off the mound in the
fifth inning, pumping his fists once, twice, three times after
winning a pitched battle against the heart of the Baltimore order,
B.J. Surhoff and Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can throw the mechanics out the door, at a time like
that,'' Rose said. ``It was just me against him. Somebody's got to
give. You can only throw so many pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   This was before the Red Sox, once again playing without Nomar
Garciaparra and Carl Everett, broke open a close game with their
second straight eighth-inning eruption, scoring seven runs as the
Orioles imploded from a toxic mix of wretched defense and clueless
relief pitching.
</P>
<P>
   This was when the Orioles, desperate to end what is now a
seven-game slide, were down just a run, 2-1, after Rose walked Mike
Bordick with one out and the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Rheal Cormier was throwing in the Sox bullpen. Surhoff, the No.
3 batter in the Orioles order, was in a deep slump (1 for 20) but
always a dangerous hitter with the bases loaded, batting .412
lifetime with five grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Four times with a 1-and-2 count, Surhoff fouled off pitches,
including a line drive down the right-field line that landed a foot
foul. Rose missed with a pitch, took a deep breath, then threw
Surhoff a changeup. Surhoff popped it up to shortstop Donnie
Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to make a good pitch, got him swinging off his
front foot, and he popped it up,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Now came Belle, dubbed the A-Bomb by one Baltimore writer both
for his explosive bat and his volatile temperament. Rose challenged
Belle with eight straight fastballs, which normally is as advisable
as a reporter asking him a question.
</P>
<P>
   But with a full count, Belle hit a fly ball to right field,
where Trot Nixon, drifting back, lifted his glove and made the
routine catch.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, no longer waiting to exhale, made his triumphant return to
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've ever seen him throw,'' said center
fielder Darren Lewis. ``He had a lot of velocity and he was hitting
his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be Rose's 91st and last pitch of the afternoon, as a
bullpen that strung together 12 1/3 scoreless innings here polished
off the Orioles, with Cormier and John Wasdin pitching two innings
apiece. But it was clear that Rose had done more than leave the Sox
in position to win their fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendous, I think, to build on something like that,''
manager Jimy Williams said of Rose, who has pitched well in three
of his last four starts, allowing just three earned runs in 17
innings in those three games, all wins. ``Surhoff fouling off all
those pitches, throwing that many pitches, and then getting outs.
That was pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly got to feel good about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had given Rose a 1-0 lead two batters into the game with a
home run off Orioles ace Mike Mussina. It was his first homer since
June 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When D-Lew hit that home run,'' left fielder Troy O'Leary
said, ``we felt like we had a chance today.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary helped preserve that lead in the fourth, when he played
Jeff Conine's double deftly off the wall and threw to shortstop
Sadler, whose strong relay to the plate cut down Harold Baines, who
was originally signed by wooden-legged Bill Veeck and now, at age
41, runs like him.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler hustled his way to the Sox' second run in the top of the
fifth, turning a catchable blooper into a double, then scoring on
Jose Offerman's ground single. The Sox made it 3-1 against Mussina
when Brian Daubach led off the sixth with his eighth home run of
the season and third in the last five games, a drive into the
left-center field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, an elite pitcher in the last year of his contract, now
has given up a league-leading 14 home runs, a primary reason he is
off to the worst start of his career at 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about seven innings and three runs,'' he
said. ``I can't. I wish it would come out better. I wish we'd get
some better breaks and I wish a lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So many wishes, so little time. How about wishing that Orioles
reliever B.J. Ryan could throw a strike, instead of starting the
eighth inning by walking the bases loaded, then going 2 and 0 on
Mike Stanley before manager Mike Hargrove yanked him for Jose
Mercedes. Ryan threw 18 pitches, 14 of them balls. Stanley wound up
walking, too, which was charged to Ryan. Everyone who walked
scored.
</P>
<P>
   How about wishing that second baseman Mark Lewis had fielded
Sadler's ground ball, which skipped past him for what was
generously scored a three-run double? How about wishing that the
Sox stopped hitting, instead of going single, single, and Nixon's
two-run triple?
</P>
<P>
   How about wishing that the season somehow could start over for
the Orioles, who on May 3 were in second place, a game ahead of the
Red Sox, but now, after losing seven in a row and 11 of their last
12, are 7 1/2 games behind the first-place Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is blame for all of us,'' said Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Count the last three games of the '99 Division Series, when he
was still managing Cleveland, and his last seven games against the
Sox, Hargrove has seen his teams outscored, 79-24.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 5-1 loss, in which Orioles reliever Mike
Trombley threw only balls (four) and home run pitches (three),
Hargrove was asked if that was the season's low point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``We haven't played tomorrow yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where things stood on Mother's Day: the Orioles
approaching tomorrow with dread, Rose and the Sox approaching it as
if it can't come fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``First place?'' Lewis said. ``Awesome.''

PHOENIX RALLY DRAWS GUN FOES, FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - As thousands of mothers marched around the nation,
activists on both sides of the gun-control issue clashed in Phoenix
at Patriots Square park.
</P>
<P>
   It was moms against moms, as 600 gun-control supporters filled
the square and about 300 pro-gun protesters surrounded it during a
peaceful Mother's Day demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have a proud history of changing history,'' said Lila
Schwartz, the former League of Women Voters president, to the
rousing applause of the moms who want gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Women on both sides brought supporters: husbands, dads,
boyfriends, family members and children also carried signs and
chanted on the heated streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm protesting with dignity and don't want any
confrontations,'' said Chris McCarty, a member of the Second
Amendment Sisters, an organization for women who denounced strict
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old grandmother has her own concealed-carry permit,
but she left her weapon at home Sunday, May 14, so she wouldn't
appear threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The gun advocates surrounded the park, stationed at each
cornered entrance chanting ``Freedom!'' and holding signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Million Mom Madness: Don't lock up my right to defend our
children,'' one sign read.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-gun supporters tried to drone out pro-control speakers with
the sound of their horns as they drove by.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the park, women demanded gun registration and licensing,
longer waiting periods, manufacturer regulations and an end to
gun-show loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Several mothers, all of whom had lost loved ones to gun
violence, addressed the crowd surrounded by 60 linked children's
silhouettes made of cardboard. Each cutout stood for a child that
died this year in Arizona. A .44-caliber slug was shot through the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers reminded onlookers that they vote by wearing ``I
vote'' bumper stickers on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 12-year-old Paige Anderson of Glendale realized she
couldn't yet vote, she amended her sticker to ``I will vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Gerry Anderson, co-organized the event rather than
attend the one in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone to D.C., but I needed to be here today,''
said Anderson, whose brother was killed while on a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   The only guns allowed in the park were the ones carried by 20
Phoenix police officers who patroled the area. The gun-control
supporters had secured a permit for the park first, forcing
protesters to keep to the street.
</P>
<P>
   Not all protesters, however, left their guns at home. Douglas
Robertson, 20, protested with a dual holster attached; a Glock 9mm
on one side and a .357 Magnum revolver on the other. Together the
guns had 27 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of muggers,'' Robertson said. &QL;

   &UR; BILL GOODYKOONTZ  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients) &LR;  &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - We spend so much of our time consumed by television -
what if it consumed us literally?
</P>
<P>
   What if you woke up one day and found yourself living inside
your favorite shows, alongside your favorite (and not-so-favor ite)
characters?
</P>
<P>
   A day in the TV life:
</P>
<P>
   You awake, sweating from an other Regis nightmare in Frasier
Crane's well-appointed apart ment, with Dharma (or Greg, depending)
silently snoozing be side you. You stop on your way from the
bedroom to the kitchen to admire the Seattle skyline. Man, what
swell digs.
</P>
<P>
   But you're in a hurry - you've got to get to your job at the
White House (I know, it's in Washington, D.C., not Washington
state, but this is TV world - normal laws of reality and physics
don't apply). Best job you've ever had, work ing for President
Bartlet along side Leo, Toby, C.J. and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that your last job was anything to sneeze at. Nothing offers
the security of being safety inspector for the Spring field Nuclear
Power Plant, a job from which it is apparently im possible to be

   Walking to the car that Titus customized for you, you notice

screaming and crashing. That Malcom kid seems OK, but the other
boys drive you crazy. It would almost be funny if you didn't live
right next door.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's secretary is now your own, and the calendar she hands you
is full. Oddly, it's almost all personal stuff. For instance,
you've got to find someone to cut your hair - there is no way
you're going back to the butcher who allowed Felicity to sacrifice
her lucrative locks on the altar of young-star independence. Kids!
</P>
<P>
   You've also got to find a birth day gift for your father-in-law,
Arthur Spooner, who you can't help but notice bears a remark able
resemblance to Frank Cos tanza, only in a less-funny show.
</P>
<P>
   But first and foremost you've got to call your lawyer, Bobby
Donnell. (Yes, he's in Boston, but this is still TV, so it's a
local call with a 555 prefix.) It's good you found him - Ally over

al ways busy defending women ac cused of smothering their
89-year-old husbands with their gigantic breasts and such - an
actual plot too ridiculous even for this dream.
</P>
<P>
   No time for lunch - you've decided to buy Arthur a book. But the
only bookstore nearby is that one in Once and Again, and you'd
rather not read again than set foot in that pretentious yup pie
joint. (Plus for half the year, it occupied NYPD Blue's ad dress.)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a stabbing pain in the gut doubles you over. Even
though you've collapsed, you re fuse the Third Watch ambulance
crew's offer of a ride to the hospital, preferring to crawl the
entire distance on your belly rather than spend time with them.

   When you reach the emer gency room, Dr. Carter gives you the

Benton is busy, but luckily, Dr. Shutt has agreed to do the
operation, even though he is a neurosurgeon at a different Chi cago
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But he cancels at the last minute, and just before you're put
under, you see Dr. Hanlon - a cosmetic surgeon - heading your way

in Dumb and Dumber, you bolt, appendicitis or not, figuring that
Chicago Hope will be canceled before you get your bill, anyway.

   Happily, the pain miraculously disappears - it's TV, remember -

SET PLAYS HELP REVOLUTION STAY IN FIRST PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There is little similarity between the
success rate of free kicks in soccer and, say, free throws in
basketball, though they serve a similar purpose. In fact, only
about 10 percent of set plays result in scores in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a rare feat, indeed, that the Revolution could convert
all three of their free kicks in a 3-1 win at D.C. United Saturday
night, and rarer still that each shot was taken by a different
player.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unusual, though, is the fact that the Revolution have
been in first place in the Eastern Division of Major League Soccer
for nearly a month. They have played five straight games without a
loss for the first time in their five-year history, and a win over
Colorado Wednesday would complete their most productive six-game
stretch ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are finding ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United controlled the tempo and had the best chances to
score. But the Revolution remained composed, coach Fernando Clavijo
made effective substitutions by adding Mike Burns and William
Sunsing in the second half, and Jeff Causey saved a Jaime Moreno
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's goals occurred against the run of play. But it
is a mark of this team that it was able to capitalize. And it is an
indication of increased savvy that the Revolution were able to
raise the level of their game at crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   Each free kick was taken from nearly the same spot on the field,
about 25 yards and on the left side of the goal, not as much a
coincidence as it might seem, since the Revolution were
counterattacking and gaining the advantage on defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Wolde Harris simply lasered the first one, skimming it along the
wet RFK Stadium grass and under the D.C. wall, which jumped over
the ball in unison. Mauricio Ramos curled a left-footed free kick
around the left side of the wall in the 66th minute, and Imad Baba
curled a right-footed kick around the right side of the wall in the
82d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Each goal was set up by some resourceful individual play.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution quickly recovered after falling behind, and
Harris drew a foul from Carlos Llamosa before tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   With the Revolution under siege early in the second half,
Sunsing replaced Johnny Torres and, the first time he touched the
ball, was taken down from behind by Carey Talley. That allowed the
Revolution to readjust, and served as a warning of their ability to
counterattack, a weapon that would make the difference in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Ted Chronopoulos anticipated a United pass, then went
on a one-man counter, leading to Ramos's tiebreaking free kick.
Baba and Chronopoulos cleared away shots with Causey beaten, and
Causey saved the penalty in the 78th minute. Then, Sunsing broke
away and was fouled from behind to set up the final score.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were rewarded for persistence, resourcefulness,
and some skillful feats. But they were clearly not the superior
team, as United displayed better technique and ball movement.
Moreno gave a clinic in the midfield, though Burns discouraged him
somewhat in the second half. And the Revolution seldom played
through their midfield choreographer, Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took advantage of what they gave us and countered really
quickly,'' Harris said. ``But we need to work on possession and
where people need to be and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``My touches were not up to par. But we created our own luck and
you can't say we weren't working hard.''

NORMAN CLAIMS TITLE IN SOCCER-MAD ROME 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Eternal City went passionately pazzo _ crazy _
Sunday. A stranger might have thought that the Pope was handing out
dispensations in St. Peter's Square or Julius Caesar had
reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that minor, however. A local soccer team, Lazio, had won
the Italian championship for the first time in 26 years (only the
second in more than a century) by beating Reggina, 3-0, while
70,000 in Olympic Stadium howled and crooned. They celebrated madly
for hours, ripped up souvenir patches of the turf, and the town
went up like a Roman candle in an all-night revel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, next door, where 7,000 had gathered in the sunshine
at Il Foro Italico, many of them wearing earphones to keep track of
the game by radio, a Swede named Magnus Norman was having a happy
bash of his own on a terra cotta tennis court. Magnus's magnum opus
was the dethroning of Brazilian Guga Kuerten to win the Italian
Open, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I heard the soccer crowd, the cheering and the
singing,'' said Norman, his game's startling, unheralded leader at
No. 1, for now. ``But it didn't bother me. I wanted to know the
score myself. Lazio's my team. Why? Their coach is a Swede, Sven
Goran Eriksson, and I've met him a few times. What did bother me
was all the helicopters (police security) for the soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champ who beat
Patrick Rafter in last year's final here, was the combination of
Norman and an aching back. Kuerten, after taking an injury timeout
for treatment at 0-2 in the fourth set, played somewhat better, but
couldn't deal with his own erratic shotmaking and the Swede's
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten said his back ``was stiff'' _ surely not as stiff as
countless Romans Sunday &UR;  &LR; night _ but ``Norman was fitter than me.
You've got to be in the best fitness to play all these tough guys,
tough matches. I have to get there by the French.'' Nursing the
back, he had been out almost a month.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 23-year-old Norman's ninth career title. Although
he tied Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi for the most in 1999 (five),
none of his collection had anywhere near the cachet of the Italian,
the fourth of the season's Masters Series, the nine tournaments
rating just behind the four majors.
</P>
<P>
   Norman took over the summit of the newly minted Champions Race
from third-round loser Agassi after defeating Lleyton Hewitt in a
Saturday semifinal. Loser of merely one set (to Kuerten) all week,
the Swede said he knew he was No. 1 but ``not the best,'' not in
the universe of Sampras and Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm feeling better about No. 1,'' he said. ``I know I can
beat a big guy (Kuerten is No. 6) in a big final. I believe I'm
strong enough physically and mentally to win the French (May
29-June 11), but I've still got Hamburg and Dusseldorf before. It's
a tough schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a born and bred clay-lover, said his epiphany had
occurred last year on, of all footings, a grass court, Wimbledon.
``It was a second-round win over Fabrice Santoro. I lost the next
round to Greg Rusedski, but I left as the new Magnus Norman. I
started hitting the ball early. You have to on grass. And it felt
good. I've been doing it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach differs from the usual baseline hugging-European
dirt-kickers. Norman takes the ball sooner, and from inside the
baseline whenever he can, the Agassi-style ping pong. It kept
Kuerten running, trying to do too much to the ball with too little
time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Kuerten served poorly (48 percent to the champ's 78),
so it didn't help much that he won the ace race, 15-14. He was
constantly in the briars of break points, fending off 19 of 24. It
was a Kuerten crowd. The man impersonating a mop, in hair and
physique, is irresistible. He raised hopes by fighting off four
match points in a ragged but enthralling ninth game of the fourth
(7 deuces, 20 points, 10 minutes), to 4-5, then pushing Norman to a
break point. But Kuerten botched a forehand return, and it was soon
over in 3:10.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a lean and quick 6 feet 2 inches, the picture of
athleticism in remarkable retrieving, crushing inside-out
forehands, and leaping smashes, became the third Swedish champion
of Italy, following Bjorn Borg (1974, '78) and Mats Wilander ('88).
``I watched Mats win on TV,'' he said. ``This is an important
tournament in Sweden. I know Bjorn. We belong to the same club
(Kungliga) in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Borg left Il Foro 22 years ago vowing never to return, and
didn't. The generous Romans kept pelting him with coins because he
was beating their guy, Adriano Panatta. Money figured Sunday, too.
Norman, brought up in the small town of Filipstad, known for its
bakeries and bread, departed with more bread ``than I ever dreamed
of'' _ $400,000. It descended on him in a check, not silver.

1ST INTEL SPINOFF FOR STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER AND JANE LARSON  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - After 21 years in Arizona, Intel Corp. spins off its
first new company into the state economy today, May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, maker of the chips that power most of the world's
computers, is debuting an Internet-based company,
DevelopOnline.com, which enhances collaboration among companies
that make products such as cellular phones and software.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones and many other appliances are built very
differently, with one company designing the product and its
components and building it from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   That's starting to change, with companies like Qualcomm Inc.
licensing a key technology to others instead of making phones
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   DevelopOnline will use the Internet to create a sort of online
workshop. A small start-up company with a new antenna for a cell
phone, for example, could electronically browse for a phone from
one manufacturer and a battery from another, then build a virtual
model to see if the pieces work together.
</P>
<P>
   The system would reduce from years to months the time it takes
to convert a concept into a product, said Alan Steinberg, one of
Intel's first employees when it moved to Chandler and the new
firm's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the new system could be compared to the way
personal computer manufacturers build their products, buying
components from many manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see Dell doing a lot of development work,''
Steinberg said. ``They're an assembler.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's clout attracted $15 million in out-of-state venture
capital from 3i Technology Partners, a $300 million fund based in
Palo Alto, Calif., and Carlyle Venture Partners, a $210 million
fund and part of Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle Group.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based eStreetCapital.com will invest up to $500,000 in the
spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hald, a MicroAge co-founder and co-chairman of the
governor's task force on the new economy, said he expected the
out-of-town money to lead to investment in other Arizona companies.
</P>
<P>
   To make the whole thing work, Steinberg must convince other
major electronics companies to become strategic partners that would
assemble a sort of library of proven technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Intel decided to spin off the firm to venture
capitalists to make it easier to attract other major players.
</P>
<P>
   The company launches with 30 former Intel employees. It will
move to Tempe's Mill Avenue CenterPoint development in September.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg plans to have 100 employees by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   A hot technology idea spilling out of a big-name company is a
common story in the Silicon Valley, but it's a first for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole point of the New Economy,'' said Ed Denison,
president of the Arizona Software and Internet Association. ``This
is how most regions do it.'' &QL;

SADLER QUICKLY BECOMING A FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ When the weekend began, Donnie Sadler was wearing
Red Sox, that would be Pawtucket-issue red socks, and he was
playing out his baseball dream in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the minors is all part of it, I guess,'' said Sadler,
who lost out on a roster spot in Boston when the Sox fled Florida
last month. ``When I got sent down, it was definitely frustrating,
but that's all just part of what you have to learn to overcome.
Yeah, I got sent down, but it wasn't like it was career-ending, or
they were saying, `You've had your shot and you're not coming
back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's days in the minors looked forgotten for good Sunday in
Boston's 10-1 thumping of the Orioles. Batting ninth, he knocked in
three runs with a pair of doubles. He also finished off the
defensive gem of the day as the relay man in the fourth-inning
cutting down of Harold Baines at the plate, preventing what would
have been the tying run for the struggling Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler can run. In fact, he may have the fastest set of legs in
the American League. He also can throw the leather, be it at
shortstop, where he was Sunday, or filling a hole in the outfield.
And Saturday's homer, coupled with his two-hit, three-RBI
performance Sunday, showed that he has the stick to stay
comfortably north of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big guns are out,'' said Boston center fielder Darren
Lewis, referring to injuries to Nomar Garciaparra (hamstring) and
Carl Everett (quadriceps). ``But that doesn't matter. We've got
guys that can play. Guys like Scott Hatteberg, Jeff Frye, and
Donnie Sadler _ they're a big part of our success, and they don't
get the credit they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's contribution wasn't lost on Sox starter _ and winner _
Brian Rose (3-2). If not for Sadler's laser peg to the plate to cut
down Baines, Rose would have been working with a 1-1 tie and a
runner (Jeff Conine) in scoring position. Instead, the inning was
finished after the O'Leary-to-Sadler-to-Jason Varitek relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say thanks, first, to the defense,'' said Rose.
``Sadler played some tremendous defense, and he got that clutch
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's other fine finish came in the eighth, admittedly with
little pressure with the Sox in command, 10-1. Ranging to his left,
he cut down a hot Albert Belle shot, recovered the loose ball, and
fired across to erase Belle by a half-step.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit that pretty hard,'' said Sadler. ``That gave me the
time to make the play, and (Mike Stanley) made a nice play picking
up my one-hopper.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-inning relay to cut down Baines had Sadler meandering
to shallow left-center as O'Leary fielded Conine's ball off the
wall. It took a nice play to pick up O'Leary's throw, turn toward
the plate, and fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jose) Offerman is the trailer there, and I've got to go on
what he's telling me, whether the play's at third or home,'' said
Sadler. ``And he was yelling, `Four . . . four . . . four.' So I
turned and threw as hard as I could, and it happened to be on the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's depth that wins pennants, more than power hitting, more
than speed, often more than pitching. Sadler looked like a perfect
``depth'' guy as spring training progressed, but the Sox were
hooked on the idea of keeping Gary Gaetti (since retired) and
relying more on Frye and Andy Sheets to be the depth guys.
</P>
<P>
   But all that began to change when Garciaparra hurt his leg
running out a grounder in the first inning Thursday night. By the
bottom of the inning, the All-Star shortstop was headed to the
15-day disabled list, and by the end of the night the call was
being made to Toledo for Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler arrived here on a broken relay of sorts. His itinerary,
Toledo to Pittsburgh to Baltimore, left him here without his
luggage. He had to scurry around the clubhouse for a glove
(Garciaparra's) and cleats (Frye's) to get back in the bigs. By the
third inning Sunday, his luggage arrived.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday, he was doing everything but singing the anthem,
selling hot dogs, and heating up the popcorn machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in that precarious position of wanting to keep it all
going, but knowing that Garciaparra's return is inevitable and
Everett's injury is not long term. When the big guns come back, the
little guys, the depth destroyers, have to wait their turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that really doesn't matter to me,'' he said. ``It's
all part of knowing your role. Right now, Nomar's got to take a
break, and I've got to go out there and show I can be consistent _
be consistent and wait your turn, and hope it all works out all
right.''

NY LOVES CHARLIE'S HUSTLE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's fitting that in an NBA playoff series that keeps
stats on third-down efficiency and red zone scoring, the player who
wins the game is a former Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have Seven Blocks of Granite. The Heat have Monsters
of the Key Biscayne Causeway. This is smashmouth basketball and the
team that blocks and tackles best is probably going to win.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfect setting for Charlie Ward. The guy who torched
Nebraska in the 1994 Orange Bowl to win Bobby Bowden's first
national championship at Florida State scored the Knicks' final 9
points in a 91-83 victory over Miami Sunday. This Eastern
Conference semifinal is tied, 2-2, and commissioner David Stern
gets more drudgery in the only remaining competitive series of the
final four.
</P>
<P>
   In 32 Mother's Day minutes at Madison Square Garden, the
6-foot-2-inch Ward finished with 20 points on 8-for-13 shooting (3
of 6 from international waters) and added 7 rebounds, 4 assists,
and 3 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a consummate pro,'' said Heat coach Pat Riley. ``The play
that said it all about him came at the end of the game when he ran
down a loose ball, pirouetted as he was diving out of bounds, then
threw a down-and-out pass (to Latrell Sprewell).''
</P>
<P>
   In those final minutes, when the game was on the line, Ward was
everywhere, burying jumpers, saving loose balls, and hitting a John
Havlicekian bank shot as he floated down the lane, off-balance,
with 1:51 left.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year veteran (Ward and Patrick Ewing are the only active
Knicks who played for Riley) is not given to great quotations or
animation. New York columnists dread Ward interviews. The sessions
are bore-fests laced with abject Dukespeak and praises for the
Almighty. Sunday, on the day he enjoyed his career playoff high,
Ward had a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I should have my own team,'' he said with a smile.
``For the first time, I felt like Allan Houston and Latrell. But
I've been in that position before, in football, where you're the
man and everyone is looking to you to make the plays and you make
the plays. (Today), I felt like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like that. Miami was within 5 points, close to taking a
virtually insurmountable 3-1 series lead, when Ward took over.
First, he rebounded an Alonzo Mourning free throw miss. Then he
made the diving save and the down-and-out pass. Then he scored on
the funky drive to push the lead to 7. After a Mourning dunk, Ward
canned a 12-footer, and finally a stake-driving 3-pointer with 36
seconds left to make it 91-81. Ballgame. It was Ward's best finish
since he beat the Cornhuskers in Miami in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie always plays like that,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy. ``You can count on him to hustle on a nightly basis.
Whatever you emphasize to the team, Charlie tries to do. He
rebounds and hustles. He tries to do exactly what we need and we
need more people to follow his lead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rough NBA ride for Ward. A native of Georgia, he was
a good enough athlete to win the Heisman Trophy and get drafted in
baseball (Brewers in 1993 and Yankees in '94) and basketball (a
Knicks first-round pick in '94). Like Doug Flutie, he was
considered too small and tricky for the NFL. San Francisco genius
Bill Walsh was known to say that Ward had the instincts and winning
ways of Joe Montana. But Ward served notice that he would play
basketball unless he was drafted in the NFL's first round _ he went
unselected in the '94 football meat market.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans and media have portrayed him as a hustling guy who
might be playing the wrong sport. Every high school basketball team
has one or two football studs moonlighting on hardwood and Ward's
never been embraced like Earl Monroe, or even Micheal Ray
Richardson. He's not flashy and he's not a thug, which makes him an
aberration in his own locker room. He's the slow and steady fire.
That's why it was so weird to have Woody Allen, Soon-Yi, David
Duchovny, and Tea Leone standing and chanting his name at the end
of a playoff game.

<P>
   ``I'm happy for him,'' said Sprewell. ``Especially when you're
here, at home. If it wasn't for Charlie, this would have been
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tremendous for us,'' added teammate Kurt Thomas. ``He
did everything he was asked to do _ diving on the floor, getting
after balls, blocking shots, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   America cares little about the Heat and Knicks _ 24 guys who
could not have been the men who shot Liberty Valance _ but Gotham
is agog. Only Rudy Giuliani's love life is bigger these days. Even
though the games are ugly, folks can't wait for the next Garden
Party Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Wednesday in Miami _ where Charlie Ward did his best
work on the gridiron all those years ago.

INSTEAD OF FADING, SUNS LOOK LIKE SUNS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If the motivation is either death or a mini-vacation,
seems you'd best opt for lights out as the greater inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns, left for dead by most, looked very much alive
Sunday afternoon in Game 4 of their playoff series against the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns played like the team that won 53 games in the regular
season. Jason Kidd like a star with a healthy ankle. Cliff Robinson
like the guy seen in the regular season. Rodney Rogers like the one
who just won the NBA's Sixth Man award.
</P>
<P>
   Disobedient like, the Suns were told to play dead and instead
took a bite out of the Lakers' postseason plans, jumping out to a
commanding lead and then never letting up in a 117-98 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have swept the series with a victory Sunday and
had nearly a week off before the next round. Instead, they came out
flat and never rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was, we knew they were very overconfident,''
Suns guard Penny Hardaway said. ``We knew that they weren't going
to come out and play hard from the beginning. They wanted to just
coast like they have in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got going, they couldn't turn it back on. It was
fortunate for us that they came out with such a lackadaisical
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led by 14 at the end of the first quarter and by 23 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers smelled blood, it was their own. They trailed by
29 points at one point and never got closer than 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they came out and were going to see how we were going
to attack,'' Kidd said. ``We felt like if we were just going to
throw in the towel, they were going to jump on us. I think they
found out early that we were coming to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said a key was to jump on the Lakers early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides Game 1, they really haven't come out and attacked us
in either game,'' he said. ``They've been kind of coasting, turning
it on, turning it off. They've been able to put runs together to
come back on us at will. If we get a lead, we have to protect it
and make them fight a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns got a superb overall game from Kidd, who turned a
triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and a career playoff-high
16 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a stat line,'' Kidd said. ``To me, the important
thing is we got the win. I felt good, the ball was going in today,
and I was being more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, shooting just .292 percent in the first three games, was 8
of 13 from the field and hit 4 of 6 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been under attack for disappearing in the
postseason - his career scoring average is six points less in the
playoffs (10.3) than the regular season. And he was plagued Sunday
with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where everything started to
click,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers shot .486 from the field in the regular season and .439
from the 3-point line. In the first three games against the Lakers,
he shot .306 percent and missed on all 12 of his 3-point attempts.
Sunday he scored 17 points (6 of 11, and two 3-pointers).
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time our offense is rolling like this, we're tough to
beat,'' Hardaway said. ``If we can roll like this in L.A., we'll be
getting another one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' said Kidd, ``we're back in this series.''

LAKERS NEED A BIT MORE WORK ON KNOCKOUT PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Obviously the Los Angeles Lakers heard all the people
prematurely dissecting their Western Conference finals matchup with
Portland and got disoriented. They came out Sunday against the Suns
and played like that was Rasheed Wallace in Cliff Robinson's body
and Brian Grant in Corie Blount's and Scottie Pippen in Rodney
Rogers'.
</P>
<P>
   All those Lakers flaws the Trail Blazers were going to expose in
the next round, the Suns exploited in a 117-98 victory at America
West Arena that forced a Game 5 in the best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinal series. It will take place Tuesday at the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' lack of a capable backup center loomed large when
Shaquille O'Neal picked up three fouls in the first half and was
saddled with five by the eighth minute of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was their patchwork bench, which was hanging by a
thread by halftime. Buoyed by Blount and Rogers, the Suns' reserves
outscored their Lakers counterparts 17-8 in the opening 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And power forward never looked more like an oxymoron than when
describing the Lakers' A.C. Green, who was powerless to stop
Robinson. Just a few minutes into the game it was obvious the
sprained ankle that cast some doubt as to whether or not he would
be able to play Sunday would bother Robinson more than Green would.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-year veteran blew through the Lakers' defense like a
tornado. The devastation he wrought was absolute: 23 points in his
first 21 minutes and 32 points and nine rebounds for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was so ugly, coach Phil Jackson minced few words when he
briefly joined the players in the locker room at halftime. ``He
basically told us that we needed to get our butts in gear,'' said
guard Glen Rice, who had a hard time getting out of first, missing
10 of 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you didn't need six NBA championship rings to come up
with Jackson's pearl of wisdom. Anybody could see the Lakers were
badly outhustled from the start.
</P>
<P>
   But of course. The Lakers always seem to play this way in Game 4
of a possible sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd slipped the Suns into fifth gear as though he were at
the controls of a Ferrari, dishing out eight of his 16 assists in
the first quarter as the Suns' transition game whirred. In the
first half alone, they had 12 fast-break points to the Lakers'
four.
</P>
<P>
   All you really need to know about the Lakers' get-up-and-go is
this: Kidd, sore left ankle and all, finished as the game's high
rebounder with 10. He had eight defensive boards, more than any
Laker had altogether save for Robert Horry and O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Robinson and Kidd, the Suns hung 71 points on the
scoreboard in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers wish that was a typo.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Miami basketball fans who caught a glimpse of the
71-48 halftime score on their way out the door to dinner probably
assumed it was a final.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, the Lakers wouldn't have minded if a mercy rule
had spared them from having to play the second half. By the time
the fourth quarter rolled around, the Lakers were so
discombobulated Rick Fox was acting like Portland's tempestuous
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was ejected with 3:27 remaining and the Lakers trailing by
20 when he collected his second technical foul for venting his
frustrations about having Robinson's sneaker prints all over his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant chose another way - one no less curious - to try to
save a little face. At one point in the fourth quarter he sidled up
to Blount, a former Lakers teammate, and said, ``We need the
practice. I'm glad you all did this to us. See you in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   That Kobe, he's such a kidder. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said Blount, who got bent all over again
when he recounted the conversation. ``I think he was very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was right about one thing; the Lakers need a lot of
practice on their knockout punch. They showed in Game 3 in
Sacramento in the first round of the playoffs and again here on
Sunday that it doesn't carry much sting.
</P>
<P>
   Green carried the analogy one step further. ``We haven't proved
that we have a knockout punch yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Lakers had the Suns down for the count, the fact
they couldn't put them away really hurt. The Lakers, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a shame,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. One game does not a series change. The Suns don't have
the Lakers on the ropes. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers can put the ``gel'' back in Los Angeles by coming
together Tuesday and playing 48 minutes of inspired defense. You
know, like they did way back in Game 1 of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling we have is that we've got to come out Tuesday and
return the favor,'' Rice said. ``If we're going to be a contender
for a championship we can't have lapses like we did (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most accurate Rice had been all afternoon.

NORTHRIDGE TAKES NCAA SOFTBALL PLAYOFF BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They earned their reprieve. Now to see what
they'll do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge softball team learned Sunday night it
qualified for the NCAA Tournament for the ninth consecutive season.
The Matadors will face Arkansas in a double-elimination regional in
Norman, Okla., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   What happens now is up to the players. For the past three
seasons, CSUN has been undone by infighting and bickering.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and '99, the bad blood surfaced in the postseason and
the team quickly exited from the regionals. This time, it happened
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Northridge was sailing along, leading the Big West
Conference at 13-1. It dropped one game to Long Beach State, then
lost three more at Fullerton. Goodbye conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Outside influences (mostly parents and fans) started whispering
to some players that coach Janet Sherman a) wasn't coaching well;
b) wasn't using them correctly; c) both. Some players listened,
others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was dissension. It got worse as the losses
mounted. Players started arguing about on-the-field play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like dominoes,'' pitcher Sarah Farnworth said. ``All this
fighting is petty. We know we're good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the Matadors dropped two of three against UC Santa
Barbara, it was hello postseason uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman hoped a week off, followed by a regular-season-closing
weekend at Utah State would help.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors split Friday, then won Saturday to finish 26-24-1
the fewest number of victories at CSUN since a 17-14 record in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Yet strength of schedule helped. Northridge won 18 games over
ranked teams (although, they lost to Arkansas 1-0 in a tournament)
and lost only once to an unranked nonconference opponent
(Tennessee).
</P>
<P>
   So now, the Matadors find themselves in a familiar place:
bickering into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   If they remain united, they could win the region. If not, it
could be a quick two and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the B.S.,'' outfielder Jessica Creith said, ``the
only way we can go is up.''
</P>
<P>
   What losses mean: In Marquis Brignac, the football team loses
depth at running back. The loss of Hassan Abdul-Malik, however, is
tantamount to losing Ronnie Lott.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what Northridge football coach Jeff Kearin
says.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin wanted to build the defense around Abdul-Malik, the
5-foot-10, 185-pound sophomore who redshirted last season. Kearin
also wanted to put him on the cover of this season's media guide
and tout him as a preseason All-American.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that will happen because Abdul-Malik and Brignac, a
former Taft High of Woodland Hills standout, are heading to Valley
College.
</P>
<P>
   Brignac already has withdrawn from school. Abdul-Malik is
finishing the semester.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik, who sat out last season with a hamstring injury,
said he's leaving because he doesn't believe the administration
supports football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not experiencing that college football atmosphere at
Northridge,'' he said. ``I see the interest in students is going
down the drain. Nobody talks about football. I know people that
don't think we have football. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik said he considered Pasadena City and Mt. San Antonio
colleges but chose Valley because former Northridge coach Ron
Ponciano is an assistant there.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin calls the departure ``a big loss to the program. I
thought we had addressed his concerns.''

HULL, LEGISLATORS NO CLOSER TO FIX OF SCHOOL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHRIS MOESER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - On one side stand legislative leaders looking for ways
to raise $300 million more a year for education without Gov. Jane
Hull's sales tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   On the other is Hull herself, vowing to battle on for her 0.6 of
a cent tax increase for teacher pay, smaller class sizes,
universities and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of meetings, neither side is talking of compromise.
But each suggests that the other is caving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's garbage,'' Hull aide Jaime Molera said about rumors
spread by opponents that Hull had abandoned her plan. ``The
leadership had not engaged the issue, so the governor challenged
them to come up with something.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, said: ``The governor found
in talking to my members that the tax increase was going over like
a lead balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost and Senate President Brenda Burns remain steadfastly
opposed to a tax increase. Both are pursuing alternatives to Hull's
plan that could take weeks or months to work out, suggesting that a
special session on the issue could come this summer rather than
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling it could almost unravel before we get
started,'' said Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Hull aides remain convinced that if they called a session in two
weeks, a plan close to the governor's would pass. At the end of the
regular session, for example, 18 senators said they supported the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders say otherwise. And they have the power to make
any special session a rough one.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost is looking at three areas: across-the-board budget cuts
in non-education areas; closing tax loopholes or adding taxes for
services not currently taxed; and using some of the state's $3.1
billion tobacco settlement. Other ideas also have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are ways to fund this at the level the governor
wants to without a tax increase,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's tax produces $450 million a year. Groscost is
shooting for about $300 million, or the amount in Hull's plan that
would go directly to the classroom. He favors eliminating the extra
money for colleges and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities right now are not in a crisis,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested $100 million to $120 million could be found in
budget cuts. He refused to offer examples, adding that staffers are
preparing a menu of potential cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime lawmakers predicted a long, nasty fight over cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The tax ``loopholes'' Groscost and others are examining include
sales tax exemptions on lottery tickets, legal and accounting fees,
newspaper advertising, and service industry areas that aren't
taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost sees up to $500 million in such exemptions. From that
list, he predicted lawmakers could come up with an additional $100
million to $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including Burns and Gerard, argue that closing such
exemptions would be the equivalent of raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And Burns, R-Glendale, says such structural changes could take
months to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can do something significant for education
without increasing taxes or dramatically changing the tax base,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized that any money for education must be spent in the
classrooms and not on bureaucracy. Burns and Groscost point out
that education funding has increased dramatically in the past three
years but that few of those dollars have reached teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is also interested in another plan that would send
education money directly to schools, bypassing school boards and
district offices. But that idea also would take months to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Hull will continue her tour of the state to
pitch the sales tax. She has hinted that if lawmakers fail to act,
she would take to the campaign trail, backing lawmakers and
candidates who support her.
</P>
<P>
   Molera didn't downplay the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue even at the presidential level,'' he said.
``We still hold out hope they'll do something. The governor is
going to continue to push this as long as it takes.'' &QL;

`UNWANTED CHILD' SUIT OUTRAGES VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY DOUG CARROLL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - It has kept people outraged and astonished. It's a case
people haven't been able to stop talking about.
</P>
<P>
   And today, the end is in sight for the medical malpractice trial
in which a Phoenix woman is suing her doctors for failing to
diagnose her pregnancy in time for her to get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are scheduled in Ruth Ann Burns' lawsuit,
which claims that her 2-year-old son Nicholas resulted from an
unwanted pregnancy. She is demanding compensation from her doctors
until the child is 18.
</P>
<P>
   Her case has been a flash point, raising deep-seated emotions
about birth control, abortion, parenting, selfishness, the legal
system itself. It also has stirred a group of parents and
legislators to rally against her at the state Capitol today.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions kicked into overdrive in midweek, when her live-in
boyfriend, David Gomez, told the court that Nicholas is ``a
lifelong mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of situation that speaks to people in an
immediate way,'' said Dan Strouse, a law professor at Arizona State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said he paid for three abortions for Burns, a fact not
lost on abortion opponents. The couple have one other child
together.
</P>
<P>
   Even legal experts are surprised that a settlement wasn't
reached before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case serves as a reminder that some women who are able to
bear children do not want them, just as some who want them seem
destined not to bear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual claim, to say the least,'' ASU law Professor
Paul Bender says.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse, who teaches health-care law, said the Burns lawsuit
falls between two classes of malpractice cases: wrongful
conception, such as a negligent sterilization procedure, and
wrongful life, such as a deformity or abnormality in the fetus that
goes undetected. In malpractice law, he said, it is ``a cardinal
principle'' that misdiagnosis does not per se establish negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's concern about the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas may always question his parents' love, and this may
affect his ability to trust others and form relationships, since a
child's first relationships are with his parents,'' said Linda
Caterino, a Mesa child psychologist. ``He may also suffer from low
self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Arciniega, a professor of counseling psychology at ASU,
recommends the family get into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd better know how to deal with him, or he'll be
traumatized for the rest of his life,'' Arciniega said.
</P>
<P>
   The case also strikes a nerve with couples trying to have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love a one-on-one with these people,'' said Amy
Natter, 39, of Gilbert. She has a 5-year-old son and is now nine
weeks pregnant via in vitro fertilization _ at an out-of-pocket
cost of more than $9,000 to her and her husband, Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the financial burden, the emotional price is steep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very draining,'` said Stacey Burns, 30, of Gilbert, who
is not related to Ruth Ann Burns. She has spent the past three
years trying to become pregnant and now is considering adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through a lot of wondering why. You've got to have a
strong marriage to go through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption discover also is expensive: $10,000 to $30,000 for a
child from another country and up to $15,000 for an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me so upset, I can't even compose myself,'' Stacey
Burns said of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Single parents, for whom parenting can tax emotional and
financial reserves, also have had trouble understanding the view of
Nicholas' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Diffie, 48, of Phoenix, has a 9-year-old daughter who was
unexpected. He and his former wife had been told they wouldn't be
able to have children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But unexpected is not the same as unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You accept the responsibility,'' Diffie says. ``You do the
things that come with the job (of parenting). You find a way to
make it work.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ If, as many in both clubhouses believe, the
two best teams in the American League West met this weekend in
Oakland, the A's are a leg up on the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are also one-half game up on the Mariners in the West
after Oakland's 7-2 victory over Seattle Sunday, the A's taking
three of four from the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accurate to say that the A's walked all over the
Mariners. It would be equally accurate to say that the Mariners
walked all over themselves. Not just Sunday, when Mariner pitchers
walked 10 batters, but on the road trip, with Seattle issuing 44
walks in seven games (2-5).
</P>
<P>
   That's an average of almost seven walks per game, and you don't
have to be Noah Webster to know that spells trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in this pitching staff,'' distraught pitching
coach Bryan Price said. ``That's why this is so disappointing. I'm
an understanding guy, but I'm getting to the point where I don't
understand the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is OK, but our execution of the plan is what I don't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Price's pitchers are all but conceding the first
pitch of each at-bat. Sixty percent of the pitches Seattle has
thrown this year have been for strikes, but only 53 of the first
pitches have been strikes. That's led to the Mariners pitching from
behind in the count. And that goes directly to the strength of
opposing offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle began the road trip ranked second in the AL for fewest
walks. They've since fallen to seventh, a tumultuous tumble this
deep into a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're overloading the offense,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Mariners are scoring enough runs to win, even
if they only picked up two Sunday. Piniella figures the M's scored
enough to win five of the seven games on the trip. To lose five of
the seven rankled both Piniella and Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers are asking too much of the hitters when they're
giving up eight runs a game,'' Price said. ``To tell the offense
they've got to score 10 runs for us to win a game on the road
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basics of pitching haven't changed. You need to get ahead,
you need to make the hitter defensive and you need to let the
hitters get themselves out. This is nothing new. But we're not
sticking to the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-game road trip has been little more than a succession
of walks that led to runs. And, eventually, defeat. Of the 44
opponents who drew walks on the trip, 13 scored. Three more came
with the bases loaded, driving in runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of the same Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the six walks allowed by starter Paul Abbott resulted
in runs. A two-out, two-run homer by Miguel Tejada in the second
and a two-out, three-run homer by Jason Giambi in the fourth were
both triggered by walks. If Matt Stairs doesn't walk in the second
and Terrence Long doesn't walk in the fourth, Tejada and Giambi
don't get to hammer their points home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to give up runs, you want to a see a line
like, `one run, three hits,' '' Price said. ``Instead, what I'm
seeing is `two runs, one hit.' I don't know what the problem is,
but I know that we'll solve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes to get this turned around, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Seattle heads home for a series in Safeco against Minnesota
while Oakland basks in the glow of taking three of four from the
team the A's privately suggest _ but won't publicly admit _ is the
team they have to beat if they want to win the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all going to be about pitching,'' A's manager Art Howe
said. ``The team that wins this division is going to get better
pitching than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on that, the A's have to like their chances. Sunday's
starter Gil Heredia has a 2.52 ERA after allowing two runs in 52/3
innings against the Mariners. That's the third-best ERA in the
league behind Pedro Martinez and Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Abbott's ERA is soaring toward the stratosphere since
he joined the rotation. Starting twice on this road trip, Abbott
has allowed 10 runs in 92/3 innings and his six-walk, seven-run,
four-inning effort Sunday was as painful for him to pitch as it was
for his teammates to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be effective when you can only throw one pitch for a
strike,'' Abbott said. ``I could throw the fastball for strikes,
but nothing else. I was brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I was trying to do too much, but I struggled
with the changeup all day. What I did, basically, was make it easy
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the A's need much help. Giambi had nine RBIs in the
four-game series and the A's, twice four games under .500 (4-8 and
9-13), have won 11 of their past 16 to move ahead of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where we sit,'' said Giambi, the major league leader in
homers (16) and RBIs (46). ``It's nice to be here. Everyone
predicted us to live up to this, and it's nice to be doing well
after we started out so poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are on the other side of that coin. Seattle started
out quickly, twice getting to five games over .500, but since being
13-8, the M's have dropped nine of their past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching,'' Piniella said, ``has to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a hurry.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TODAY: The Avalanche's record with Ray Borque is ... hey, forget
that for a second. Without him, they're 3-0 in the playoffs. His
injured leg may not be ready for him to come back tonight, but if
he doesn't ... let's just say, the Avs aren't that worried anymore.
NHL playoffs: Colorado at Dallas, Game 2; ESPN, 4 p.m. (ESPN has
Game 3 at Colorado, Friday at 5 p.m. and ABC has Game 4, Sunday at
noon) &QL; 
TUESDAY: No matter how many times you think a sweep will happen,
something comes along to goof it up. Then again, Jerry Buss isn't
complaining about another night of revenue. NBA playoffs: Phoenix
at Lakers, Game 5, FSN, 7:30 p.m. (If necessary, Channel 9 and TNT
have Thursday's Game 6 from Phoenix and NBC has Saturday's Game 7
from L.A.). &QL; 
WEDNESDAY: Tonight, a very special two-hour series finale of
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' But before that, Fox's other franchise
from Beverly Hills, Kevin Brown, pitches a day game at Wrigley
Field. When he's through with his latest no-decision, he's no doubt
inviting the brass back to his hotel suite for a viewing party.
MLB: Dodgers at Chicago, FSN2, 11:15 a.m. (FSN2 also has Tuesday's
Dodgers-Cubs game at 5 p.m. and Thursday's game at 11:15 a.m.) &QL; 
THURSDAY: New Jersey's Larry Robinson used to coach the Kings. So
did Roger Neilsen (although the Flyers have elected to keep him off
the bench as he recovers from cancer treatment). And Barry Melrose,
another Kings coach, will be giving his opinions on the series for
ESPN. What does it all mean? Andy Murray has a great future ahead
of him. NHL playoffs: Philadelphia at New Jersey, Game 3; ESPN,
4:30 p.m. (ESPN also has Tuesday's Game 2 from Philadelphia at 4
p.m. and Saturday's Game 4 from New Jersey at 4:30 p.m.) &QL; 
FRIDAY: After five consecutive losses to begin their AFL existence,
this is the game they're finally gonna win. If there's anything we
have to avenge, it's Houston getting the NFL over L.A. Arena
Football League: Houston at Avengers, FSN2, 7 p.m. &QL; 
SATURDAY: The last three horses who won the Kentucky Derby - Silver
Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic - also won the Preakness but fell
short of winning the Belmont Stakes in the final strides. But none
of them was the favorite in the Derby like Fusaichi Pegasus. The
Foo Fighter, everyone's Triple Crown favorite now, best not reveal
any weakness in the Preakness or he'll shatter too many dreams.
Horse racing: Preakness Stakes, Channel 7, 2:27 p.m. &QL; 
SUNDAY: So there'll be Elgin ``EBay'' Baylor in a familiar spot -
sitting behind the Clippers logo, clueless, waiting to see if they
have enough Ping-Pong balls to get the No.1 overall choice. Then,
in a new twist, they offer the pick on the Internet to the highest
bidder. NBA draft lottery, Channel 4, approx. 1:30 p.m. (at
halftime of the 12:30 p.m. playoff game in this slot). &QL;

<P>
   SAFRICA-CRIME (Kwamashu, South Africa) _ In this impoverished
township of mud shacks and stunted dreams, the killers prowl, the
bullets sing and most people no longer hope for justice. And when a
national team of inspectors visited the local police station last
year, they quickly discovered why. More than 200 criminal cases
were assigned to detectives who were either dead or dismissed from
the force, the team's confidential report shows. By Rachel L.

   PHILIPPINES-LOVEBUG (Manila, Philippines) _ If what local
investigators suspect is true, the virus that brought some of the
world's most sophisticated computer networks to a halt this month
was hatched in a noisy inner-city neighborhood where residents live
under corrugated steel roofs and raise fighting cocks in their
front yards. By Wayne Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-WARCRIMES (Djakovica, Yugoslavia) _ With winter over, teams
from the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague,
Netherlands, have resumed their digging in Kosovo, searching for
bodies and other clues that would back the indictment of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four of his top allies
in Serbia on charges of genocide committed before and during NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia last spring. So far, in the 195 sites
examined last year, the number of bodies found has been less than
initially reported to the tribunal _ in part because of apparent
Serbian tampering with the graves. But the investigators have 300
sites to examine this year, and in just three weeks this spring
have exhumed 160 bodies. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-POLITICS (Lima, Peru) _ Two weeks before the final round of

preparing to steal enough votes to ensure he wins a third term. By
Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-PRESIDENT (Istanbul, Turkey) _ The inauguration of a
reform-minded judge as Turkey's 10th president on Tuesday will cap
a year of extraordinary change here. The choice of Sezer seems to

that, taken together, suggest that Turkey may be ready to embrace
political reform. By Stephen Kinzer.

   GENE-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Some patients have become wary about
providing their tissue for genetic research. In fact, a few have
demanded money up front before providing tissue. Others are writing
contracts spelling out what they are entitled to if they help
scientists find genes. Some experts on patent law say that it would
be unfortunate if patients start demanding financial rewards for
participating in genetic research. A special report. By Gina

   L.A.-FED-CONTROL (Los Angeles) _ The Justice Department's
announcement last week that it was prepared to file a civil rights
lawsuit against the Police Department was embarrassing news for
this city. But it was only the latest in a series of federal
actions and oversight efforts that in some important ways have made
greater Los Angeles a virtual ward of Washington. By Todd S.

Persian Gulf War, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, came under investigation
after a member of his unit complained that his troops had pummeled
retreating Iraqi forces in an unprovoked attack two days after a
cease-fire went into effect. Military investigators, who fielded
the anonymous complaint and completed a secret report in 1991,
exonerated McCaffrey. But questions about the attack were revived
this week by a magazine report that quotes senior Army officers,
including an officer who fought alongside McCaffrey, as saying the
attack was unjustified. By Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   ECON-LIMITS (Washington) _ The Fed's great experiment in letting
the economy run in order to test the limits of how much growth can
be achieved without inflation appears to be nearing an end. Judging
that rapid advances in technology were making businesses and
workers more productive in ways that tempered upward pressure on
prices, the Fed instead has given the economy more or less free
rein to find its own limits. It may now have found them. By Richard
W. Stevenson.

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ever wonder why managers fret over those final
days of spring training, when it's time to figure out which
pitchers to keep, or which pitchers to send to the minors, or
perhaps, release?
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels proved why a No. 9 or No. 10 pitcher on a
roster is so important during its 7-6, come-from-behind victory
Sunday over the Texas Rangers at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Jason Dickson wobbled through 1 innings, leaving
his team trailing 5-2 and with runners on first and second. At that
point, the Rangers already had five runs and six hits, and 10 of
their first 14 hitters had reached base successfully.
</P>
<P>
   By the eighth inning, Texas still had five runs and six hits,
and the Angels, thanks to a pair of two-run homers by Mo Vaughn and
a solo shot from Garret Anderson, had forged a tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Al Levine (3 innings), Eric Weaver (one inning) and
Mark Petkovsek (one inning) pitched no-hit ball over the next 5
innings, retiring 14 in a row at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of the week,'' Angels' manager Mike Scioscia said of
his relievers. ``These guys not only are stepping out of their
roles, but out of their comfort areas as well in terms of where
they like to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (2-0) ended up getting the win in relief,
going the final two innings and surviving Ivan Rodriguez's go-ahead
homer in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker still stable: The status of Angels pitcher Kent Mercker
was unchanged Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker will remain hospitalized at UC Irvine Medical Center
this week while doctors perform additional tests, including another
arteriogram, in an effort to determine the cause of Mercker's
cerebral hemorrhage. He remains in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Wetteland: Both Troy Glaus' game-tying and Scott
Spiezio's game-winning, ninth-inning homers came off Texas reliever
Francisco Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas entering the ninth inning with a one-run lead, one
might ask where was closer John Wetteland?
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland recorded heavy-maintenance saves Friday and Saturday,
and Rangers' manager Johnny Oates stuck with Cordero, who had not
allowed a homer in 19 innings entering Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to even out my mail,'' Oates joked. ``It's
been running overwhelmingly against bringing John in, and I want to
even it out with people ripping me for not bringing him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Spiezio broke an 0-for-11 drought when he went deep to
win it for the Angels. ... Vaughn's two homers gave him three
multiple-homer games this season and 27 for his career (25 of which
are two-homer games). ... The Angels have hit 39 homers over their
last 20 games, and both the Angels and Rangers combined to hit 22
(13 by Anaheim) during this four-game series.

   ``HALF A HEART''
</P>
<P>
   By ROSSELLEN BROWN
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Vener is a doctor's wife whose perfect life in suburban
Houston includes an elegant house, walk-in closets, good clothes,
terrific husband and kids. She knows, however, that if her old
friends (who are no longer her friends) came to visit, they ``would
have trouble getting past the gatehouse Gestapo unless they looked
like they had arrived to do some heavy cleaning.'' They knew Miriam
during the 1960s, when, as a civil rights activist in Mississippi,
she had an affair, and a child, with a Black professor named Eljay
Reese. Their daughter, Ronnee, was raised by her father (she was a
baby when Miriam last saw her) and is now 17. When Miriam sends her
a letter, it is a surprise that she answers, but not the last
surprise Ronnee will bring as she re-enters her mother's life.
Brown (''Tender Mercies,'' ``Before and After'') is a master at
rendering the tentative dynamics between mother and daughter, two
of the best women characters to come along in years. It's good
summer reading. Enjoy.

   ``ANGUS''
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Siebert
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $18.95)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but the dog lovers will fall for this one. Look at that
face. Look at that name. Angus was a Jack Russell terrier puppy,
and for just shy of 11months he lived with Siebert and his wife,
Bex. All but the epilogue of this ``memoir'' is narrated by Angus
himself, in a voice that is uncanny - not cute, not altogether
lovable, but terribly real and affecting. The story begins as Angus
lies dying after he is attacked by coyotes near a cabin where his
owners have sought refuge from city life. Siebert and Bex are
looking for him. Angus hears them calling, and as he waits for them
to find him, he contemplates the intense and sometimes rocky
association he has had with these people. What, exactly, is the
relationship between dogs and human beings? What did his people
want from him, and did he meet their needs? Angus is not sure, but
he looks at the questions with an intelligent and often alien
sensibility that makes for a moving (but never hokey) book. Angus
did well to inspire it in such a short lifetime.

   ``CRADLE AND ALL''
</P>
<P>
   By JAMES PATTERSON (Little, Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   In this rewrite of his long-out-of-print 1980 novel
``Virgin(beginitalic),'' (enditalic)Patterson has the world in a
religious frenzy over the mysterious pregnancies of two teenage
virgins, one in an Irish village, the other in Boston. One will
give birth to the child of God and one to the child of the devil,
but only Patterson knows who is chosen and who is cursed. His
heroine is Anne Fitzgerald, a strikingly attractive former nun (and
current virgin) who now makes her living as a private investigator
and is brought in by authorities to look into the immaculate
conceptions. Anne still loves the priest who propositioned her when
she was in the convent, and, don't you know, he shows up in the
middle of the virgin controversy to throw Anne into a romantic
tizzy. When they walk on the beach together, she knows they are a
handsome couple ``because several people passing us gave us a
sideways look.'' It's like that in this novel - when the action
isn't frenzied, it's dopey. A film version can't be far behind.

   ``APRONS: ICONS OF THE AMERICAN HOME''
</P>
<P>
   By Joyce Cheney
</P>
<P>
   (Running, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   There are women today who have never worn aprons, and we say
bully for them. Now, Cheney tells us that aprons are not just
icons. They are ``textiles,'' and they are collectible. Cheney
herself has 400. In 1994, she decided to ``express my own
understanding of aprons'' by creating a display on a clothesline in
New Mexico. People who saw them were smitten. They wanted to touch
them, to try them on. Children asked ``What are they?'' And so
Cheney organized an exhibit of aprons and wrote this book, which is
full of the real thing - aprons made of flour sacks or neckties,
aprons trimmed with rickrack, smocked aprons, embroidered aprons,
aprons with matching oven mitts. Granted, as aprons go, these
represent perfection - there's not a splotch of tomato sauce in
sight. Their effect is like that of those old pickup trucks you
also see in books: All polished and posed, they seem to smile at
you from the page. That, we suspect, has to do with the power of
memory, and bully for that, too.

LOS ALAMOS VICTIMS CLING TO FRIENDSHIP, PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BY  JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(GLORIETA, N.M.) - There wasn't much wearing of the Sunday best,
save for the pastor whose wife grabbed his suit in the hour she had
before the firefighters pulled them out of their home.
</P>
<P>
   There were shirtsleeves and wrinkles, dirt-spotted jeans and
soccer jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Three boxes of tissues sat on a card table at the back of the
chapel. By the end of the service, only one and half were used.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Cerro Grande wildfire burning around Los Alamos grew
to more than 40,000 acres and more than 1,000 firefighters fought
to keep it from further decimating the Santa Clara Pueblo
Reservation, people gathered to pray Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters tried to take advantage of the last day of good
weather forecast for a week, more than 250 people gathered in
Pojoaque Pueblo for a Catholic Mass while another 300 gathered at a
conference center in Glorieta.
</P>
<P>
   They sang and prayed and thanked God for pulling them through
and that no one was harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in a God who pushes cars together. I don't
believe in a God who says `This house will burn and that house
won't,'' said Doug Partin, pastor at the Los Alamos Christian
Church. ``I believe in a God who's a source of strength for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Prayer and song sessions have been held every night since Los
Alamos was evacuated and some of its former tenants took up
residence in a Baptist conference center's lodgings. Mostly, they
give the residents something to do, something to think about other
than their homes and what they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Davis' home wasn't burned, wasn't even close to the fire.
But she came out to Glorieta, anyway, to see whether she could find
some friends who had lost their home. And she had come there to
thank God for sparing her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can get back into our house, we plan to open it up to
people,'' she said. ``We have several rooms because the children
have all moved out. It's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were tears inside the conference center, a few hugs and a
loud, belted rendition of What a Friend We Have in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Children were summoned to the front of the chapel to pick up
flowers to give to their mothers, and it seemed as if every woman
above the age of 16 had a carnation for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson we should come away with here is about the
priorities in our lives,'' Partin said. ``The priorities in our
lives are not the creature comforts that we value so much. It's the
family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, though, there was a different mood. Frustration is
building among area residents, especially those from White Rock who
were evacuated early Thursday when officials thought the city was
in danger of burning down.
</P>
<P>
   The fire has stayed about three miles from the city, and
authorities say they think they can contain that edge of the fire
even as it continues to sweep across the Santa Clara Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of White Rock _ and Los Alamos _ had been told it
would probably be another 10 days before they are allowed to move
into their homes again. But White Rock residents learned late in
the day that they could return to their homes today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that we can't get in there,'' Rod
Christiansen of White Rock said. ``I've got a bunch of chickens and
turkeys and I've got a cousin on the police force and I asked him
to sneak in every once in a while to give them water so I wouldn't
have to dig too deep a grave when I get back. I've got a 45-pound
turkey. Can you imagine how deep I'd have to dig to bury him?''
</P>
<P>
   At the National Guard headquarters in Santa Fe, Los Alamos
residents who lost homes were allowed to get on school buses and
ride around the scorched sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Jalberg was not among them. Though he watched his quadplex
burn on television an hour after he evacuated it, he refused to get
on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some photos, some papers out, but that's it,'' he said.
``A few things for the kids. All our antiques, all our mementos
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it on flames on TV. What do I need to go back and see it
for?'' &QL;

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NEARS PEAK OF SLIMY CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pro basketball's answer to ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' was answered Sunday by 23 college underclassmen and
one high school kid, all of whom applied by the deadline for early
entry to the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was unfortunate, breaking as it did the hearts of 23
mothers on Mother's Day. Most were hoping for a college degree for
the son for whom they bought new clothes every two weeks during his
growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a 2000 Lexus will go a ways toward mending that
broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of these youngsters will have purchasing power,
such as Texas' 7-foot junior center, Chris Mihm, most of them
appear to have flunked classes in statistical probability.
</P>
<P>
   Since only 58 players will be chosen from a group of more than
1,000 letterman seniors at the Division I level, plus the
underclassmen, plus players from smaller schools, as well as the
rapidly improving pool of international players, the odds that most
of these early entrants will get an NBA sniff are smaller than
Bobby Knight's reservoir of humility.
</P>
<P>
   Moms, don't sell those '76 Country Squire station wagons yet.
</P>
<P>
   But as was mentioned here recently, many players will find the
odds of turning pro better than the odds of turning in a
self-written term paper (see the University of Minnesota under Clem
Haskins).
</P>
<P>
   Parallel with that trend is the penchant for unhappy players to
switch schools. Transfers that were once occasional in college ball
are now nearly epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The result is near-chaos for the big-time college game (see your
NCAA basketball tourney bracket).
</P>
<P>
   Few places have been as badly hurt by these trends as the
University of Washington. After losing two players early to the
pros (Patrick Femerling and Mark Sanford), the Huskies under coach
Bob Bender have been slugged by transfers. The latest was point
guard Senque Carey, the UW's best returning player, and the fifth
quality contributor to find another college instead of returning to
Bender.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons are numerous. One often overlooked is Bender's own
dalliances with a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' reappearance in the tournament in 1998 and 1999
made Bender a hot commodity for coaching vacancies. But after
high-profile, heavily chronicled negotiations with Texas and then
Vanderbilt, Bender returned each time to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was rewarded handsomely for his loyalty. Yet there was a
price.
</P>
<P>
   While it's hardly Bender's fault he became popular, his
wandering eye was not only dismaying to the players he brought to
Seattle, rival recruiters love the potential lack of stability, and
pound it into a bruise on the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is America, Bender is not only entitled to better
himself, the system encourages it. The athletes should be granted
the same rights, too.
</P>
<P>
   An NCAA scholarship is, after all, a contract renewable annually
and is not guaranteed for the four years of eligibility. That
one-way arrangement was abused heavily by Bender's predecessor,
Lynn Nance, whose spring run-offs of players became something of a
Husky tradition.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bender has not run off any players, even when he
could have used a scholarship for a more productive player. But
after his springtime flirtations with other schools, it would seem
neither a surprise nor a shame that his players get happy feet,
too.
</P>
<P>
   At least a job-switching coach isn't forced to sit out a year,
as is the punishment for Division I player transfers. Then again,
the NCAA has never been about being a democracy as much as it has
been about being a plantation.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a need to sort through the swarminess, here's a
thumbnail guide to the state of college ball:
</P>
<P>
   -- When a youth-ball street agent tells a high school kid,
``Man, these shoes and sweats look fine on you,'' he usually means:
Nike owns me. Nike's about to own you. And you're going to a
Nike-contract college.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a player says, ``I always wanted to be a
Husky/Cougar/Duck/Rutabaga/Fighting Bacteria,'' he usually means:
Unless I'm not getting at least 20 minutes a game by my sophomore
year.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a transferring player says, ``I'd rather play closer to
home,'' he usually means: I haven't seen my hometown girlfriend in
three weeks, and she just gave me an X-rated phone call.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a coach who stays put says, ``I just couldn't leave
these kids here,'' he usually means: Man, I can't believe they
coughed up the ski condo AND the lakefront home.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a grumbling player says, ``I'm not sure what coach wants
from me,'' he usually means: One more call from that Fresno State
assistant, and I'm outta here.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a player who declares for the draft says, ``I'm doing
this for my family,'' he usually means: Maybe all these freeloaders
will finally leave me alone.
</P>
<P>
   -- When a player's mother calls a coach and says, ``You're not
treating my boy right,'' she usually means: You're costing me a
four-bedroom split level, and you don't even want to think about me
catching up to your sorry behind.

TRAFFIC DEATH RAISES WORRIES ABOUT MEDICAL CONDITIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When state Department of Motor Vehicles officials
returned Carlton Davenport's suspended license, they took a risk
and his word that medication would stop his epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport told police he suffered a seizure March 27 at the
steering wheel of the vehicle that ran over and killed Christa
Irmhild Routhieaux as the 57-year-old walked in her San Fernando
Valley neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As police decide whether to seek criminal charges against
Davenport, his case opens a window on what some say is a need for
tighter rules for drivers who have experienced strokes &UR;  &LR; or who have
epilepsy, heart disease or other conditions that could cause them
to lose consciousness behind the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   DMV officials say Davenport is among 13,700 drivers whose
licenses are suspended or revoked each year for medical conditions
that could cause them to crash. No record is kept of how many of
those motorists win back their licenses and are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to watch these people a little closer,'' said Allen
M. Lawrence, a commercial insurance broker and a member of the
California Transportation Commission. ``I certainly have a grave
concern about innocent people being injured by drivers who don't
qualify to be on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said the DMV should pool information on these drivers
into a database for monitoring them and their ability to drive
safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew how many people there were, it could really help
focus some energy on this,'' Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Highway Patrol, fatal crashes caused
by seizures are so rare that statistics are not kept.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport defended the DMV's decision to return his license,
saying his seizure was unforeseeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was safe out there because of the medication,''
Davenport said. ``I just think everyone should have the opportunity
if you go through the right channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport told investigators he had not had a seizure in more
than a year before the fatal crash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   DMV officials contend they could have done nothing to prevent
the crash because there was no indication that Davenport's epilepsy
still posed a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we have some new information, we have to assume
everything is OK,'' said Jan Honey, chief of the DMV's driver
safety program. ``We (had) no recent evidence to give us any
particular concern about this driver.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there already were warning signs of trouble in
Davenport's driving.
</P>
<P>
   He was driving on a suspended license for failing to appear on
traffic citations that threatened a driving record already marred
by three crashes in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if epilepsy played no role in them, the three crashes
eventually would have come to DMV officials' attention and resulted
in Davenport's being deemed a negligent operator, Honey said. Such
drivers face sanctions ranging from just a warning to license
revocation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, a member of the Assembly
Transportation Committee, said DMV officials apparently did all
they could to monitor Davenport. He said he would like the DMV to
pay more attention to doctors who clear the way for risky patients
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to address the issue is to keep track of the
physicians who've given faulty opinions,'' McClintock said.
</P>
<P>
   The process is supposed to work like this: Doctors are required
under state law to notify county health authorities of Alzheimer's
disease, dementia or other conditions that cause a loss of
consciousness. In turn, health officials tell the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   A DMV hearing officer then interviews the individual, studies
the medical records and often administers a driving test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel the condition is such that it's extremely
dangerous, we may revoke their license, suspend it or place
restrictions,'' Honey said. ``If a doctor says the individual is
free of seizures for the past six months and the condition is very
well controlled by medication, there is no reason that person
should not have the opportunity to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, driving privileges are restored on condition the
driver periodically submit medical records, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What jeopardizes this system is any reluctance on the part of
the patient to be truthful with the doctor or the doctors' concern
that they are violating confidentiality by revealing patients' loss
of consciousness, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drives a wedge between doctors and their patients,'' said
San Diego doctor James S. Grisolia, an advisory board member of the
Epilepsy Foundation, a Maryland group that opposes requirements for
doctors to report to the state about their patients' private care.
</P>
<P>
   California is just one of six states where doctors are forced to
make such reports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medication can completely control seizures in about half of
epilepsy cases and, in Grisolia's opinion, public safety is not put
at risk by drivers with this condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to be safer than the overall motoring population,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seizures tend to occur when people are relaxed or a little
drowsy, so they tend to happen less often when people are behind
the wheel (where) they are alert and even annoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   What triggered Davenport's seizure is unclear, but the result
was that he lost control of his Ford Explorer. It jumped the curb
and hit Routhieaux, who was killed instantly. Police said Davenport
told them he suffered a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been stopped (before the crash), at least the
suspension would have been dealt with,'' said Los Angeles police
Detective Gary Pfeifle of the Valley Traffic Division. ``It would
have been up to the officer to arrest him or cite him or impound
his car. But that's a random, hit-or-miss proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the ultimate responsibility,'' Pfeifle said about
Davenport.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The growth and popularity of the WNBA can be tied directly to the
gold medal won by the U.S. women's basketball team at the 1996
Olympic Games in Atlanta.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gold-medal team provided an impetus for the first successful
women's professional league. Four years later, however, the WNBA
might be an obstacle for the Olympic team's defense of its gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season in the WNBA concludes Aug. 9. The last date
the title game could be played is Aug. 27. The Olympic team plans
to gather in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Aug. 14 and leave for
Australia on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will play its first Olympic game Sept. 16 vs. South
Korea, the first of five preliminary-round games in an eight-day
span.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 players who have been selected for the 2000 U.S. team,
10 will play in the WNBA, with only veteran Teresa Edwards sitting
out. Another player will be added to the Olympic team, with Sheryl
Swoopes of the Comets the apparent front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   A hectic summer? Without question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's going to be difficult,'' said 6-5 center Lisa
Leslie, the leading scorer on the 1996 Olympic team who now is with
the Los Angeles Sparks. ``It's something we've never dealt with
before. We're going to be asked to play our WNBA season and have an
eye on getting ready for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to really be aware of staying strong but not
getting fatigued. We're going to lift weights every other day, and
I'm sure at times we're not going to feel like doing that. But
that's part of what being in the Olympics this year is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie and Olympic teammates Edwards and DeLisha Milton were in
Houston on Sunday to take part in the Olympic Media Summit. U.S.
coach Nell Fortner believes the players will accept the challenge
of trying to maintain strength during the WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we've asked them to really focus on is to
maintain their weight program,'' Fortner said. ``An athlete can
decondition during a season if all they are doing is playing a
game, having a shootaround in the morning and playing another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot have that happen. They have a weight program that
they're being asked to do. Plus, if they aren't getting up and down
the floor a lot, we've asked they get on a treadmill or a bike and
put in some extra time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players are being asked to do more than anybody else in
the Olympics is being asked to do. But that's what it is to be an
Olympian this year. If you want that gold medal, then you'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who will turn 36 this summer and take part in her fifth
Olympics, is one player who won't have to be concerned about the
grind of the WNBA season. She has declined to sign with the league
since the American Basketball League folded in December 1998, but
she said she has hired a personal trainer who will push her to get
in top physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``My workouts are probably going to be harder than the girls who
are playing in the WNBA,'' Edwards said. ``My days are going to be
filled with two-a-days for the next three months.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time a U.S. women's basketball team will be
forced to juggle its schedule around a professional league. In
1996, the WNBA did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team started a pre-Olympic tour nearly 10 months before
the Atlanta Games. It played 52 games in seven countries and
traveled more than 100,000 miles. The U.S. went 59-0 in that tour
and swept to the gold medal with eight straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through that, but it was over a longer period of
time,'' Leslie said. ``Plus, we had the advantage of playing in our
country at the Olympics. This year, we're going to somebody else's
back yard. You know everybody's going to be gunning for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The main competition for the gold this year is expected to come
from Russia, Cuba, Brazil and host country Australia. The U.S. is
in the same bracket in the preliminary round with Russia and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in Australia's home court will be tough,'' Fortner
said. ``The parity in the women's game internationally is much
closer than in the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a lot of experienced players who are very
talented and some young players who can add a lot. We're going over
there with our guns loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But will their tanks will be full?

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF the WNBA is the best women's basketball league in the world, it
stands to reason that the thrice-defending champion Comets are the
best team in the world not created from an entire nation's talent
pool.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems strange that the Comets, who could be four-time
defending champions when the Olympics begin, may not be represented
on the U.S. Olympic team in Sydney in September. They were
conspicuous by their absence from the news-conference dais at the
Olympic Summit on Sunday, although their being in Washington to
play an exhibition game would have precluded their presence
regardless of their Olympic status.
</P>
<P>
   Which, at present, is nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper is gone, having left the team last fall for
personal reasons, and Tina Thompson, although technically still
under consideration, figures to fall victim to the numbers game at
her position. I say may, however, because Sheryl Swoopes, albeit
apparently somewhat to her own amazement, remains one of a number
of candidates for the still-vacant 12th spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me a packet in the mail last week,'' Swoopes said.
``I wasn't expecting it, because I sort of felt like I was out of
the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   No. Coach Nell Fortner, in town for the Olympic Summit over the
weekend, confirmed Sunday that Swoopes was very much in the
picture. But Fortner also seemed to be saying that Sheryl will have
to earn the spot and must be further ``evaluated'' based on how she
performs over the coming WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, that might seem fair enough. Except Swoopes is
Swoopes, about the closest thing the women's game had to a Michael
Jordan when it emerged from relative obscurity in the mid-1990s to
actually become a marketable commodity in the U.S. And her best
years may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   You make stars like Sheryl, the top vote-getter for last
season's WNBA All-Star Game, the centerpiece of your program. You
bend over backward to accommodate special talents such as hers. You
don't make her jump through hoops to shoot hoops for the
motherland. It's not like she didn't want to be part of the
national team over the WNBA's offseason. In good conscience, she
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The sole reason Swoopes isn't a slam dunk to be representing the
U.S. in Sydney is because personal circumstances _ the residue of a
difficult divorce and the demands on a suddenly single mom with a
2-year-old _ made it impossible for her to join the team for its
training sessions and subsequent globe-trotting.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, a '96 Olympian, hasn't played with the national team
since the winter of 1999. When she begged off most recently, she
found herself off the ``A'' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't afford to just leave (son) Jordan for two months
while I left to play basketball,'' she said. ``I wasn't in a place
where I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Swoopes professes to possess no hard feelings about not
being given preferential consideration, her stature is such that
she should be catered to, particularly under her trying
circumstances. But, says Fortner: ``I find it hard to believe you
would have to talk somebody into playing on the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Except Swoopes doesn't need to be persuaded. She only needs to
be asked. Not in August, either. Now. It's beneath her to have to
audition. They wouldn't make Michael do it, would they?
</P>
<P>
   Coop's case is different, yet similar. Twice the WNBA's Most
Valuable Player some 10 years after she helped bring home the 1988
gold medal from Seoul, she politely excused herself from the
national team the moment the Comets completed their three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   She was seeking some much-needed time and space to, as she said,
``go through the grieving process'' after the deaths of her mother
and teammate Kim Perrot. A better tack with Cooper perhaps would
have been to give her as much of both as she needed while saving
her spot, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No hard feelings,'' Coop said. ``I've got (a gold medal). I'm
pulling for the team to get another.''
</P>
<P>
   And we must assume they will, Comets or no Comets in the mix.
But at least one Olympian admitted she would feel more secure if
Houston's WNBA dynasty were certain to be represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person that really comes to mind, that I really wish
was on our team, is Sheryl,'' said Lisa Leslie of the rival Los
Angeles Sparks. ``I feel we do need her.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Leslie isn't lobbying for Swoopes because
they're best girlfriends. She's simply being pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's not about chemistry,'' the Sparks' brightest
spark said. ``It's about what a player can bring to the court and
what our team needs. At this point, I feel Sheryl could really help
us. She's very versatile, and she plays great defense. Defense will
enable us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Comet, Swoopes knows plenty about winning.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Considering the rarity of the occurrence so far this season, any
win is a big win for the Astros. And while their latest was worth
only one game in the standings, it carried major weight in the home
clubhouse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros snapped a two-game losing streak with a 10-3 victory
over the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday night before a sellout crowd at
Enron Field and a national ESPN audience.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that was as much a battle as it was a war, the Astros
won on both counts. Scott Elarton pitched seven solid innings and
likely earned an immeasurable amount of respect for a pitch that
hit Ken Griffey Jr. in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, Reds starter Steve Parris hit Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell in the left thigh before umpire crew chief
Alan Clark issued warnings to both benches.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, both pitches were thrown with a purpose, considering
some bad blood that developed in Saturday's game when both clubs
felt the other engaged in some unnecessary showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the game is played,'' Bagwell said. ``That's as far
as I'll go with that. Anyone who knows anything about how the game
is played knows what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won for only the fourth time in their last nine
games. They had lost 11 of their last 15 games against the Reds,
dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was character-check time,'' said Astros shortstop Bill
Spiers, who was 3-for-4. ``Not to make it sound drastic, but we
needed a win. Actually, we need a bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can consistently duplicate Sunday's performance, the
victories would start coming with more frequency. The pitching
staff held the Reds to three runs and six hits, while the offense
churned out 10 runs and 13 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep winning if we play good defense, pitch and hit _
all the things we haven't done at the same time for most of the
year,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton held the Reds to two runs on four hits in seven innings,
and Bagwell and catcher Mitch Meluskey paced the offense with three
RBIs apiece. The bullpen, which blew leads each of the previous two
days, held off the Reds to secure Elarton's second victory and his
first at Enron Field. Elarton and Shane Reynolds are the only
Astros pitchers to win a game at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, this is a big win,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``They beat us a lot last year, and they beat us the
first two games of this series. They kind of had us on our heels.''
</P>
<P>
   A psychological victory also could be claimed, considering the
way the Astros' starting pitchers have performed on the current
homestand. They have compiled a 3.95 ERA in the six games, and that
number drops to 2.62 if you exclude Elarton's seven-run,
four-inning outing against the Rockies in his previous start.
Perhaps as impressive is the fact they've allowed only four homers
in 38 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone in the rotation has had a good outing here except
(Jose) Lima, and we hope he has one (tonight),'' Dierker said. ``I
think we've gotten past the psychological barriers of pitching in
this ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton allowed both of his runs in the first inning on Dante
Bichette's single up the middle. The Reds managed to advance only
two runners into scoring position against Elarton after the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look too good after the first inning, but he settled
down,'' Dierker said. ``To put six zeros on the board against that
club and in this ballpark is tough to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the score in the second on a single by Spiers
and a double-play grounder off the bat of Roger Cedeno, who brought
home Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey's three-run homer gave the Astros a 5-2 lead in the
fifth. He is hitting .444 (12-for-27) with two homers and nine RBIs
in his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's RBI double pushed the Astros' lead to four runs in the
sixth. The two-out hit was timely in more ways than one for
Bagwell, who had only two hits in his previous 23 at-bats. Bagwell,
who was 2-for-3 with three RBIs, is hitting .239 in his last 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better,'' Bagwell said. ``It's a good sign for me to
hit a ball to right field. Sometimes in baseball you can know what
you're doing wrong and not know how to fix it. It's easy to say and
hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added another run in the eighth when catcher Eddie
Taubensee led off with an infield single and scored on Juan
Castro's triple into the left-field gap off righthanded reliever
Joe Slusarski. Jose Cabrera worked the ninth inning to close out
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored four runs (two earned) off Manny Aybar in the
bottom of the eighth, giving Cabrera some breathing room. Bagwell
had a two-run single in the inning, and Moises Alou _ activated
from the disabled list less than two hours before the game _ also
drove in a run in the inning with a double into the left-field gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice to see, because in this park you have to keep
putting runs up there,'' Spiers said. ``You never know what's going
to happen here.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Why did Jason Kapono even bother putting on a UCLA
tank top for one season if he knew he'd be trying the NBA's
patience less than a year after his high school graduation?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he thought Steve Lavin really had somethin' going.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin does. It's college basketball's version of skydiving.
He'll pilot the plane up a few thousand feet, then hand out
parachutes. One per customer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of yelling ``Geronimo,'' it's ``Kapono, wait for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is those who !ital!don't jump look like they're
scared. Wazza matter, Earl Watson? Are ya yellow?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing scary about this whole rip-cord mentality is that
there isn't any way to stop it, locally or nationally. It's the
NCAA epidemic, and its hands are tied.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds stupid, but there's gonna be a day when a junior high
kid calls his own news conference at the school cafeteria after
recess and, with his P.E. teacher/agent standing behind him, tells
the world he's ready to join the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA will welcome him to the party. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Bully for Bob Knight. The weekend's over and he hasn't been
forced into any anger management counseling. ...
</P>
<P>
   --As talented as Allen Iverson is, he doesn't make his team
better. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Who are the Dodgers trying to fool with those billboards?
That's someone's drawing of Raul Mondesi leaping for a ball at the
wall. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Going into the weekend, the D'backs' magic number was 124 to
tie and 125 to clinch the West outright. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Check the early warning signs of the Dodgers' bullpen woes: On
this day in 1919, the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds went 12
scoreless innings. Then Al Mamaux came in and gave up 10 runs to
the Reds in the 13th. ...
</P>
<P>
   --There's a chance that some ex-big-leaguers will be picked for
the Olympic baseball team. So, yup, Orel Hershiser could be joining
Tom Lasorda down under by the time August rolls around. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The ball Pete Rose purportedly hit for his 4,000th career base
knock goes on auction this week. Pete's betting it's the real deal.
...
</P>
<P>
   --Celebrity sighting: Eric Dickerson, Deacon Jones, Sugar Ray
Leonard, John Robinson and Charles White are scheduled to attend an
open-to-the-public gathering at Yankee Doodles in Santa Monica on
Thursday from 6 to 8:30 p.m., promoting ESPN Classic's programming
lineup of great moments in L.A. sports history that'll air Saturday
and Sunday. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The best current pro athlete with the best golf handicap is,
according to Golf Digest, Arena Football League quarterback Peter
Tom Willis of the Tampa Bay Storm. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Given the chance to own a team in any pro sport, John Elway
knows one he'll never go after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't touch baseball if they gave it to me,'' he told the
Rocky Mountain News. ``They have no (salary) cap and the players
run that whole deal.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   --Don King says the recent Lennox Lewis-Michael Grant fight was
so bad, people were calling his office to get a refund - and it
wasn't even his fight.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a natural assumption, though. ...
</P>
<P>
   --That four-team Spring Football League that started a few
Saturdays ago with a game between the Los Angeles Dragons and some
team from Houston that drew about 200 at the Coliseum? It's already
suspended operations.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dragons, who included kicker Chris Sailor, go down 0-1.
Meaning, combined with the Avengers' 0-5 record, L.A. isn't missing
out on any pro football.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 14, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   PEACEKEEPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Call it Democratic Man's Burden.
He watches TV news. He sees a child starving in Somalia,
eviscerated by shrapnel in Sarajevo or maimed by rebels in Sierra
Leone. He feels morally affronted, angry and a little guilty. He
demands Something Be Done. So it begins _ the peacekeeping
imperative. From Haiti to East Timor, Angola to Iraq, the Western
democracies _ and especially the United States, with its news media
as its tireless, outrage-sniffing hound _ have claimed a stake in
almost every fight, especially those that produce television
pictures of pitiless tyrants harming innocents. By Blaine Harden.
(Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Call it the infantilization
of politics. Ever since President Clinton won re-election four
years ago with child-centered issues like school uniforms and
literacy and stopping teen-age smoking, candidates have
increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role of
Santa Claus. But it was Clinton who built a whole presidential
campaign around kids, telegraphing his empathy for working parents
by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into a
school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded
tykes. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Until fairly recently,
American voters punished candidates who made them aware of their
personal complications. The presidential prospects of Nelson
Rockefeller and Adlai Stevenson, it is said, were hurt by their
divorces. Eventually divorce became politically acceptable, but
adultery was still a no-no. Now, as William Bennett points out, not
only is adultery no longer politically fatal for candidates, but
even such ``complicating factors'' as lying to the public about an
affair, or carrying on with an underling, seem to matter less and
less. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   GENES-PATENTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In December, an obscure agency
known as the European Patent Office erroneously issued the first
patent to allow the cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, it
may have granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup
of the entire human species. This case of ``Brave New World'' meets
the Marx Brothers will not be untangled soon. The appeals process
for overturning the patent is sure to take years. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Playwright Michael
Frayn's `'Copenhagen'' arrived on Broadway last month after a
critical and commercial success in London. The three-character play
about the unsettling philosophical implications of quantum physics
is a hit here, too. Ben Brantley, theater critic of The New York
Times, called it ``the most invigorating and ingenious play of
ideas in many a year.'' But does anyone understand it? By Rick
Marin.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-COSTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It now costs about $160,140 to
raise a middle-class child through age 17, according to a
government report. That's up from $25,229 in 1960 ($69,333 in
1980), seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted
for inflation, would equal $141,998 today, so the cost of bringing
up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960. By Tamar Lewin.
With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL-HERO-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Basketball Hall of Fame
is considering the induction of a long-forgotten Italian immigrant
bowling-alley owner from Syracuse, N.Y., Danny Biasone, who back in
the mid-1950s literally saved the game at a time when the future of
the young NBA was in doubt. By Charles Paikert.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-BISHOPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The selection of Edward Egan
as archbishop of New York is illustrative of the appointments made
by Pope John Paul II. The pontiff has reshaped the American church
hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled
vacancies with men who share his own vision of how the church
should be run. The process has been gradual, but its effect has
been profound. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   DOOMSDAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Let's face it: Y2K was a bust. Now
with the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a
millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may
come May 17, when the Sun and five planets will form an unusually
tight alignment. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   PHILOSOPHERS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The writer Paul Strathern,
who earned a philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, has
been distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90
minutes. A godsend in this era of the short attention span, the
series begins with ``Socrates in 90 Minutes,'' wittily compressing
his life and works, and proceeds to Locke, Augustine, Descartes,
Sarte and others. Excerpts from the books.
</P>
<P>
   CONTROLLED-CATASTROPHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In the wake of the
Los Alamos wildfire, some imaginary deliberate disasters are
reported.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Across Africa, there have been
countless incidents of quack AIDS cures being sold, some even
supported by government officials. But South African President
Thabo Mbeki is the only leader to have questioned the mainstream
theories on what causes AIDS. AIDS activists, long annoyed by South
Africa's inaction, are now shocked by the attention the issue is
getting. But Mbeki's refusal to accept standard scientific thinking
remains puzzling to almost everyone. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-REBELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Colombian government,
frustrated by its inability to end thirty years of war against two
major guerrilla movements, is now seeking peace by granting both
guerrilla movements the one thing they want most: uncontested zones
that they can call their own territory. The government has in
effect formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full
sovereignty over all its territory, leaving the two zones a kind of
neverland where it is not clear who is in charge _ or how the zones
fit into the rest of the country. By Larry Rohter. With graphic.

<P>
   &UR; THE NIGHT INSPECTOR &LR;  By Frederick Busch. Ballantine, $14. A
former Union sniper, wearing a mask to conceal a wound sustained in
the Civil War, wanders the streets of New York, where he becomes a
friend of a forgotten writer who resembles Melville. This novel
``is a marvelously dark-hued story by a master craftsman,'' John
Crowley wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999. ``His
prose and his conversations are precisely, surprisingly and
thoroughly of their time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRYPTONOMICON &LR;  By Neal Stephenson. HarperPerennial, $16. This
overstuffed picaresque novel is an audaciously conceived tale of
code making and code breaking. It takes place both during World War
II, when the Allies were scrambling to break the Nazis' Enigma
code, and in the present day, when a couple of entrepreneurial
computer hackers are trying to create a ``data haven'' for
encrypted information in the Philippines. With its profusion of
plot lines, characters and gonzo riffs, the book is ``as
fascinating, and as frustrating, as a string of partly decrypted
code,'' Dwight Garner wrote last year. ``It wants to blow your mind
while keeping you well fed and happy. ... It's brain candy for
bitheads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GOOD MAN OF NANKING: The Diaries of John Rabe &LR;  Edited by
Erwin Wickert. Vintage, $14. The author, a German businessman and
Nazi supporter, not only witnessed the Japanese massacre in Nanking
in 1937 but also saved the lives of many poor Chinese. His
unpolemical account ``is at once riveting, inspiring, terrifying
and tragically sad,'' Sheryl WuDunn wrote in 1998. It is
``compassionate and, at times, humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEXTANTS OF BEIJING: Global Currents in Chinese History &LR; ,
by Joanna Waley-Cohen (Norton, $14.95), surveys the history of
China's ambivalent relations with the outside world and seeks to
shatter the myth that the nation traditionally has been deeply
isolationist. Last year the reviewer Nicholas D. Kristof disagreed
with much of the thesis but found this to be a ``thoughtful and
highly readable'' book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BROADWAY BABIES SAY GOODNIGHT: Musicals Then and Now &LR;  By Mark
Steyn. Routledge, $17. A columnist and critic offers an irreverent
history of the Broadway musical, a diverse and lively art form
that, judging from the flood of revivals these days, may be in its
death throes. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Robert
Gottlieb called this an ``eccentric, funny, shrewd and somewhat
dismaying book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PALACE &LR;  By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. Ecco/HarperCollins,
$13. The narrator of this exotic fairy tale is a former political
prisoner who assumes a gentleman's guise, makes a fortune as a
gambler in 19th-century Venice and builds a dream house for the
woman he loves. Last year the reviewer David Willis McCullough
admired the novel's ``lovingly rendered descriptive prose'' and its
``sensuous and sinuous portrait of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHADOW: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate &LR;  By Bob
Woodward. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16. The celebrated
investigative journalist examines how the rules of presidential
politics have changed since the Nixon administration, dwelling in
depth on the Clinton White House and its efforts to manage the
Whitewater, Lewinsky and other scandals. ``Some of Woodward's
judgments are shrewd and plausible,'' Michael Lind wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIMBUKTU &LR;  By Paul Auster. Picador USA, $11. Mr. Bones, this
novel's canine protagonist, roams urban, suburban and rural America
looking for a home (and spiritual enlightenment) after the death of
his beloved longtime companion, a homeless man from Brooklyn. Last
year the reviewer Jim Shepard praised the tale's ``periodic flashes
of gorgeous prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DISOWNED BY MEMORY: Wordsworth's Poetry of the 1790s &LR;  By David
Bromwich. University of Chicago, $15. The author explores the
crucial years of the poet's moral development, when his republican
ardor was transformed by the Terror that followed the French
Revolution. ``Bromwich is a rigorous critic, but he is a general
one whose insights are broadly applicable,'' Vijay Seshadri wrote
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE PLEASURES OF THE
IMAGINATION: English Culture in the Eighteenth Century &LR; , by John
Brewer ($20), a grand tour of the world of fine arts and literature
during a time when culture moved from the court into the public
domain, to be possessed as well as consumed. ``Brewer gives us a
brilliantly illustrated social history of the many people who
produced plays and paintings, music and books,'' T.H. Breen wrote
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I LEFT MY BACK DOOR OPEN &LR;  By April Sinclair. HarperPerennial,
$13. Daphne Dupree is a Chicago radio host with lots to say about
race, weight, self-esteem and popular music. ``It's a `Bridget
Jones' Diary' for black women,'' Sarah Vowell wrote last year.
``Many readers will respond to this novel's honesty'' and
``colloquial humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GARDENS IN THE DUNES &LR;  By Leslie Marmon Silko. Scribner, $14.
Set in the 19th century, this novel follows the fate of two
American Indian girls who are sent from their desert home to
government-run schools to become ``civilized.'' The result is ``a
rich, intriguing, irritating mix of myth, allegory, Victorian
children's tale and adventure yarn,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote in 1999.

   ``But Heisenberg, Heisenberg! You also have been deflected! If
people can see what's happened to you, to their piece of light,
then they can work out what must have happened to me! The trouble
is knowing what's happened to you! Because to understand how people
see you we have to treat you not just as a particle, but as a wave.
I have to use not only your particle mechanics, I have to use the
Schroedinger wave function.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Frayn's play ``Copenhagen'' arrived on
Broadway last month, a three-character drama about the
philosophical implications of quantum physics that Ben Brantley,
chief theater critic for The New York Times, called ``the most
invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year.'' But does
anyone understand it?
</P>
<P>
   Frayn imagines the conversations that might have taken place
between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, on a night
in 1941 when the two scientists men met in German-occupied
Copenhagen. Bohr had developed the ``old quantum theory'' of atomic
matter; Heisenberg announced the famous uncertainty principle in
1927. These and 22 other dates and theorems are in a timeline
(written by Frayn) contained in a Playbill foldout. Sample entry:
``THE WAVE EQUATION. 1926 Schroedinger finds the mathematical
equation for the wave interpretation, and proves that wave and
matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Not since Tom Stoppard threw together James Joyce, Lenin
and Tristan Tzara in ``Travesties'' in 1975 have audience brows
been lifted quite so high.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn uses the Bohr-Heisenberg meeting, and the uncertainty
principle, to show the unknowability of all things. But what  &UR; is &LR; 
the uncertainty principle?
</P>
<P>
   We put that question to some members of the audience at a
performance of ``Copenhagen'' and to several people involved with
the production, as well as one genuine scientist. No Cliff Notes
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Grisiatis, freelance press agent: ``Oh, jeez. You're
talking to the wrong person.'' Grisiatis looked in panic at his
companion outside the Royale Theater during intermission at
Wednesday's matinee. Nonetheless, he bravely advanced a definition.
``You can never predict. You can only take an educated guess on
certain things. Is that about right? Science was never my strong
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Hodges, creative director: ``I understand what he's telling
me to understand, but I don't understand how a particle can be a
wave and a particle.'' Hodges works at SPOTco, the design studio
that produced the Playbill timeline. He recalled Jeff Goldblum in
the movie ``The Lost World,'' saying that the uncertainty principle
meant something like, ``You can't study a thing without changing
it.'' He said: ``It's like on Broadway there'll be someone someone
hates and someone someone loves, depending on your experience of
that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vanarendonk, retired United Nations official: ``You
cannot identify a particle at the same time,'' he said, drawing
thoughtfully on a pipe at Wednesday's matinee. ``In other words,
the movement, if you want to freeze it in time, then it is a
particle. But, if you want to understand. . . . Let me put it this
way. . . . It's quite difficult to conceptualize. You can identify
you by placing you in time and place. The particle you cannot put
at the same time in the same time and place. And that is the
uncertain_'' he cut himself off.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous audience member: ``I'm very distracted by all the
noise here on the street,'' she said, struggling to explain
uncertainty. ``I don't understand it, no. Are you recording this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bosco, who plays Bohr: ``There is nothing explainable in
the universe at the deepest level of science,'' he said. ``In the
quantum mechanics and the nuclear physics that we're talking about,
whatever you observe changes the nature of what you're observing.''
Bosco, let it be noted, confessed to some initial skepticism about
the play's appeal and difficulties memorizing his more technical
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cumpsty, who plays Heisenberg: ``I would say it means
you can't know the location and velocity of a particle at the same
time, or, to extrapolate, in its theoretical form, as Heisenberg
says in the play, of anything,'' he said. ``If you want to
understand the physics you're going to have to go off and read a
book,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Greene, author of ``The Elegant Universe'' and a professor
of physics and mathematics at Columbia University: ``As developed
in 1927 by Heisenberg, it tells us there's a fundamental limitation
about and on what we can possibly know about the microscopic realm
_ where something is and how fast something is moving,'' he said.
``We can't know both of these things with absolute precision.'' As
for Frayn's science, ``It looked good to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Frayn, playwright: While the play was in previews in New
York he received a letter from a confused audience member who wrote
that ``She couldn't understand a word of the science and if I
didn't remove it, the play wouldn't last long on Broadway,'' he
said.

in 1941 when the two scientists men met in German-occupied
Copenhagen. Bohr had developed the ``old quantum theory'' of atomic
matter; Heisenberg announced the famous uncertainty principle in
1927. These and 22 other dates and theorems are in a timeline
(written by Frayn) contained in a Playbill foldout. Sample entry:
``THE WAVE EQUATION. 1926 Schroedinger finds the mathematical
equation for the wave interpretation, and proves that wave and
matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Not since Tom Stoppard threw together James Joyce, Lenin
and Tristan Tzara in ``Travesties'' in 1975 have audience brows
been lifted quite so high.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn uses the Bohr-Heisenberg meeting, and the uncertainty
principle, to show the unknowability of all things. But what  &UR; is &LR; 
the uncertainty principle?
</P>
<P>
   We put that question to some members of the audience at a
performance of ``Copenhagen'' and to several people involved with
the production, as well as one genuine scientist. No Cliff Notes
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Grisiatis, freelance press agent: ``Oh, jeez. You're
talking to the wrong person.'' Grisiatis looked in panic at his
companion outside the Royale Theater during intermission at
Wednesday's matinee. Nonetheless, he bravely advanced a definition.
``You can never predict. You can only take an educated guess on
certain things. Is that about right? Science was never my strong
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Hodges, creative director: ``I understand what he's telling
me to understand, but I don't understand how a particle can be a
wave and a particle.'' Hodges works at SPOTco, the design studio
that produced the Playbill timeline. He recalled Jeff Goldblum in
the movie ``The Lost World,'' saying that the uncertainty principle
meant something like, ``You can't study a thing without changing
it.'' He said: ``It's like on Broadway there'll be someone someone
hates and someone someone loves, depending on your experience of
that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vanarendonk, retired United Nations official: ``You
cannot identify a particle at the same time,'' he said, drawing
thoughtfully on a pipe at Wednesday's matinee. ``In other words,
the movement, if you want to freeze it in time, then it is a
particle. But, if you want to understand. . . . Let me put it this
way. . . . It's quite difficult to conceptualize. You can identify
you by placing you in time and place. The particle you cannot put
at the same time in the same time and place. And that is the
uncertain_'' he cut himself off.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous audience member: ``I'm very distracted by all the
noise here on the street,'' she said, struggling to explain
uncertainty. ``I don't understand it, no. Are you recording this?''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bosco, who plays Bohr: ``There is nothing explainable in
the universe at the deepest level of science,'' he said. ``In the
quantum mechanics and the nuclear physics that we're talking about,
whatever you observe changes the nature of what you're observing.''
Bosco, let it be noted, confessed to some initial skepticism about
the play's appeal and difficulties memorizing his more technical
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cumpsty, who plays Heisenberg: ``I would say it means
you can't know the location and velocity of a particle at the same
time, or, to extrapolate, in its theoretical form, as Heisenberg
says in the play, of anything,'' he said. ``If you want to
understand the physics you're going to have to go off and read a
book,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Greene, author of ``The Elegant Universe'' and a professor
of physics and mathematics at Columbia University: ``As developed
in 1927 by Heisenberg, it tells us there's a fundamental limitation
about and on what we can possibly know about the microscopic realm
_ where something is and how fast something is moving,'' he said.
``We can't know both of these things with absolute precision.'' As
for Frayn's science, ``It looked good to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Frayn, playwright: While the play was in previews in New
York he received a letter from a confused audience member who wrote
that ``She couldn't understand a word of the science and if I
didn't remove it, the play wouldn't last long on Broadway,'' he
said.

   College may be the last official stop for mulling over life's
eternal questions. You know: Who am I? Where am I? And, of course,
what is the meaning of life? Then again, maybe not.

<P>
   Philosophy, the discipline for students intent on becoming
philosophers until their parents ask how much it pays, is now
within reach and available without the deep pain of tuition. For
the past few years, the writer Paul Strathern, who earned his own
philosophy degree at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, has been
distilling most of the world's best-known philosophers to 90
minutes, which, he said, is the length of a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   A godsend in this era of the short attention span, his series,
published by Ivan R. Dee, begins with ``Socrates in 90 Minutes,''
wittily compressing his life and works, and proceeds to Locke, St.
Augustine, Descartes and Sartre, among others. New books on George
Berkeley and Paul-Michel Foucault are scheduled to be published
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Strathern wanted to write about the philosophers' lives, he
said, adding in a few of their ideas. ``If you fix it that way,
people do get it,'' he said. ``It gets to them, like garlic: It
sticks to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this breathless age of day-trading, online banking,
gym for lunch and the New York minute, who has 90 minutes? Let's
whittle this philosophy thing down to 90 seconds. Excerpts from the

   Socrates developed a method of negatively aggressive questioning
called dialectic (the forerunner of logic). This he used in
conversation to cut through the twaddle of his adversaries and
arrive at the truth. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Socrates went on to study under the philosopher Archelaus, ``by
whom he was beloved in the worse sense.'' . . . It wasn't long
before Socrates had demonstrated to his own satisfaction that the
so-called wise men of Athens in fact knew nothing _ just like him.
So he concluded that the Delphic Oracle had been right: He  &UR; was &LR; 
the wisest man _ because he  &UR; knew &LR;  that he knew nothing. . . . One
of his best-remembered remarks is, ``The unexamined life is not
worth living.''

<P>
   Plato explains that most human beings live as if in a dim cave .
. . In more philosophical terms, Plato believed that everything we
perceive around us _ the shoes and ships and sealing wax, and
cabbages and kings, of everyday experience _ is merely appearance.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   In Plato's ideal republic, there would be no possessions or
marriage (except among the lower orders, who were presumably the
only people fit for such things). Children would be removed from
their mothers soon after birth and educated communally. In this way
they would come to regard the state as their parents. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In Plato, eros is regarded as the soul's impulse toward good. In
its lowest form this is expressed in our passion for a beautiful
person and our wish for immortality by producing offspring with
that person. . . .

   Where Plato's approach to the world was essentially religious,
Aristotle's tended toward the scientific. This made him disinclined
to dismiss the world around us as unreal. . . . Aristotle's most
significant achievement was in the field of logic. To all intents
he invented this subject. Aristotle came to see logic as the
foundation on which all learning was based. . . For example, if we
make the following two statements: All humans are mortal. All
Greeks are human. It can be inferred that: All Greeks are mortal. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle called his logic ``analytika,'' which means
unraveling. Every science or field of knowledge had to start from a
set of first principles, or axioms. From these its truths could be
deduced by logic (or unraveled).

</P>
<P>
   Confucius is the Latinized form of Kungfutzu (which means ``the
master Kung''). . . . Late in life, Confucius was to remember:
``When I was 15 I was only interested in studying.'' This was the
bedrock of his life, which he would later see as having been
divided into distinct stages: ``When I was 30 I began my life; at
40 I was self-assured; at 50 I understood my place in the vast
scheme of things; at 60 I learned to give up arguing; and now at 70
I can do whatever I like without disrupting my life.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Confucius was essentially a moral teacher. He was always sincere
and distrusted eloquence. . . . The key element of Confucius'
teachings was symbolized by the Chinese character  &UR; jen. &LR;  This stood
for a conceptual blend of magnanimity, virtue, and love of
humanity.

   Machiavelli was not an evil man. And . . . his political
philosophy was not evil  &UR; in itself. &LR;  It was just extremely
realistic. . . . ((From the chapter, ``For Those Who Seize Power by
Crime,'' from  &UR; The Prince &LR; )) ``Cruelties inflicted immediately to
secure one's position are well inflicted (if one may speak well of
ill).'' Note this last proviso: Machiavelli still considered
himself moral, even if his advice was not. . . Machiavelli's book
is advice to a prince on how to run a state. It is not a guide to
personal morality. It is aimed at a rare class of people in
specific circumstances. . . Bertrand Russell was absolutely right
when he called  &UR; The Prince &LR;  ``a handbook for gangsters.'' Mafia

   Descartes retained a deep ambivalence toward his education. It
seemed to him to be largely rubbish: rehashed Aristotle encrusted
with centuries of interpretations; the stifling theology of Aquinas
which had answers for everything but answered nothing; a morass of
metaphysics. . . . One day while sitting in his stove, Descartes
had a vision. It's not clear precisely what he saw under these
rather steamed-up circumstances, but it seems that this vision
contained a mathematical picture of the world. . . . No matter how
deluded I may be in my thoughts about myself and the world, there
is just one thing that is undeniable: I am thinking. This alone
proves to me my existence. In the most famous remark in philosophy,
Descartes concludes: ``Cogito ergo sum'' (I think, therefore I am).

   With John Locke philosophy enters its flat-earth period. Great
ideas are often obvious. None more so than those of John Locke.
Much of his thought we would now regard as common sense. His
philosophy was to lay the foundations of empiricism, with its
belief that our knowledge of the world is based on experience. It
also introduced the idea of liberal democracy, which has become the
shibboleth of Western civilization. . . . This all makes Locke's
philosophy rather uninteresting.

   ``The height of audacity in serving up pure nonsense, in
stringing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words, such
as had previously only been known in madhouses, was finally reached
in Hegel, and became the instrument of the most barefaced general
mystification that has ever taken place, with a result which will
appear fabulous to posterity, and will remain as a monument to
German stupidity.'' So wrote Schopenhauer, who was Hegel's
colleague at the University of Berlin. This remark is not intended
to prejudice but merely to warn. With Hegel, philosophy becomes a
matter of  &UR; extreme seriousness &LR; , so we'd best get any jokes out of

   With Nietzsche philosophy becomes dangerous again, this time

dangerous for philosophers; with Nietzsche it becomes dangerous for
everyone. Nietzsche ended up by going mad. . . . Nietzsche's larger
philosophical ideas are barely worthy of the name _ whether he's
talking about supermen, eternal recurrence (the idea that we live
our lives again and again throughout eternity), or the sole purpose
of civilization (to produce ``great men'' such as Goethe, Napoleon
and himself).

   They say necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation
can also be its source. In Colombia, a government frustrated by its
inability to end three decades of warfare with two major guerrilla
insurgencies is now seeking peace by granting both movements one of
the things they crave most: uncontested territory they can call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not without logic, though its many critics contend
that the logic is deeply flawed. The idea was that pulling troops
out of what were already rebel strongholds could create an
atmosphere of good will in peace talks. But that hasn't really
happened so far, and so the effect has been somewhat different:
Colombia has formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full
sovereignty over all its territory.
</P>
<P>
   That has left the two zones a kind of never-never land where it
is not clear who is in charge or how the zones fit into the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing, in a sense, the hollowing-out of government in
critical regions of Latin America and its replacement by
individuals who are, in fact, introducing a narco-government, a
small narco-empire,'' said Peter Romero, the State Department's
senior official for Latin American affairs, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of these two insurgent-controlled areas began 18
months ago, when the government ceded 16,000 square miles to
Colombia's largest guerrilla group, known as the FARC, in an effort
to jump-start peace talks. But the talks have faltered, and the
FARC has only become more powerful. It acts increasingly like a
parallel government and is now planning a ``peace tax'' on wealthy
people and companies in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move also left Colombia's other big rebel
group, known as the ELN, intensely jealous. So the group began a
sabotage and kidnapping campaign, to which President Andres
Pastrana responded last month by agreeing to concede it a second
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America has had its share of insurgencies, but even at the
height of the Central American civil wars of the 1980s there was
never an arrangement quite like this. Guerrillas exercised de facto
control of parts of El Salvador and Contras ranged freely over
northern Nicaragua, but they certainly did not do so with the
consent of the governments they were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concession has not gone over well with ordinary
Colombians, especially those who must live in the area that is to
become a haven for the ELN, or Army of National Liberation. In
February and March, residents blocked highways to protest the plan,
pointing to the creation of the earlier guerrilla safe zone as a
naive experiment gone totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As originally envisioned in the agreement with the FARC, or
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, only soldiers and police
were to be withdrawn from the so-called zone of disarmament, which
is larger than Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island
combined. But the FARC eventually drove mayors, judges,
prosecutors, tax collectors and priests out, implanting its own
authority _ and inviting in coca producers.
</P>
<P>
   So in all but name, the first demilitarized zone is now an
entity beyond the Colombian state's control. Hence the sardonic
nickname given it by its 60,000 residents: Farclandia. Passengers
landing at the airport in San Vicente del Caguan have their
passports and luggage inspected by rebels; guerrillas staff the
city hall and residents have to deal with them when they need
police protection or a road paved.
</P>
<P>
   The ``zone of encounter'' that is now to be handed over to the
ELN is barely one-tenth the size of the FARC zone, or roughly the
size of Delaware, but its location is much more strategic. So the
dent in Colombian sovereignty may be just as great, even though
this time Pastrana has promised that all civil authorities in the
area ``will continue in the exercise of their functions,'' and
international observers will be allowed in to assure that the ELN
is honoring the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's action is all the more surprising given the
importance that Latin American governments traditionally attach to
the concept of national sovereignty. To maintain the notion
untarnished, countries like Mexico and Venezuela, for example, have
turned down offers of U.S. assistance after natural disasters, and
Chile's government, though full of officials who were persecuted
while Chile was under military rule, repeatedly cited sovereignty
in demanding that Britain release Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   But historical experience also says that sovereignty is one of
those ideas, like the rule of law or military subordination to
civilians, that is more honored in the breach than in practice in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia's case, sovereignty in remote areas often consists
of little more than a flag and a national anthem. Guerrillas and
drug traffickers can move into areas like Caqueta and Putumayo
precisely because the state has never bothered _ or been able _ to
build roads, schools or hospitals there, and the forlorn, neglected
peasants there feel only the most tenuous of connections to the
authorities back in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian state is scarcely alone in failing to back up
assertions of sovereignty with meaningful actions. Many residents
of the area in the heart of the Amazon, where Colombia, Peru and
Brazil share a border, carry the identity cards of all three
countries and use their currencies interchangeably, as if the
frontier did not exist. None of those countries, however, has a
history of reliably supplying services like medical care and
education there; for these, citizens have had to depend on
missionaries.

<P>
   They say necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation
can also be its source. In Colombia, a government frustrated by its
inability to end three decades of warfare with two major guerrilla
insurgencies is now seeking peace by granting both movements one of
the things they crave most: uncontested territory they can call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The move is not without logic, though its many critics contend
that the logic is deeply flawed. The idea was that pulling troops
out of what were already rebel strongholds could create an
atmosphere of good will in peace talks. But that hasn't really
happened so far, and so the effect has been somewhat different:
Colombia has formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full
sovereignty over all its territory.
</P>
<P>
   That has left the two zones a kind of never-never land where it
is not clear who is in charge or how the zones fit into the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing, in a sense, the hollowing-out of government in
critical regions of Latin America and its replacement by
individuals who are, in fact, introducing a narco-government, a
small narco-empire,'' said Peter Romero, the State Department's
senior official for Latin American affairs, last week.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of these two insurgent-controlled areas began 18
months ago, when the government ceded 16,000 square miles to
Colombia's largest guerrilla group, known as the FARC, in an effort
to jump-start peace talks. But the talks have faltered, and the
FARC has only become more powerful. It acts increasingly like a
parallel government and is now planning a ``peace tax'' on wealthy
people and companies in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   The government's move also left Colombia's other big rebel
group, known as the ELN, intensely jealous. So the group began a
sabotage and kidnapping campaign, to which President Andres
Pastrana responded last month by agreeing to concede it a second
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America has had its share of insurgencies, but even at the
height of the Central American civil wars of the 1980s there was
never an arrangement quite like this. Guerrillas exercised de facto
control of parts of El Salvador and Contras ranged freely over
northern Nicaragua, but they certainly did not do so with the
consent of the governments they were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concession has not gone over well with ordinary
Colombians, especially those who must live in the area that is to

AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA: A PRESIDENT MISAPPREHENDS A KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tone and substance of the letter was so peculiar that some
officials in Washington thought it was a hoax. In a five-page
letter to President Clinton last month, South Africa's president,
Thabo Mbeki, argued that his country had to chart its own course in
dealing with AIDS, including consulting those who challenged
prevailing views on the causes and treatments of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A ``campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism'' akin
to ``medieval book-burning'' was keeping such voices from being
heard, Mbeki wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was no hoax, and it touched off an uproar, in part
because South Africa's democratic politics and advanced industry
make it the natural leader in the fight against a disease that has
devastated Africa. This status was acknowledged in the nation's
selection to sponsor this year's international AIDS conference. Yet
here was Nelson Mandela's anointed successor questioning many years
of scientific research. Never mind that Mandela hardly mentioned
the disease during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, many South Africans have engaged in a kind
of psychoanalysis of the 57-year-old president they elected last
year. Why did this cultured man, educated as an economist at Sussex
University in England, take such a position? What does he gain from
it?
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is the only African leader to have questioned the
consensus theory on AIDS. He has, moreover, an embattled history
with the disease, having first become embroiled in the scientific
debate three years ago, when Mandela's cabinet backed research into
Virodene, a supposed cure developed locally that turned out to be
carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   Attacked by scientists, the health minister in Mandela's
government, which Mbeki was virtually running, refused to back
down, and it later turned out that stock in the company set up to
make Virodene had been given to the ruling African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Virodene was discredited long before Mbeki began publicly
questioning the causes of AIDS, so there seems little reason to
believe that led to his present position. But it helped create the
ill-will that exists between the scientific establishment and the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mbeki stunned experts by questioning the safety of
the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT, which the government has declined
to distribute to pregnant women despite studies indicating that it
could greatly reduce the transmission of the virus to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AIDS activists are shocked by Mbeki's refusal to accept
the standard scientific model of the disease. Political analysts,
meanwhile, say they can see little political gain for him or for
his party (which took 66 percent of the vote in the 1999 elections)
in his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Most see it as a personal decision from a man who, since his
teens, has lived largely in exile, petitioning world leaders to
help fight apartheid. They say that Mbeki's desire to reject
Western thinking _ and condescension _ is strong, and his speeches
have repeatedly called for an African renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very keen on doing things in an African way and not just
accepting the gospel from the West,'' said Raymond Louw, editor of
the weekly newsletter Southern Africa Report. ``You hear this all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking about a cheap cure may also have played a part,
some say, since South Africa isn't nearly rich enough to afford
$15,000 AIDS cocktails, (or even $3,000 ones, if drug companies cut
prices, as they indicated they might last week) for the 13 percent
of the population that is infected.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that Mbeki simply couldn't help himself. He has
repeatedly displayed a stubborn inclination to master technical
issues in his own way, and in a highly personal speech recently he
told of Internet searches with dictionaries at his side as he
looked for information that might help him formulate his country's
AIDS policies.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his current approach _ convening a ``What Causes AIDS?''
panel divided between orthodox AIDS researchers and those who
believe it is caused by malnutrition and parasites _ will help or
hurt his country is an open question. Heading the panel of 33
experts is William Makgoba, who runs South Africa's equivalent of
the National Institute of Health. Makgoba strongly supports the
standard model of AIDS, but said that bringing the dissidents
``into the tent'' will be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba believes Mbeki to be a ``very intellectual person'' who
is trying to inform himself on a disease that is ravaging his
country. He wishes, however, that Mbeki had informed himself in
private, fearing that he will be classified ``as one of those
African leaders who doesn't care about science or technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of
Witwatersrand, says that Mbeki shows the personality traits of what
he calls ``an interferer, not a delegater.'' It is a trait that has
come up in other arenas as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lodge pointed out, Mbeki is shuttling back and
forth to Zimbabwe, trying to ease the tensions over the violence
that has broken out as supporters of President Robert Mugabe have
seized white-owned farms. But Lodge said Mbeki should let his
foreign minister do the traveling. ``He is running up to Harare
every two minutes like an office boy,'' Lodge said. ``The AIDS
issue is the same. Maybe he will learn the lesson that a head of
state does not busy himself with details.''

DOCTOR LASHES OUT IN PROZAC BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dr. Jonathan O. Cole, a Harvard psychiatrist who was
one of the first to suggest that Prozac and similar antidepressants
could precipitate suicide, is now criticizing drug companies and
the US Food and Drug Administration, saying they are failing to
take the problem seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Cole made his complaint in support of a federal court lawsuit
that claims the drug Zoloft, a chemical cousin of Prozac, caused a
13-year-old Kansas City youth to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe our 1990 article was correct and it does
happen,'' Cole said of the alleged suicide-antidepressant link that
he and other McLean Hospital researchers first suggested a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cole had remained silent amid manufacturers' efforts to
discredit his research, the Boston psychiatrist said he was angered
by the actions of Zoloft's maker, Pfizer Inc., in fighting the
lawsuit brought by the family of Matthew Miller, the Missouri
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   The youth had been taking Zoloft for only a week when he hanged
himself in his bedroom closet on July 28, 1997. His parents insist
he had never displayed suicidal tendencies and had never been
treated for behavioral problems. They say the boy had been
unusually restless and jumpy in the days before his death _
symptoms that Cole and other researchers say are warning signs of
alleged antidepressant-related suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against this background . . . There is a clear prima facie
case that Zoloft caused Matthew Miller to commit suicide,'' said
Dr. David Healy, a British researcher who is the family's chief
expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer lawyers, calling Healy a practitioner of ``junk
science,'' are asking Kansas City Federal District Court Judge
Katheryn Vratil to disallow Healy as an expert witness. Cole was
recruited by the Houston law firm representing the Miller family to
vouch for Healy's scientific rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer representatives say there is no credible scientific
evidence that Zoloft and related drugs precipitate suicide. Company
officials did not return telephone calls Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since Cole and Harvard colleagues first reported
on early cases of extreme agitation among people taking Prozac and
related antidepressants, use of these drugs _ called selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs _ has reached 84 million
prescriptions a year.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale cost of SSRI prescriptions last year was $7
billion, a 15 percent jump from 1998, according to IMS Health, a
Pennsylvania research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, US physicians are prescribing Prozac, Zoloft, and a
related drug called Paxil for ever-younger patients and for a
broadening list of disorders.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Michigan researcher reported Friday in Boston
that nearly 2 percent of North Carolina children ages 6 to 14
received SSRI drugs in 1998. A growing number of physicians are
giving children prescriptions for SSRIs along with stimulants such
as Ritalin, the researcher said, despite the absence of any studies
supporting such use.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Rushton and his colleagues found that Prozac, Zoloft,
and Paxil are being used widely by children not only for
depression, but for school phobia, anxiety disorders, bed-wetting,
eating disorders, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.
Their study was presented at the annual meeting of the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Academic Societies.
</P>
<P>
   While manufacturers have been successful so far in deflecting
criticism, opponents say the tide may be turning, due to lawsuits,
media reports, books, and statements from prominent scientists such
as Cole.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported a week ago that Eli Lilly and Co., the maker
of Prozac, was aware more than a decade ago that suicidal thoughts
occurred in as many as 1 percent of patients who were given the
drug in early trials. Furthermore, the patent for a new form of
Prozac, invented by physicians at McLean Hospital in Belmont and
scientists at Marlborough-based Sepracor Inc., specifically
mentions suicide as a possible side effect of the original Prozac.
Lily has embraced the new Prozac and plans to market it within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen patients and reviewed cases where an SSRI
unmistakably precipitated a driven preoccupation with suicide,''
said Cole, 74.
</P>
<P>
   Such responses are unusual, Cole said, but they should be taken
more seriously by manufacturers and federal regulators. ``It's a
relatively small problem, but it exists,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, critics say, is that infrequent adverse effects are
magnified when millions of people take a drug every day. ``I sense
the scientific community is beginning to understand they made a
mistake in concluding that they could rule out suicide as an
adverse effect'' from SSRI drugs, said Thomas J. Moore, a drug
industry critic at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many suicides have occurred among the millions
of people who have taken SSRI antidepressants. Richard Ewing, a
lawyer in a firm representing the Miller family, said the FDA had
recorded about 2,000 suicides between 1988 and 1997 that may have
been related to the drugs, but says the agency acknowledges that
this is a small fraction of the probable cases.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, the British researcher, has estimated that as many as
50,000 suicides worldwide may be related to the drugs' use.
</P>
<P>
   Cole cited two studies by Texas researchers in 1993 and 1995
suggesting that about 1 in 200 patients reported having new
suicidal thoughts while on Prozac, while none did while taking an
older non-SSRI drug.
</P>
<P>
   This rate ``sounds about right to me,'' Cole said. It's ``rare
enough to make most physicians not notice the effect, but common
enough to cause serious adverse effects, such as death by suicide,
in a few patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cole said no one has done the large-scale studies necessary
to pin down the frequency of SSRI-related suicides. Such studies
are not easy to do, since suicides are uncommon events even among
clinically depressed people and researchers must distinguish those
related to the underlying depression from those preceded by the
extreme agitation, called akathisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the manufacturers of SSRI drugs could and should have
done these studies, to my knowledge no manufacturer of an SSRI drug
has ever done a study where the primary outcome of interest was to
measure . . . suicidality'' that emerged during treatment, Cole
said in a document filed with the federal court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cole also said an FDA advisory panel convened in 1991 to
consider the alleged SSRI-suicide link ``never came to grips with
the reality or non-reality of the phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers defend drug manufacturers and federal
officials for the way they have responded to studies suggesting a
suicide link. These include Dr. Anthony J. Rothschild of the
University of Massachusetts Medical School, who coauthored a 1991
study that the SSRI critics cite as evidence of a suicide problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and his colleagues administered Prozac to three
patients who had attempted suicide and found they developed severe
agitation and suicidal thoughts once again. Those symptoms subsided
when Prozac was withdrawn or when the drug was countered by one
with calming effects, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Rothschild said he thinks Eli Lilly and Co., Prozac's
manufacturer, and the FDA ``adequately addressed'' the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that disturbs me'' about current SSRI critics,
Rothschild said, ``is the tone that suggests there's almost a
conspiracy to cover up information and not do the right studies.''

SOCIAL SECURITY FIGHT EXPANDS TO STATE RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Wherever he goes, union organizer Martin Berger
travels with a videotape and a VCR in the back seat of his Ford
Crown Victoria as he tells Pennsylvania's senior citizens about US
Senator Rick Santorum's plan to raise the retirement age for Social
Security benefits and to privatize the program.
</P>
<P>
   The shadowy videotape, shot in 1994, shows Santorum talking to a
group of students at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. Before an
unsteady camera, Santorum says he believes that Social Security
should not be paid out until workers hit the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous that we have a retirement age in this country
of age 65 today,'' Santorum says emphatically, noting that many
people receive benefits for two decades before dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Push it back to at least age 70,'' continues the senator, who
is seeking reelection this year. ``I'd go even farther if I could,
but I don't think I could pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore give
competing speeches Monday on their philosophies for Social
Security, the contentious issue is spilling over into House and
Senate races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, for example, vows to hang Bush's plan to
partially privatize Social Security around the necks of every GOP
candidate in the land, whether they embrace his proposal or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a major issue throughout the country,'' said
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is surveying Pennsylvania
voters for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
``Congressional Republicans are deathly afraid of the giant mistake
George Bush is about to make.''
</P>
<P>
   But Santorum and the Republican National Committee are defiant
in the face of the Democratic threats to link Republicans to the
Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they tie it around our neck and parade it around every
American in the country,'' said committee spokesman Chris Taulitz.
``It is the most courageous, boldest proposal ever made in an
election year. If Al Gore and the congressional Democratic
leadership are going to try this, they're going to end up hanging
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has backed away from raising the retirement age, but
he's in the forefront on pushing for younger workers to be allowed
to invest part of their payroll taxes themselves. He says it is
their money and they have a right to try for better returns than
the program currently provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making it a big issue in my campaign,'' Santorum said.
``We're on the offense, not the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's speech in Ontario, Calif., Bush is expected to
propose allowing workers to invest 2 percent of the earnings that
would go to Social Security taxes in the stock market for use when
they retire. In addition, aides said, he may discuss the need to
raise the Social Security retirement age for those who are not
currently near retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who speaks in Ambler, Pa., has said he would preserve the
structure of the current system and shore it up using interest
savings from paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, has eagerly awaited the Bush speech, and
plans to paint the Bush approach as irresponsible and to cast the
governor as a risky choice for retirees. The Bush campaign says
Gore is spreading misinformation and needlessly scaring seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Keystone State, by all accounts a crucial
battleground in the presidential race, there are proportionately
more senior citizens _ 2.5 million people in a state of 12 million
_ than any other state except Florida. Of these, some 250,000 are
union retirees, many of whom are gearing up to fight changes in the
Social Security benefit structure.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the Social Security program in
1934 to support Americans in their later years with modest, regular
payments. Workers pay into the program to support current retirees,
and in turn, rely on future workers to pay for their retirement
benefits. The growing concern is that, as the massive baby boom
generation retires, there won't be enough workers paying in to keep
the system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the recent annual report by Social Security
trustees, there is enough money to fund the program through 2037,
up from last year's estimate of 2034. At that point, payroll tax
revenues will cover just 72 percent of the benefits promised under
current law.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klink, the Democratic congressman who is challenging
Santorum for his Senate seat, calls Social Security ``a sacred bond
between the generations.'' As vehemently as Santorum wants to
change the program, Klink wants to maintain it in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all of a sudden, Rick Santorum and many others are saying
what I pay in is my money,'' Klink said. ``Instead of bridging and
uniting the generations and having them take care of each other,
it's dividing the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   As Klink and Santorum and Bush and Gore argue about what to do,
each is accusing the other of scaring seniors to secure votes.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, for example, said the program is in grave danger of
going bankrupt and if the future insolvency is not addressed now,
it will be much more difficult to deal with later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absolute certainty that Social Security will run
out of money and benefits will be cut and taxes will go up,'' said
Santorum, who ridicules Democrats for refusing to act. ``They're
ignoring the fact that Social Security is in trouble, they're just
saying, `Oh, this is a risky scheme.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Klink, on the other hand, points out that the program is
expected to be solvent for the next 37 years. At most, he believes
there are ``some slight changes that can be made,'' but wants
nothing that would alter the current structure.
</P>
<P>
   He views Santorum's proposals as needless and risky. If the bull
market becomes a bear, Klink says, the federal government would be
left with no choice but to make up for people's investment
shortfalls rather than to leave seniors destitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need the drastic kinds of changes that will destroy
the system that the senator and others are proposing,'' Klink said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Klink and Gore denounce privatization plans, the idea
has gained currency in recent years. President Clinton suggested a
form of it in his last two budgets, and Gore even flirted with the
concept before backing off. In the Senate, Democrats Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and John Breaux of
Louisiana are staunch advocates, as the Bush campaign regularly
points out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bush campaign is fond of touting the privatization
of Social Security as a bipartisan effort, which leaves Kerrey
feeling uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm uncomfortable getting drug in as political cover,'' said
Kerrey, who serves as cochair of Gore's presidential campaign in
Nebraska. And he says he disagrees with Bush officials that Gore's
criticisms amount to a scare tactic.
</P>
<P>
   What he hopes will happen this election year is that the
candidates will thoroughly debate the pros and cons of the various
Social Security proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can end the campaign with a mandate,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, the union organizer who is president of the Pennsylvania
State Council of Senior Citizens, is working to make sure that the
next president and the Congress are given just such a mandate. But
he wants a mandate to preserve Social Security the way it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why mess with this system?'' asked Berger. ``It's good till''
2037 ``if we don't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the state, talking to retired carpenters,
steelworkers, autoworkers, and others, Berger tells seniors that
the nation can't afford the trillion-plus dollars that it would
cost to switch to Santorum and Bush's plan, and he reminds them
that the people who stand to benefit most are the ones earning
commissions from the investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a false issue, and all the lobbyists are being paid
big money by Wall Street to get this done,'' Berger said. ``It
would be a bonanza for them.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Religious belief needs no government aid
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, No. 2 Republican honcho in the U.S. House, wants the
national government to start making it easier for you to get
religion, if he can persuade enough other members, especially of
his own party, to go along.
</P>
<P>
   You may already have religion _ most do _ but if so DeLay
believes you are under attack and need federal protection. Or
perhaps you've figured that, if you want to get religion, all you
have to do is show up. That, DeLay suggests, is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   So he is pushing two bits of legislation that, he says, ought to
be among the ornaments of a Republican sweep in the presidential
and congressional elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   One would coattail on civil rights legislation by declaring it
illegally discriminatory to withhold tax money that is available
for public purposes _ public education, for instance _ from
religious groups with similar aims _ religious schools, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Companion legislation would bar states and school districts from
prohibiting voluntary religious activity in public schools, so
that, say, Christian evangelical students, or Hare Krishnas for
that matter, could get up classroom prayer circles or whatever and
work on other students to join in.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of DeLay's program would be a level of government
support for religion unprecedented since our proto-theocratic
colonies, with a decided tilt, as a practical matter, in favor of
the largest and the most proselytizing faiths.
</P>
<P>
   This radicalism is necessary, DeLay said in a recent speech,
because good Americans are in danger from ``a cultural coup d'etat
by the fashionable elite.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``privileged few are determined to discredit and
ultimately replace core American traditions'' _ family, morality,
truth itself. The elite, he says, ``is concentrated in the media,
universities, tax-exempt foundations, the legal profession and the
arts: wherever opinions are made.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to cover rather more social territory than can
be called concentrated, and arguably the most volcanic eruptions of
opinion these days are from televangelists and right-wing radio
talk shows. (And often from Tom DeLay.)
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay's contrary reading is a commonplace of the religious
right: a poor-me belief that secularists or even mere
separationists are out to harry and grind down the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's own figures make hash of that. He says only 6 percent of
Americans are agnostics or atheists, but 22 percent of the ``media
elite'' and 32 percent of the ``entertainment elite'' are. If so,
that means that respectively 78 percent and 68 percent are
believers.
</P>
<P>
   And as DeLay himself points out, Americans are the most
religiously believing and religiously active of all developed,
industrialized peoples.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an antireligious coup under way, it is hard to find
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It does not seem to have occurred to DeLay that religion is
flourishing in this country, not despite but because of the
separation of church and state.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A bird in the hand
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was walking up from the far part of the back
yard. My wife was waiting at the door. When I was hardly halfway to
the house, she yelled to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bird in the bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I yelled back, ``you'd better do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did,'' she said, disappearing into the house and
shutting the door after her.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's her one cure-all: Tell me, turn around and walk
away.
</P>
<P>
   A bird in the house. Oh me, oh my. I can sympathize with a bird
in a house.
</P>
<P>
   It sees a window. There's the outdoors. It has only to fly
through the opening, and it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ THUD! _ all of a sudden it's knocked silly by something
it can't see. The bird recovers its senses and takes off flying
again for the opening, almost there, almost free ...
</P>
<P>
   The invisible force field brings it down again.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the bird's anguish, its fear, its frustration, time and
again banging its head against a barrier it has no way of
comprehending, window glass.
</P>
<P>
   Ever have a day like that? Yeah, me too. I can easily envision
what it must be like to be a bird caught in a house. I'd do what I
could.
</P>
<P>
   I tiptoed into the bedroom, looking this way and that, up and
down and around the room.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, I spotted the bird clinging to a window curtain,
already having given up, already having resigned itself that
there's no way out of this death trap.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaking up behind it, I reached out my hand ever so slowly and
then _ SNATCH!
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe the luck. I got it in one.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a handful, but exquisite in every way. There's no
beauty quite so sleek as that of aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   I stared into the black, black, blackness of its eyes, and it
stared into mine. I knew what the bird was seeing. The bird was
seeing death.
</P>
<P>
   The only question in its mind was whether I'd eat it feet first
or head first. It bobbed its head. Here, it was saying. Be quick,
please.
</P>
<P>
   I was quick. I quickly walked outside, stretched out my hand and
gave it a little boost in the release, as if it needed any.
</P>
<P>
   Wings flapping as hard as wings have ever flapped, it took off
straight up, thinking at any second it'd be brought crashing down
again by the invisible force.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time. This time it soared, circling a wide, upward
spiraling circle way above house and trees, and then it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the elation, the exhilaration, the freedom!
</P>
<P>
   Ever have a day like that? Neither have I. But I've seen what
it's like.

NEXT TO `IMPOSSIBLE': JOHN WOO TACKLES `MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of John Woo directing Tom Cruise in a scene
from ``Mission: Impossible 2.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Thousands of fans may devour John Woo's movies again and again,
savoring the Hong Kong action auteur's every film virtually frame
by frame.
 &HT;    But Woo himself isn't one of them.
 &HT;    ``I never like to watch my movies twice,'' says Woo, who
achieved cult-legend status with his blood-drenched epics ``The
Killer'' (1989) and ``Hard-Boiled'' (1992) before scoring in
America with ``Broken Arrow'' (1996) and ``Face/Off'' (1997).
``I've done it. I put it on the side and go to another thing _ I
just want to keep moving on.
 &HT;    ``My friends will ask me about a line: `In ``The Killer,'' there
was a line that blah-blah-blah. It was very interesting.' I'll say,
`Yes. But I don't remember.'
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I watch television and I'll switch channels,'' Woo
adds. ``I'll see a shot of a helicopter blowing up and think, `That
looks pretty nice.' I'll watch a little longer, and `Oh, that's my
movie. ``Broken Arrow.'' Ah. Oh, yeah.'
 &HT;    ``Even my favorite movies _ `The Killer' and `Face/Off' _ I can
only watch one or two times.''
 &HT;    Woo's latest film treads familiar ground, picking up where Brian
De Palma left off with ``Mission: Impossible'' (1996). It's Woo who
puts Tom Cruise through his paces in the May 24 sequel, however, so
it won't feel entirely the same.
 &HT;    ``Mission: Impossible 2'' follows superspy Ethan Hunt (Cruise)
as he embarks on a fresh assignment, one which involves teaming up
with a sassy thief (Thandie Newton) and his support team _ among
them returning player Ving Rhames _ to thwart a nefarious plot of a
former colleague (Dougray Scott).
 &HT;    ``When Tom asked me to do `Mission: Impossible 2' I was very
surprised,'' Woo says, relaxing on a couch at the Four Seasons
hotel in Los Angeles. ``I told him I was very interested in working
with him, because I like him and respect him as an actor and a
filmmaker.
 &HT;    ``But the one condition I had was that the movie had to be all
about character, all about humanity,'' he says. ``My kind of movie
is always about character, and I told him that, frankly, I didn't
like the first `Mission: Impossible' _ the story confused me and it
was a little too cold.''
 &HT;    The director is an easygoing sort and, though his English
sometimes falters, he gets his point across.
 &HT;    ``I also told him that I don't like to make high-tech or sci-fi
movies,'' Woo says, ``because I'm not good at them. I like to watch
them, but I don't know how to make them. So I said, `If the film is
all about people being human, I'd love to do it.' That's what Tom
wanted, too.''
 &HT;    Which is a good thing, because Cruise is not only one of the top
stars on the planet, but also the producer of ``Mission: Impossible
2.'' Still, Woo says, he never fretted about the risk of losing
control of his film in midstream.
 &HT;    ``I knew Tom respected me a lot,'' he says. ``He wanted to work
with me for a reason. He liked my style, and he wanted me to keep
my style.
 &HT;    ``I never worried about power,'' Woo adds. ``It wasn't in my
mind that Tom was a big star. I knew he was a big star, but when we
talked and worked together, we were like friends. I just wanted to
create a story, make my hero look special and have all the other
characters look perfect.''
 &HT;    ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' Woo devotees will be pleased to
learn, incorporates all of the director's usual stylistic
flourishes.
 &HT;    ``The slow motion, the guy firing two guns, the doves _ I like
the imagery,'' he says. ``In `Mission: Impossible 2' you see a dove
after a door blows off. Tom walks by the door and a white dove
flies across the frame, leading him out.
 &HT;    ``The idea came up on the set,'' the director says. ``I wanted
to use a dove to represent Ethan Hunt _ Ethan is as charming and
pure as a dove. I just wanted to give the character a little more
spirituality and have it be poetic.''
 &HT;    There's a fine line between unifying personal imagery and having
his movies seem like retreads of his earlier work, but Woo doesn't
seem concerned.
 &HT;    ``I don't worry about repeating myself,'' he says. ``I just
shoot the things I like.
 &HT;    ``When I met Tom, he wanted to do something very challenging,''
the director says. ``He told me he'd never fired a gun in his
movies. He also told me how much he liked Bruce Lee. I thought,
`OK, great.' That gave me a lot of inspiration on how to design
great action for Tom. And he did almost every stunt himself.
 &HT;    ``So I don't worry about repeating myself,'' Woo concludes. ``I
just try to use the imagery in a new way.''
 &HT;    Next up is ``Wind Talkers,'' a World War II drama that will
reunite him with ``Face/Off'' star Nicolas Cage. The film concerns
the relationship between two Marines, one white and the other a
Native American.
 &HT;    ``It's based on a true event,'' Woo says excitedly. ``During the
war the Marines used the Navajo language as a code, and the
Japanese couldn't get it.
 &HT;    ``The story is about these men who don't understand each other,
but get to know each other and work together,'' he adds. ``It's a
story about friendship and honor. I'm so glad to be working with
Nic again, and we're about to start the rest of the casting.''
 &HT;    If code-breakers getting to know each other doesn't sound much
like the high-kicking action epics which made Woo famous, well,
that's the whole point. The director, now an American citizen who
resides with his family in Los Angeles, is living his dream and
making the films he wants to make.
 &HT;    ``I still want to do a musical,'' he says. ``I also want to do a
Western. I'd love to do a musical like `Singing in the Rain'
(1952). `West Side Story' (1961) is one of my favorite musicals of
all time.
 &HT;    ``I'm crazy about Westerns, about John Wayne and John Ford, and
Sergio Leone films _ I just want to make one,'' Woo says. ``Another
thing I want to do is make a movie like `Lawrence of Arabia'
(1962), a big epic. That's one of my biggest dreams.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot I want to do,'' he concludes, ``and one of the
great things about being in America is that I'm getting the
chance.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jackie Chan with Owen Wilson in a scene
from ``Shanghai Noon.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Jackie Chan is doing a little redecorating.
 &HT;    He's being interviewed at New York's posh Essex House, but the
furniture layout doesn't meet his standards. So he picks up a heavy
oak chair and moves it _ and the reporter sitting in it _ to a new
spot.
 &HT;    So he's not just strong, he's picky.
 &HT;    ``I like things to be perfect,'' he says.
 &HT;    They aren't far from it, at least where his career is concerned.
The Hong Kong action star has succeeded where so many have failed
in breaking into the American and international markets. After
earning a mere $5 million for the smash hit ``Rush Hour'' (1998),
he's receiving triple that for ``Shanghai Noon,'' a comedy/action
Western set to open May 26.
 &HT;    And the money was apparently well spent _ Disney is so confident
in the film's prospects that a screenwriter is already halfway done
with the sequel.
 &HT;    Being Jackie Chan does have its sore spots _ literally, as he
point out with an informal ``damages tour'' of the impact his
penchant for flamboyant stunts has had on his body.
 &HT;    ``Concussion, bleeding, stitches,'' he says, pointing to his
head.
 &HT;    He touches his nose.
 &HT;    ``Broken three times,'' he says.
 &HT;    Teeth: ``Four gone in bad jump.''
 &HT;    Scalp: ``Ripped open.''
 &HT;    Fingers: ``Sprained, broken, broken, nearly ripped off.''
 &HT;    Shoulder: ``Broken.''
 &HT;    Other shoulder: ``Broken.''
 &HT;    Elbow: ``Broken,'' he says. ``Many times.''
 &HT;    Legs: ``Broken, broken, broken.''
 &HT;    Ribs: ``Cracked. Bruised. Fractured.''
 &HT;    Knees: ``Twisted, broken, crushed.''
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean you should expect to see him taking it easy
in ``Shanghai Noon.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, I do these stunts for one reason,'' he says. ``It's so
much fun. I love it _ I love the challenge!''
 &HT;    Occasionally, he admits, things get out of hand.
 &HT;    ``Well, once I do Hong Kong action movie where I am supposed to
jump from window to tree,'' he recalls. ``It seems easy, but then
the tree branch break and I fall a couple of hundred feet.
 &HT;    ``I got a concussion so bad that the blood was pouring out of my
ear and wouldn't stop for hours,'' Chan says, shrugging. ``No big
deal.''
 &HT;    ``Shanghai Noon,'' based on an idea by Chan, is set in the Old
West, with Chan as a member of the Chinese Imperial Guard who teams
with a roguish train robber (Owen Wilson) to rescue a kidnaped
Chinese princess (Lucy Liu).
 &HT;    ``It's like `The Odd Couple' with horses,'' Chan says.
 &HT;    It's the latest step in an incident-filled life which began in
Hong Kong on April 7, 1954, after what he says was a horrific
11-month pregnancy which ended when his mother delivered a 12-pound
boy via Caesarean section.
 &HT;    The delivery was delayed, he says, because his impoverished
parents couldn't afford the $26 to pay for the surgery.
 &HT;    ``A female doctor approached my father with a deal,'' the actor
says. ``If my father would allow her to adopt me, she would pay for
my mother's surgery and medical expenses.
 &HT;    ``In Hong Kong, poor children were regularly given to their
wealthier friends,'' he adds, ``but my parents always said that
they knew I was a special one. They said no to this doctor, and our
family friends helped them pay the expenses.''
 &HT;    His childhood was spent surrounded by luxury, Chan says, though
his family couldn't share in it.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have much money,'' he says, ``but we lived in a
mansion where my father was a cook and a handyman for the French
ambassador to Hong Kong. My mother worked in the laundry room of
their mansion.
 &HT;    ``I think it taught me humility,'' he concludes, ``and that you
have to work so hard in order to achieve anything in this life.''
 &HT;    His father reinforced that lesson with a strict physical
regimen.
 &HT;    ``He would wake me up at dawn for tough workouts of running,
lifting bags of sand and doing military-style push-ups,'' Chan
recalls. ``We would also spend hours practicing martial-arts moves.
At 5, I learned the basics of Northern-style kung fu.''
 &HT;    The following year, when his parents took jobs in Australia,
Chan stayed behind as a student at the China Drama Academy, where
he spent 10 years as a virtual indentured servant to a famed
martial artist, Yu Jim-yuen.
 &HT;    ``He was a tough master,'' Chan says. ``He gave you food,
protection and the best training in the world, but there was a
steep price.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how I survived,'' he concludes. ``Sometimes I say
`Thank you' to my childhood, because it was the toughest training
of all.
 &HT;    ``I guess I cannot complain,'' he admits. ``Some students at
that school are washing dishes now in China _ they are the ones who
should be complaining. I have it easy.''
 &HT;    His turning point came when, to help the school make ends meet,
its students were given permission to work as film extras. Chan
took to stunt work immediately, and at 17 left school to pursue a
career in films.
 &HT;    ``Being a stunt man made me old before my time,'' he says. ``I
was risking my life for a few dollars a day. But they kept hiring
me. I was called whenever the most dangerous scene needed to be
shot _ I have no fear.''
 &HT;    From stunt work, he moved to acting in low-budget movies, then
higher-budget actioners such as Bruce Lee's ``Fists of Fury''
(1972).
 &HT;    ``They kept calling me the next Bruce Lee,'' Chan recalls, ``but
I didn't like the comparison. He kick high, I kick low. He never
smiles, I like to smile. I didn't want to be Bruce Lee _ I wanted
to be Buster Keaton and Fred Astaire.''
 &HT;    It took a while for American audiences to warm to his unique
combination of comedy and action.
 &HT;    ``Before `Rush Hour' I had many flops in America,'' Chan says.
``I insisted on the scene in `Rush Hour' where I'm hanging from a
street sign on Hollywood Boulevard _ it was my way of saying, `It's
all or nothing this time.'''
 &HT;    ``All'' came out the winner, as the film grossed $160 million
worldwide and jumpstarted his American career. Needless to say, a
sequel is in the works, due in 2001.
 &HT;    Which means more trouble for Chan as he tries to keep up with
his voluble co-star, Chris Tucker.
 &HT;    ``Oh, that guy Chris gave me a lot of problems,'' he says,
laughing. ``First time I meet Chris, he keep talking, talking,
talking. I have to finally say, `Excuse me.' I go to bathroom, call
my manager and say, `He don't shut up! And I don't know what he's
saying. He talks so fast.'''
 &HT;    The sequel will feature that patented Chan action, of course,
though he admits that at 46 his action days are numbered.
 &HT;    ``I think three more years,'' he says thoughtfully. ``Things
hurt now. But the good thing is that these action films are leaving
a good foundation for my next career. When I'm done with action
films, I want to do stuff like Michael Douglas _ I want to do
drama.''
 &HT;    For now, though, he still loves the stunts.
 &HT;    ``I look out a window 20 stories high, I know I can jump out of
it safely,'' he says cheerfully. ``That's because I only jump down
a couple of floors, and then jump to another roof and then jump
onto a ledge and then jump to the ground.
 &HT;    ``Do you think I'm nuts?''

HOT AGAIN: THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ARE BACK IN A GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Dave Grohl doesn't let his band, Foo Fighters, open for just
anybody.
 &HT;    He was a member of Nirvana, after all, which set standards of
credibility for modern rock bands that have endured since the early
1990s.
 &HT;    But when the Red Hot Chili Peppers invited Foo Fighters to play
several months' worth of dates during this spring and summer, Grohl
didn't hesitate.
 &HT;    ``I can't really think of many other bands that we'd do it
with,'' Grohl says. ``We've been asked by lots of bands to be the
opening band du jour, but it seems like with the Chili Peppers it's
kind of an honor, because they're an institution in their own
right.''
 &HT;    That institution dates back 22 years, since frontman Anthony
Kiedis and bassist Flea _ a.k.a. Michael Balzary _ founded the
Chili Peppers while they were students at Los Angeles' Fairfax High
School.
 &HT;    With carefree irreverence _ including stage appearances naked
except for strategically placed tube socks _ the group has mixed
funk, punk and rock into a distinctive sonic brew that owes props
equally to the MC5, Iggy Pop, the Sex Pistols and George Clinton,
who produced its second album, ``Freaky Styley'' (1985).
 &HT;    It's also been a survival story, with the Chili Peppers carrying
on despite the drug-overdose death of guitarist Hillel Slovak,
other members' addictions _ one of which Kiedis chronicled in their
1992 hit ``Under the Bridge'' _ a stream of eight other musicians
who have joined Kiedis and Flea in the group over the years, and
the distinction of being the band that fiddled while Woodstock 1999
burned.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Kiedis claims that the band never considered
quitting.
 &HT;    ``It never occurred to us not to do this,'' he says. ``At least
not seriously.''
 &HT;    Actually, the Chili Peppers haven't simply survived, they've
thrived. Their latest album, ``Californication'' (1999), is a
multimillion-selling smash that won a Grammy Award and has spun off
the radio hits ``Scar Tissue'' and ``Other Side.''
 &HT;    Drummer Chad Smith calls the new album ``a rebirth'' for the
band. It is their first since ``One Hot Minute'' (1995), which,
despite selling a million copies, was perceived as a disappointment
both creatively and commercially.
 &HT;    Smith credits that rejuvenation to the band's reunion with
guitarist John Frusciante, who was only 18 when he joined the group
in 1988, and was on board for its breakthrough albums ``Mother's
Milk'' (1989) and ``Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``The chemistry with the four of us is the best lineup, I think,
to make Red Hot Chili Peppers music,'' Smith says. ``I was anxious
to see if that would work again. It's really like getting a second
chance. We're all in a really good place. It's exciting again _
we're playing music for fun and enjoying ourselves.''
 &HT;    Frusciante was struggling with a debilitating drug addiction
when he unexpectedly quit in 1992, while the Chili Peppers were
touring in Japan and shortly before they were due to headline that
year's Lollapalooza festival. He tried his hand at a solo career,
but most of his time away from the group was spent either taking
drugs or trying to get off them.
 &HT;    It was Flea who first raised the idea of Frusciante returning to
the band. After visiting him in rehab, he felt that Frusciante was
genuinely clean. The Chili Peppers were without a guitarist, after
the departure of Frusciante's replacement, Dave Navarro of Jane's
Addiction, so he thought the time might be right to bring everybody
back together.
 &HT;    He broached the subject with Kiedis and Smith while the three
were watching a Los Angeles Lakers game on television.
 &HT;    ``He said, `What do you think about bringing John in again?'''
Smith recalls, ``and I was like, `Wow. Really?'
 &HT;    ``Because when he left, it was bad, really bad _ especially
between him and Anthony,'' Smith says. ``They weren't even
talking.''
 &HT;    But it didn't take long for the group to see that Frusciante had
indeed changed course and had rediscovered the passion for music
that had driven his first stint as a Pepper.
 &HT;    ``He was just so happy to be playing, and it's all about the
music and (being) in his favorite band, and it's really like that
again,'' Smith says. ``Now he's really focused, and he's really
inspiring to play with.
 &HT;    ``It's like, we were in the studio all day and all night. Then
he goes home and plays guitar to, like, the Ramones' `Rocket to
Russia,''' the drummer adds. ``He learns every little solo on the
Led Zeppelin BBC record. The next day he'll say `What did you do?'
and I'm like, `I went home and slept, dude.'
 &HT;    ``He's just all about music and art, all day long,'' Smith says.
``That's just what he lives for now.''
 &HT;    With Frusciante back on board, the Peppers repaired to Flea's
garage to jam out the songs for ``Californication.''
 &HT;    ``For our band, it's really important to just get in a room and
make noise and have that spontaneous musical interplay,'' Smith
says.
 &HT;    Co-producer Rick Rubin helped to hone the final list of cuts, as
well as developing the title track and a few others.
 &HT;    ``I think we're getting better at writing songs,'' Smith says.
``It just sounds relaxed. It sounds like how we did it _ we just
got in there and got good performances, like we were really
prepared ... We were happy to be playing together again, and that
probably comes through.''
 &HT;    Smith and the others simply hope the feeling lasts. They've
taken steps to protect it _ most notably reducing the grueling
rigor of their tour schedule, which they believe contributed to
members' drug addictions in the past.
 &HT;    ``With us, it seems like something always happens,'' Smith says
with a laugh, but he quickly adds that he's confident that this
time it will last.
 &HT;    ``When things go well and everyone's in a good mood, and you
make a good record and everybody's digging it, that really makes
things go a lot smoother,'' the drummer says. ``So I think we're
looking forward to some really good times ahead.''

 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 3. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every television show needs something unique if it's to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a unique character, such as ``Seinfeld's'' Kramer. It
can be a favorite setting, such as the Central Perk coffee house on
``Friends.'' It can be a unifying story line that people can relate
to, such as ``Frasier's'' search for romance.
</P>
<P>
   But while network writers and producers struggle to find hooks
to keep viewers coming back every week, the World Wrestling
Federation continues to make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, there appears to be no stopping the WWF
juggernaut. It has taken the term ``sports entertainment'' and
turned it into four hours a week of prime-time excitement, 52 weeks
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw Is War'' airs Mondays, originating as a live broadcast on
the USA Network. Week in and week out, ``Raw'' tops the national
cable ratings, and on May 1 it grabbed more than 7 million
households, equivalent to a 9.1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Thursday-night ``Smackdown!'' may have
single-handedly saved UPN. It has become the struggling network's
most-watched program, giving it a stranglehold on the coveted 18-34
male demographic _ particularly impressive, considering that UPN
isn't even available in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pin down the secret to the WWF's success.
Unpredictability and improvisation are two of its strong suits, but
far from the only ones. Recently we sat down with four WWF stars to
discuss some of the keys to their popularity. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; STRONG FEMALES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the WWF has more than its share of
beautiful women, but they definitely don't see themselves as window
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about sex,'' says the single-named Tori, a
member of the infamous D-Generation X crew. ``Any sexual aspect is
good and desirable by the viewers, but it's about being physical as
well. The women are continuing to step up to the plate, and that
was really headed up by Chyna.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike are drawn to Chyna, billed as ``The Ninth
Wonder of the World'' and her ability to tackle all obstacles. She
became the first woman to compete in the ``Royal Rumble'' and
``King of the Ring,'' and has even held the Intercontinental Title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that, here in the WWF, you can actually do
it all,'' Tori says.
</P>
<P>
   She rejects criticism from some fans who believe that the WWF's
women are exploited or condescended to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see them tripping on the boy-girl thing,'' she says.
``You know, boys ought not to be hitting girls. But this is
entertainment. It's suspension of disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything Tori wouldn't do in the ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a pudding match,'' she says with a smile. ``I
always thought I'd refuse that. Basically, if it's all in the
context of the story line, I don't think anybody would have a
problem with it.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GETTING PHYSICAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the outcome of the matches is known before the wrestlers
get into the ring. Get over it _ millions of fans have. And however
``fake'' wrestling may be, its physicality is definitely real.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Chris Benoit. Billed as ``The Crippler,'' Benoit is one
of the WWF's most physical wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my character is my aggressiveness and tenacity in the
ring,'' the Canadian-born grappler says. ``But a lot of people
don't realize what goes on outside the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   For Benoit, that means maintaining a rigorous workout regimen,
healthy diet and proper sleep _ despite the WWF's tough travel
schedule, which includes more than 200 live shows every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most sports, we don't get an offseason with three or
four months of recuperation time,'' Benoit says. ``It's a
demanding, year-round, 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered numerous injuries during his 14-year career _
among them a broken ankle and torn elbow ligaments _ but none of
them rivals being knocked unconscious in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst feeling,'' Benoit says. ``You wake up staring
at the lights on the ceiling, hearing people screaming, and you
don't know where you are or what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, he says, he has no regrets about his choice of
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a childhood dream,'' he says. ``We get our bodies
thrown around a lot, and it beats the heck out of our joints _ I
even have a hard time getting out of bed some mornings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is all I've ever wanted to do.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CHARISMA COUNTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious about the importance of a wrestler's
personality, there's no better person to ask than Chris Jericho.
``Y2J'' is as well known for his humorous ramblings and smart-aleck
remarks as he is for his trademark finishing move, ``The Walls of
Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him one question, and he'll take over the rest of the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   So, Chris, how important is it for a wrestler to have charisma
and personality?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year 2000, I believe that one of the most _ if not the
most _ important thing in the business is to have charisma, a
charismatic character, and to have a persona that entertains
people,'' Jericho says. ``A good character is someone that people
can identify with, attach to and care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sports entertainment,'' he says. ``It's very important
to be a great athlete who can wrestle a tremendous match, but I
think the most important thing is to entertain the people, and to
have the interview skills and the charisma that people can see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I step in the ring, I look at it like one big
party, and I'm the party host,'' Jericho adds. ``It's up to me to
make sure that people have a good time. I'll always do my best to
make sure that happens, and I'll do whatever it takes to get a
reaction from the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make sure that they leave the arena thinking, `I had
a good time, and Chris Jericho was tremendous tonight.''' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; STAR POWER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The WWF has a starmaking machine that rivals old-time Hollywood
at its peak. Sure, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin may be the
top draws, but they're only two of the organization's numerous
stars.
</P>
<P>
   To understand that, simply watch a telecast or attend an event
to see how the crowd reacts when Too Cool starts dancing or when
the entrance music is played for Edge and Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, nobody builds a star better than the WWF,''
Dwayne Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   He should know, because as The Rock he has become one of the
most popular wrestlers ever. He hosted ``Saturday Night Live'' in
March, his book ``The Rock Says'' (Regan Books, 2000) went to No. 1
on the New York Times best-seller list and he recently finished
shooting a role as the Scorpion King in ``The Mummy 2.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists, however, that his success is based less on his
personal appeal than on the WWF's canny shaping of its product to
win over mass audiences.
</P>
<P>

 (Includes a color slide of John Woo directing Tom Cruise in a scene
from ``Mission: Impossible 2.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Thousands of fans may devour John Woo's movies again and again,
savoring the Hong Kong action auteur's every film virtually frame
by frame.
 &HT;    But Woo himself isn't one of them.
 &HT;    ``I never like to watch my movies twice,'' says Woo, who
achieved cult-legend status with his blood-drenched epics ``The
Killer'' (1989) and ``Hard-Boiled'' (1992) before scoring in
America with ``Broken Arrow'' (1996) and ``Face/Off'' (1997).
``I've done it. I put it on the side and go to another thing _ I
just want to keep moving on.
 &HT;    ``My friends will ask me about a line: `In ``The Killer,'' there
was a line that blah-blah-blah. It was very interesting.' I'll say,
`Yes. But I don't remember.'
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I watch television and I'll switch channels,'' Woo
adds. ``I'll see a shot of a helicopter blowing up and think, `That
looks pretty nice.' I'll watch a little longer, and `Oh, that's my
movie. ``Broken Arrow.'' Ah. Oh, yeah.'
 &HT;    ``Even my favorite movies _ `The Killer' and `Face/Off' _ I can
only watch one or two times.''
 &HT;    Woo's latest film treads familiar ground, picking up where Brian
De Palma left off with ``Mission: Impossible'' (1996). It's Woo who
puts Tom Cruise through his paces in the May 24 sequel, however, so
it won't feel entirely the same.
 &HT;    ``Mission: Impossible 2'' follows superspy Ethan Hunt (Cruise)
as he embarks on a fresh assignment, one which involves teaming up
with a sassy thief (Thandie Newton) and his support team _ among
them returning player Ving Rhames _ to thwart a nefarious plot of a
former colleague (Dougray Scott).
 &HT;    ``When Tom asked me to do `Mission: Impossible 2' I was very
surprised,'' Woo says, relaxing on a couch at the Four Seasons
hotel in Los Angeles. ``I told him I was very interested in working
with him, because I like him and respect him as an actor and a
filmmaker.
 &HT;    ``But the one condition I had was that the movie had to be all
about character, all about humanity,'' he says. ``My kind of movie
is always about character, and I told him that, frankly, I didn't
like the first `Mission: Impossible' _ the story confused me and it
was a little too cold.''
 &HT;    The director is an easygoing sort and, though his English
sometimes falters, he gets his point across.
 &HT;    ``I also told him that I don't like to make high-tech or sci-fi
movies,'' Woo says, ``because I'm not good at them. I like to watch
them, but I don't know how to make them. So I said, `If the film is
all about people being human, I'd love to do it.' That's what Tom
wanted, too.''
 &HT;    Which is a good thing, because Cruise is not only one of the top
stars on the planet, but also the producer of ``Mission: Impossible
2.'' Still, Woo says, he never fretted about the risk of losing
control of his film in midstream.
 &HT;    ``I knew Tom respected me a lot,'' he says. ``He wanted to work
with me for a reason. He liked my style, and he wanted me to keep
my style.
 &HT;    ``I never worried about power,'' Woo adds. ``It wasn't in my
mind that Tom was a big star. I knew he was a big star, but when we
talked and worked together, we were like friends. I just wanted to
create a story, make my hero look special and have all the other
characters look perfect.''
 &HT;    ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' Woo devotees will be pleased to
learn, incorporates all of the director's usual stylistic
flourishes.
 &HT;    ``The slow motion, the guy firing two guns, the doves _ I like
the imagery,'' he says. ``In `Mission: Impossible 2' you see a dove
after a door blows off. Tom walks by the door and a white dove
flies across the frame, leading him out.
 &HT;    ``The idea came up on the set,'' the director says. ``I wanted
to use a dove to represent Ethan Hunt _ Ethan is as charming and
pure as a dove. I just wanted to give the character a little more
spirituality and have it be poetic.''
 &HT;    There's a fine line between unifying personal imagery and having
his movies seem like retreads of his earlier work, but Woo doesn't
seem concerned.
 &HT;    ``I don't worry about repeating myself,'' he says. ``I just
shoot the things I like.
 &HT;    ``When I met Tom, he wanted to do something very challenging,''
the director says. ``He told me he'd never fired a gun in his
movies. He also told me how much he liked Bruce Lee. I thought,
`OK, great.' That gave me a lot of inspiration on how to design
great action for Tom. And he did almost every stunt himself.
 &HT;    ``So I don't worry about repeating myself,'' Woo concludes. ``I
just try to use the imagery in a new way.''
 &HT;    Next up is ``Wind Talkers,'' a World War II drama that will
reunite him with ``Face/Off'' star Nicolas Cage. The film concerns
the relationship between two Marines, one white and the other a
Native American.
 &HT;    ``It's based on a true event,'' Woo says excitedly. ``During the
war the Marines used the Navajo language as a code, and the
Japanese couldn't get it.
 &HT;    ``The story is about these men who don't understand each other,
but get to know each other and work together,'' he adds. ``It's a
story about friendship and honor. I'm so glad to be working with
Nic again, and we're about to start the rest of the casting.''
 &HT;    If code-breakers getting to know each other doesn't sound much
like the high-kicking action epics which made Woo famous, well,
that's the whole point. The director, now an American citizen who
resides with his family in Los Angeles, is living his dream and
making the films he wants to make.
 &HT;    ``I still want to do a musical,'' he says. ``I also want to do a
Western. I'd love to do a musical like `Singing in the Rain'
(1952). `West Side Story' (1961) is one of my favorite musicals of
all time.
 &HT;    ``I'm crazy about Westerns, about John Wayne and John Ford, and
Sergio Leone films _ I just want to make one,'' Woo says. ``Another
thing I want to do is make a movie like `Lawrence of Arabia'
(1962), a big epic. That's one of my biggest dreams.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot I want to do,'' he concludes, ``and one of the
great things about being in America is that I'm getting the
chance.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jackie Chan with Owen Wilson in a scene
from ``Shanghai Noon.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Jackie Chan is doing a little redecorating.
 &HT;    He's being interviewed at New York's posh Essex House, but the
furniture layout doesn't meet his standards. So he picks up a heavy
oak chair and moves it _ and the reporter sitting in it _ to a new
spot.
 &HT;    So he's not just strong, he's picky.
 &HT;    ``I like things to be perfect,'' he says.
 &HT;    They aren't far from it, at least where his career is concerned.
The Hong Kong action star has succeeded where so many have failed
in breaking into the American and international markets. After
earning a mere $5 million for the smash hit ``Rush Hour'' (1998),
he's receiving triple that for ``Shanghai Noon,'' a comedy/action
Western set to open May 26.
 &HT;    And the money was apparently well spent _ Disney is so confident
in the film's prospects that a screenwriter is already halfway done
with the sequel.
 &HT;    Being Jackie Chan does have its sore spots _ literally, as he
point out with an informal ``damages tour'' of the impact his
penchant for flamboyant stunts has had on his body.
 &HT;    ``Concussion, bleeding, stitches,'' he says, pointing to his
head.
 &HT;    He touches his nose.
 &HT;    ``Broken three times,'' he says.
 &HT;    Teeth: ``Four gone in bad jump.''
 &HT;    Scalp: ``Ripped open.''
 &HT;    Fingers: ``Sprained, broken, broken, nearly ripped off.''
 &HT;    Shoulder: ``Broken.''
 &HT;    Other shoulder: ``Broken.''
 &HT;    Elbow: ``Broken,'' he says. ``Many times.''
 &HT;    Legs: ``Broken, broken, broken.''
 &HT;    Ribs: ``Cracked. Bruised. Fractured.''
 &HT;    Knees: ``Twisted, broken, crushed.''
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean you should expect to see him taking it easy
in ``Shanghai Noon.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, I do these stunts for one reason,'' he says. ``It's so
much fun. I love it _ I love the challenge!''
 &HT;    Occasionally, he admits, things get out of hand.
 &HT;    ``Well, once I do Hong Kong action movie where I am supposed to
jump from window to tree,'' he recalls. ``It seems easy, but then
the tree branch break and I fall a couple of hundred feet.
 &HT;    ``I got a concussion so bad that the blood was pouring out of my
ear and wouldn't stop for hours,'' Chan says, shrugging. ``No big
deal.''
 &HT;    ``Shanghai Noon,'' based on an idea by Chan, is set in the Old
West, with Chan as a member of the Chinese Imperial Guard who teams
with a roguish train robber (Owen Wilson) to rescue a kidnaped
Chinese princess (Lucy Liu).
 &HT;    ``It's like `The Odd Couple' with horses,'' Chan says.
 &HT;    It's the latest step in an incident-filled life which began in
Hong Kong on April 7, 1954, after what he says was a horrific
11-month pregnancy which ended when his mother delivered a 12-pound
boy via Caesarean section.
 &HT;    The delivery was delayed, he says, because his impoverished
parents couldn't afford the $26 to pay for the surgery.
 &HT;    ``A female doctor approached my father with a deal,'' the actor
says. ``If my father would allow her to adopt me, she would pay for
my mother's surgery and medical expenses.
 &HT;    ``In Hong Kong, poor children were regularly given to their
wealthier friends,'' he adds, ``but my parents always said that
they knew I was a special one. They said no to this doctor, and our
family friends helped them pay the expenses.''
 &HT;    His childhood was spent surrounded by luxury, Chan says, though
his family couldn't share in it.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have much money,'' he says, ``but we lived in a
mansion where my father was a cook and a handyman for the French
ambassador to Hong Kong. My mother worked in the laundry room of
their mansion.
 &HT;    ``I think it taught me humility,'' he concludes, ``and that you
have to work so hard in order to achieve anything in this life.''
 &HT;    His father reinforced that lesson with a strict physical
regimen.
 &HT;    ``He would wake me up at dawn for tough workouts of running,
lifting bags of sand and doing military-style push-ups,'' Chan
recalls. ``We would also spend hours practicing martial-arts moves.
At 5, I learned the basics of Northern-style kung fu.''
 &HT;    The following year, when his parents took jobs in Australia,
Chan stayed behind as a student at the China Drama Academy, where
he spent 10 years as a virtual indentured servant to a famed
martial artist, Yu Jim-yuen.
 &HT;    ``He was a tough master,'' Chan says. ``He gave you food,
protection and the best training in the world, but there was a
steep price.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how I survived,'' he concludes. ``Sometimes I say
`Thank you' to my childhood, because it was the toughest training
of all.
 &HT;    ``I guess I cannot complain,'' he admits. ``Some students at
that school are washing dishes now in China _ they are the ones who
should be complaining. I have it easy.''
 &HT;    His turning point came when, to help the school make ends meet,
its students were given permission to work as film extras. Chan
took to stunt work immediately, and at 17 left school to pursue a
career in films.
 &HT;    ``Being a stunt man made me old before my time,'' he says. ``I
was risking my life for a few dollars a day. But they kept hiring
me. I was called whenever the most dangerous scene needed to be
shot _ I have no fear.''
 &HT;    From stunt work, he moved to acting in low-budget movies, then
higher-budget actioners such as Bruce Lee's ``Fists of Fury''
(1972).
 &HT;    ``They kept calling me the next Bruce Lee,'' Chan recalls, ``but
I didn't like the comparison. He kick high, I kick low. He never
smiles, I like to smile. I didn't want to be Bruce Lee _ I wanted
to be Buster Keaton and Fred Astaire.''
 &HT;    It took a while for American audiences to warm to his unique
combination of comedy and action.
 &HT;    ``Before `Rush Hour' I had many flops in America,'' Chan says.
``I insisted on the scene in `Rush Hour' where I'm hanging from a
street sign on Hollywood Boulevard _ it was my way of saying, `It's
all or nothing this time.'''
 &HT;    ``All'' came out the winner, as the film grossed $160 million
worldwide and jumpstarted his American career. Needless to say, a
sequel is in the works, due in 2001.
 &HT;    Which means more trouble for Chan as he tries to keep up with
his voluble co-star, Chris Tucker.
 &HT;    ``Oh, that guy Chris gave me a lot of problems,'' he says,
laughing. ``First time I meet Chris, he keep talking, talking,
talking. I have to finally say, `Excuse me.' I go to bathroom, call
my manager and say, `He don't shut up! And I don't know what he's
saying. He talks so fast.'''
 &HT;    The sequel will feature that patented Chan action, of course,
though he admits that at 46 his action days are numbered.
 &HT;    ``I think three more years,'' he says thoughtfully. ``Things
hurt now. But the good thing is that these action films are leaving
a good foundation for my next career. When I'm done with action
films, I want to do stuff like Michael Douglas _ I want to do
drama.''
 &HT;    For now, though, he still loves the stunts.
 &HT;    ``I look out a window 20 stories high, I know I can jump out of
it safely,'' he says cheerfully. ``That's because I only jump down
a couple of floors, and then jump to another roof and then jump
onto a ledge and then jump to the ground.
 &HT;    ``Do you think I'm nuts?''

 (Includes a color slide of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Dave Grohl doesn't let his band, Foo Fighters, open for just
anybody.
 &HT;    He was a member of Nirvana, after all, which set standards of
credibility for modern rock bands that have endured since the early
1990s.
 &HT;    But when the Red Hot Chili Peppers invited Foo Fighters to play
several months' worth of dates during this spring and summer, Grohl
didn't hesitate.
 &HT;    ``I can't really think of many other bands that we'd do it
with,'' Grohl says. ``We've been asked by lots of bands to be the
opening band du jour, but it seems like with the Chili Peppers it's
kind of an honor, because they're an institution in their own
right.''
 &HT;    That institution dates back 22 years, since frontman Anthony
Kiedis and bassist Flea _ a.k.a. Michael Balzary _ founded the
Chili Peppers while they were students at Los Angeles' Fairfax High
School.
 &HT;    With carefree irreverence _ including stage appearances naked
except for strategically placed tube socks _ the group has mixed
funk, punk and rock into a distinctive sonic brew that owes props
equally to the MC5, Iggy Pop, the Sex Pistols and George Clinton,
who produced its second album, ``Freaky Styley'' (1985).
 &HT;    It's also been a survival story, with the Chili Peppers carrying
on despite the drug-overdose death of guitarist Hillel Slovak,
other members' addictions _ one of which Kiedis chronicled in their
1992 hit ``Under the Bridge'' _ a stream of eight other musicians
who have joined Kiedis and Flea in the group over the years, and
the distinction of being the band that fiddled while Woodstock 1999
burned.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Kiedis claims that the band never considered
quitting.
 &HT;    ``It never occurred to us not to do this,'' he says. ``At least
not seriously.''
 &HT;    Actually, the Chili Peppers haven't simply survived, they've
thrived. Their latest album, ``Californication'' (1999), is a
multimillion-selling smash that won a Grammy Award and has spun off
the radio hits ``Scar Tissue'' and ``Other Side.''
 &HT;    Drummer Chad Smith calls the new album ``a rebirth'' for the
band. It is their first since ``One Hot Minute'' (1995), which,
despite selling a million copies, was perceived as a disappointment
both creatively and commercially.
 &HT;    Smith credits that rejuvenation to the band's reunion with
guitarist John Frusciante, who was only 18 when he joined the group
in 1988, and was on board for its breakthrough albums ``Mother's
Milk'' (1989) and ``Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``The chemistry with the four of us is the best lineup, I think,
to make Red Hot Chili Peppers music,'' Smith says. ``I was anxious
to see if that would work again. It's really like getting a second
chance. We're all in a really good place. It's exciting again _
we're playing music for fun and enjoying ourselves.''
 &HT;    Frusciante was struggling with a debilitating drug addiction
when he unexpectedly quit in 1992, while the Chili Peppers were
touring in Japan and shortly before they were due to headline that
year's Lollapalooza festival. He tried his hand at a solo career,
but most of his time away from the group was spent either taking
drugs or trying to get off them.
 &HT;    It was Flea who first raised the idea of Frusciante returning to
the band. After visiting him in rehab, he felt that Frusciante was
genuinely clean. The Chili Peppers were without a guitarist, after
the departure of Frusciante's replacement, Dave Navarro of Jane's
Addiction, so he thought the time might be right to bring everybody
back together.
 &HT;    He broached the subject with Kiedis and Smith while the three
were watching a Los Angeles Lakers game on television.
 &HT;    ``He said, `What do you think about bringing John in again?'''
Smith recalls, ``and I was like, `Wow. Really?'
 &HT;    ``Because when he left, it was bad, really bad _ especially
between him and Anthony,'' Smith says. ``They weren't even
talking.''
 &HT;    But it didn't take long for the group to see that Frusciante had
indeed changed course and had rediscovered the passion for music
that had driven his first stint as a Pepper.
 &HT;    ``He was just so happy to be playing, and it's all about the
music and (being) in his favorite band, and it's really like that
again,'' Smith says. ``Now he's really focused, and he's really
inspiring to play with.
 &HT;    ``It's like, we were in the studio all day and all night. Then
he goes home and plays guitar to, like, the Ramones' `Rocket to
Russia,''' the drummer adds. ``He learns every little solo on the
Led Zeppelin BBC record. The next day he'll say `What did you do?'
and I'm like, `I went home and slept, dude.'
 &HT;    ``He's just all about music and art, all day long,'' Smith says.
``That's just what he lives for now.''
 &HT;    With Frusciante back on board, the Peppers repaired to Flea's
garage to jam out the songs for ``Californication.''
 &HT;    ``For our band, it's really important to just get in a room and
make noise and have that spontaneous musical interplay,'' Smith
says.
 &HT;    Co-producer Rick Rubin helped to hone the final list of cuts, as
well as developing the title track and a few others.
 &HT;    ``I think we're getting better at writing songs,'' Smith says.
``It just sounds relaxed. It sounds like how we did it _ we just
got in there and got good performances, like we were really
prepared ... We were happy to be playing together again, and that
probably comes through.''
 &HT;    Smith and the others simply hope the feeling lasts. They've
taken steps to protect it _ most notably reducing the grueling
rigor of their tour schedule, which they believe contributed to
members' drug addictions in the past.
 &HT;    ``With us, it seems like something always happens,'' Smith says
with a laugh, but he quickly adds that he's confident that this
time it will last.
 &HT;    ``When things go well and everyone's in a good mood, and you
make a good record and everybody's digging it, that really makes
things go a lot smoother,'' the drummer says. ``So I think we're
looking forward to some really good times ahead.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every television show needs something unique if it's to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a unique character, such as ``Seinfeld's'' Kramer. It
can be a favorite setting, such as the Central Perk coffee house on
``Friends.'' It can be a unifying story line that people can relate
to, such as ``Frasier's'' search for romance.
</P>
<P>
   But while network writers and producers struggle to find hooks
to keep viewers coming back every week, the World Wrestling
Federation continues to make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, there appears to be no stopping the WWF
juggernaut. It has taken the term ``sports entertainment'' and
turned it into four hours a week of prime-time excitement, 52 weeks
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw Is War'' airs Mondays, originating as a live broadcast on
the USA Network. Week in and week out, ``Raw'' tops the national
cable ratings, and on May 1 it grabbed more than 7 million
households, equivalent to a 9.1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Thursday-night ``Smackdown!'' may have
single-handedly saved UPN. It has become the struggling network's
most-watched program, giving it a stranglehold on the coveted 18-34
male demographic _ particularly impressive, considering that UPN
isn't even available in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pin down the secret to the WWF's success.
Unpredictability and improvisation are two of its strong suits, but
far from the only ones. Recently we sat down with four WWF stars to
discuss some of the keys to their popularity. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; STRONG FEMALES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the WWF has more than its share of
beautiful women, but they definitely don't see themselves as window
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about sex,'' says the single-named Tori, a
member of the infamous D-Generation X crew. ``Any sexual aspect is
good and desirable by the viewers, but it's about being physical as
well. The women are continuing to step up to the plate, and that
was really headed up by Chyna.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women alike are drawn to Chyna, billed as ``The Ninth
Wonder of the World'' and her ability to tackle all obstacles. She
became the first woman to compete in the ``Royal Rumble'' and
``King of the Ring,'' and has even held the Intercontinental Title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that, here in the WWF, you can actually do
it all,'' Tori says.
</P>
<P>
   She rejects criticism from some fans who believe that the WWF's
women are exploited or condescended to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see them tripping on the boy-girl thing,'' she says.
``You know, boys ought not to be hitting girls. But this is
entertainment. It's suspension of disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything Tori wouldn't do in the ring?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a pudding match,'' she says with a smile. ``I
always thought I'd refuse that. Basically, if it's all in the
context of the story line, I don't think anybody would have a
problem with it.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; GETTING PHYSICAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the outcome of the matches is known before the wrestlers
get into the ring. Get over it _ millions of fans have. And however
``fake'' wrestling may be, its physicality is definitely real.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Chris Benoit. Billed as ``The Crippler,'' Benoit is one
of the WWF's most physical wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my character is my aggressiveness and tenacity in the
ring,'' the Canadian-born grappler says. ``But a lot of people
don't realize what goes on outside the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   For Benoit, that means maintaining a rigorous workout regimen,
healthy diet and proper sleep _ despite the WWF's tough travel
schedule, which includes more than 200 live shows every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most sports, we don't get an offseason with three or
four months of recuperation time,'' Benoit says. ``It's a
demanding, year-round, 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered numerous injuries during his 14-year career _
among them a broken ankle and torn elbow ligaments _ but none of
them rivals being knocked unconscious in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst feeling,'' Benoit says. ``You wake up staring
at the lights on the ceiling, hearing people screaming, and you
don't know where you are or what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, he says, he has no regrets about his choice of
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a childhood dream,'' he says. ``We get our bodies
thrown around a lot, and it beats the heck out of our joints _ I
even have a hard time getting out of bed some mornings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is all I've ever wanted to do.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; CHARISMA COUNTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious about the importance of a wrestler's
personality, there's no better person to ask than Chris Jericho.
``Y2J'' is as well known for his humorous ramblings and smart-aleck
remarks as he is for his trademark finishing move, ``The Walls of
Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him one question, and he'll take over the rest of the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   So, Chris, how important is it for a wrestler to have charisma
and personality?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year 2000, I believe that one of the most _ if not the
most _ important thing in the business is to have charisma, a
charismatic character, and to have a persona that entertains
people,'' Jericho says. ``A good character is someone that people
can identify with, attach to and care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sports entertainment,'' he says. ``It's very important
to be a great athlete who can wrestle a tremendous match, but I
think the most important thing is to entertain the people, and to
have the interview skills and the charisma that people can see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I step in the ring, I look at it like one big
party, and I'm the party host,'' Jericho adds. ``It's up to me to
make sure that people have a good time. I'll always do my best to
make sure that happens, and I'll do whatever it takes to get a
reaction from the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make sure that they leave the arena thinking, `I had
a good time, and Chris Jericho was tremendous tonight.''' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; STAR POWER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The WWF has a starmaking machine that rivals old-time Hollywood
at its peak. Sure, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin may be the
top draws, but they're only two of the organization's numerous
stars.
</P>
<P>
   To understand that, simply watch a telecast or attend an event
to see how the crowd reacts when Too Cool starts dancing or when
the entrance music is played for Edge and Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, nobody builds a star better than the WWF,''
Dwayne Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   He should know, because as The Rock he has become one of the
most popular wrestlers ever. He hosted ``Saturday Night Live'' in
March, his book ``The Rock Says'' (Regan Books, 2000) went to No. 1
on the New York Times best-seller list and he recently finished
shooting a role as the Scorpion King in ``The Mummy 2.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists, however, that his success is based less on his
personal appeal than on the WWF's canny shaping of its product to
win over mass audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surrounded by phenomenally gifted athletes and extremely
creative writers,'' Johnson says. ``The WWF is a team effort _ we
all work together in terms of helping each other and complementing
each other's styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ingredients for our recipe for success
here.''

DOOMSDAY, SCHMOOMSDAY. AFTER Y2K, A COSMIC YAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millenarians, mark your calendars. Wednesday, May 17, may be the
last chance for the destruction of planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Y2K was a bust. For all the headaches caused by
computers choking on the double zeros of the new century,
civilization remained stubbornly intact. The millennial leap year
on Feb. 29 was also supposed to create computer havoc. But that too
was a disappointment, as was May 5, when Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn lined up with the moon and sun, promising, for
the scientifically impaired, calamitous gravitational effects on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a
millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may
come this Wednesday, when there will be another planetary
alignment. This time the sun and five planets (but not the moon)
will form an even tighter grouping than they did earlier in the
month.
</P>
<P>
   If anything calamitous does happen, it will not be explainable
by physics. For one thing, these alignments are far from exact:
Next week's is really a clustering within a 19-degree arc of the
sky. But even a perfect alignment would be no cause for alarm.
Gravity weakens so rapidly with distance that the tug exerted on
Earth by all nine planets is vastly less than that of the moon. And
in this month's celestial events, the planets are lining up on the
far side of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the planets on the opposite side of the sun,'' reassured
a NASA Web site (nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/alignment.html),
``the force from each body will actually be at its absolute
minimum.'' And with the sun in the way, astronomers will not even
be treated to a good celestial show.
</P>
<P>
   The real action is not in the sky but on the Internet, where a
smattering of sites are devoted to the astrological, biblical and
monetary possibilities of the nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   A business called the Survival Center has a Web page, ``Earth
Changes Update'' (www.zyz.com/survivalcenter/echange.html), that
warns of earthquakes, tidal waves and winds as intense as 2,000 mph
_ perfect conditions for hawking its supply of gasoline generators,
solar radios and six-day candles. The site also sells a book titled
``5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster,'' in which the author,
Richard Noone, predicted that the alignment would cause the poles
to melt, unleashing a flood of Noachian proportions.
</P>
<P>
   All this may sound familiar to those who remember ``The Jupiter
Effect,'' a 1974 book in which two scientists, John R. Gribbin and
Stephen Plagemann, forecast that a planetary alignment in 1982
would upset the sun, setting off a complex chain of events that
would result in a devastating California earthquake. ``There is no
question about the implication,'' the authors wrote, evoking the
hit tune ``Age of Aquarius'': ``In 1982 `when the Moon is in the
Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars' and with the other
seven planets of the Solar System, Los Angeles will be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was followed by a sequel: ``The Jupiter Effect
Reconsidered.''

THE COSTS OF RAISING A CHILD, THEN AND NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may take a village to raise a child, but a family still ought
to be able to afford one. It now costs about $160,140 to raise a
middle-class child through age 17, according to the Department of
Agriculture's annual report, ``Expenditures on Children by
Families.'' That's up from $25,229 in 1960 and $69,333 in 1980,
seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted for
inflation, would equal $141,998 today, so in fact, the cost of
bringing up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Housing has always been the biggest single expense, these days
making up about a third of the cost of rearing a child, just as it
did 40 years ago. But many other expenditures have changed since
then.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, for example, child care was a tiny subcategory lumped
into overall housing costs. In the 1970s, however, as mothers of
young children poured into the work force, child care expenditures
shot up. By the 1980s, child care and education were given their
own category, which now comprises an average 10 percent of expenses
for preteens. Education costs _ school supplies, books and tuition
_ have risen, too. They now account for 8 percent of family
spending on teen-agers, up from only 2 percent in 1960. A large
proportion of that increase is likely due to spending on private
schools, according to Mark Lino, the Agriculture Department
economist responsible for the report.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs, 4 percent of the total in 1960, are now at 7
percent, having risen sharply in the last 10 years. Food and
clothing, by contrast, haven't fallen as a percentage of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Single-parent families spend about as much on each of their
children as much as two-parent families, by using a greater share
of their income for their children. And across all income strata,
families with a single child lavish about a third more on that
child than families with three or more children spend on each of
theirs. The rich spend about half again as much on food, clothes
and health care than the poor, and more than twice as much on
housing, child care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are highest in in Western cities, lowest in rural areas
and Midwestern cities. And as every parent finds out, older
children cost more than younger ones: child care costs go down, but
not enough to make up for all the extra food, clothes, and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-income baby born last year, incidentally, will have
cost $236,680 by the year 2016, the Department of Agriculture
estimates. But don't worry, that's not adjusted for inflation. Keep
in mind, however, that even after college bills are paid, almost
half of all parents in their fifties are still supporting their
over-21 children.

SITES OFFER PERSONALIZED HELP WITH RETIREMENT PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Online retirement planning isn't just about coming up with some
rough idea of how much you need any more or arriving at some
seemingly unreachable savings figure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can get detailed estimates of your Social Security
benefits based on your age and earnings history, specific advice
for your 401(k) and other retirement accounts, and action steps to
make that apparently unattainable nest egg a reality.
</P>
<P>
   In on the Internet retirement planning action are the Social
Security Administration; mutual fund companies including Vanguard
and Fidelity; financial Web sites such as Microsoft's
MoneyCentral.com and Quicken.com; and a bevy of new online services
_ including one started by a Nobel Prize winning economist _ that
want to sell you specific 401(k) advice.
</P>
<P>
   Various national surveys have found Americans lagging in saving
and investing for retirement:
</P>
<P>
   --Fewer than half of US households will have built a big enough
retirement nest egg, according to a study last month by the
Consumer Federation of America and DirectAdvice.com, which sells
401(k) and other financial advice.

   --Only 16 percent of American workers have saved $100,000 or
more for retirement, and only half have ever tried to figure out
how much they'll need to retire, according to a 1999 retirement
confidence survey by the American Savings Education Council (ASEC),
Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), and Matthew Greenwald
and Associates. The 2000 survey will be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With such dismal findings, proponents of retirement saving urge
people to take advantage of the plentiful online tools out there.
</P>
<P>
   Even the very act of coming up with a rough idea of how much
you'll need in retirement, using something such as ASEC's simple
online ``ballpark estimate'' worksheet, can make all the
difference, said Dallas Salisbury, chairman of ASEC and president
of EBRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the shock factor. At the point people do an initial
assessment, the number does hit you as to what you need to save. It
creates, if you will, an incentive to act,'' said Salisbury, whose
savings education council is a coalition of US government agencies,
corporations, and nonprofits such as EBRI.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have found Americans who have done a retirement
calculation have a median of $66,500 saved up, compared with only
$14,000 for those who haven't put pencil to paper or used one of
the online retirement calculators out there, according to the
savings council.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the Web sites offering retirement planning
tools, from the most basic to the most sophisticated:
</P>
<P>
   --www.ssa.gov: Last month, President Clinton unveiled the Social
Security Administration's new online ``retirement planner,'' which
gives people three options for estimating their benefits. The
simplest is an interactive ``quick calculator,'' based on what you
put in for current age and earnings. Then there's another online
calculator based on your entire earnings history. Finally, you can
download software to get the most detailed analysis. The last two
options, currently not available in a Macintosh version, require
you to enter past earnings.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a copy of your Social Security Statement with
your earnings history, you can order one online. The Web site also
shows what age you can expect to get full benefits (increasing to
67 for people born in 1960 and later), and how much your benefits
would be reduced if you retired early, at 62.
</P>
<P>
   --www.asec.org: At this site by the American Savings Education
Council, you can fill in a ``ballpark estimate'' worksheet, which
lets you roughly figure out the annual income you'll need in
retirement; what you can expect to get from Social Security, your
employer's traditional pension, and part-time income; and how much
you'll need to make up in savings. The site also features an
interactive quiz to figure out your retirement personality _
whether you're a planner, saver, struggler, the impulsive type, or
a deny-er. And there's a quiz to assess your retirement readiness.
</P>
<P>
   --www.financialengines.com: Co-founded by William F. Sharpe,
winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize in economics, this Internet
financial adviser provides for free a personal retirement forecast
based on your specific 401(k) investments and contributions, but
charges individuals $54.95 to $189.95 a year for buy-and-sell
advice, depending on the level of service selected and number of
retirement accounts. The company also sells its services to
employers who want to help workers maximize their 401(k) plan.
``We're very different from some other sites,'' said Sharpe, a
Stanford professor emeritus. ``We take risk into account. We don't
ask you what you think your return is going to be. We use very
carefully constructed estimates and we will predict the range of
outcomes you'll experience.'' One of the neatest features of the
free forecast: Watching the graphing of the various retirement
scenarios on a chart and a bottom-line conclusion about the
probability of your plan succeeding, which gets depicted like a
weather forecast _ sunny or gloomy. The drawback: The site makes
recommendations only on mutual funds in your 401(k), IRA, or other
tax-deferred accounts, and not for other assets.
</P>
<P>
   --www.DirectAdvice.com: For $75 a year, this Hartford,
Conn.-based online investment adviser makes recommendations not
only for saving for retirement, but also for your children's
college education, a new home, or a dream vacation. That annual fee
lets you run as many different investment plans as you'd like. The
drawback is that there's no free trial of any of its features, only
a ``learn more'' section of static (not interactive) screens. Thus,
you get a snapshot of a generic plan for someone named John _ who
is planning for retirement, a downpayment for a house, and college
expenses _ but nothing individualized. A trial is available to the
media, however, and this reviewer found that users of the service
have to put in a lot of information and make some economic
assumptions. But the 19-page plan that resulted during this review
included a lot of detailed information, including specific action
steps and asset-allocation recommendations, although some of the
advice appeared to be cookie-cutter.
</P>
<P>
   --www.TeamVest.com and www.Quicken.com: These two companies have
teamed up to provide what they call the only free online 401(k)
investment advice service, giving you recommendations for
allocating your assets based on the mutual funds your company plan
offers, if the plan happens to be in TeamVest's database. Quicken
refers visitors over to the TeamVest site for the new 401(k)
service, but TeamVest's site won't be updated until the summer, and
there's currently difficulty printing from it. However, you can
still input your personal information, salary, risk tolerance,
retirement income needs, economic assumptions, and other data and
get an action plan and a report that are supposed to be printable,
but weren't at the time of this review. One neat feature: If you
type in your employer and it's in the 401(k) database, the service
will automatically let you know what options you have in your
company plan. Otherwise, it'll give you generic asset allocation
recommendations. TeamVest also offers more detailed 401(k) advice
for a charge: A one-time, personalized report for $49.95, or a
full-service option for between $89.95 to $149.95 a quarter.

ROYAL FASCINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A tiara exhibit is ridiculous. It is also stunningly
irresistible, which explains the crowds filing into the darkened
room full of jeweled head pieces at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston since March 1.
</P>
<P>
   People laugh, sure. They make smart remarks: ``Wouldn't wear
that to the grocery store.'' Or ``Not with tennis shoes. I don't
think so.'' Or the all-encompassing, ``UnbeLIEVable.''
</P>
<P>
   They stand in jeans, sweatshirts and modern sensibilities,
feeling superior at first because, after all, they are Americans,
surrounded by the twinkling grandeur of mostly dead or irrelevant
European and Russian aristocracies. They are enlightened voyeurs
peering into the avaricious past and the raging ego of Napoleon,
who wanted the ladies of his court to dazzle the world with their
diamonds even as he made it tremble with his military might.
</P>
<P>
   Look at poor Empress Marie Louise, posing for her portrait with
that load of rocks pressing into her forehead. Even the names of
the stones sound heavy _ the diamond of the King of Sardinia, the
Mazarin VIII, the Grand Mazarin, the Fleur de Pecher.
</P>
<P>
   Who could wear a Valkyrie Wing Tiara with a straight face, even
if Wagner nights at the Paris and London operas demanded it? And
those intricately designed pieces crafted into garlands, wheat
shafts, autumn leaves _ and an owl, yet, gripping a branch with its
claws, wings spread wide, surely got somebody giggling at the
party, especially after a few glasses of bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a person lingers, face reflected in the glass, wondering
how the thing would look, how the Londonderry Tiara's 1,141
diamonds would feel, all in one place, above the eyebrows, or
simply held in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are wearing important jewelry it gives you the
feeling that you can go out and conquer the world,'' says exhibit
curator Diana Scarisbrick, a British art historian who specializes
in jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote hundreds of letters to private collectors, museums,
and jewelry houses to bring the 80 pieces to Boston. Her inquiries
got some stiff responses: ``Send my mother's tiara to Boston! Are
you mad?''
</P>
<P>
   We are still a rambunctious colony in some minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tiara symbolizes royalty, grandeur, rank. It has nothing
to do with today's casual attitudes. It's amazing to me that the
people of Boston are so fascinated with the exhibit,'' says
Scarisbrick.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80,000 people have visited ``Crowning Glories,'' which
will be up until June 25 and will not go on tour. The allure is not
only the jewels but the prestige. Bostonians, and most Americans,
are fascinated with royalty _ maybe because they were once subjects
of the crown, or maybe just because they are human beings, ever
curious about their presumed ``betters.''
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of viewers is thick around a garland-style tiara
similar to the one Princess Diana wore when she married Prince
Charles. There is no photograph of her. This is not her tiara. Her
name printed on a card is enough to draw a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Grace is another magnet, and so is Rose Kennedy, who
borrowed a tiara from the Countess of Bessborough when the Kennedys
were presented at court in 1938. Political and Hollywood royalty
still rule here.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the museum gift shop the imitation tiaras sell briskly
for as little as $8. Young girls and their mothers plunk them on
their heads, looking like fairy princesses at a Halloween ball.
Shop clerks wear them, too. It's as if they had all received those
coveted invitations of long ago, embossed with the directive:
``Tiaras will be worn.''
</P>
<P>
   The shop is full of modern-day status symbols _ bracelets,
including one priced at $7,000; pendants, earrings, plates, tea
kettles, and scarves designed to tell the world that the owner has
class.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of avarice and ego in America 2000. Perhaps
some future exhibit will display it _ Rolex watches, Armani suits,
Italian leather, Porsches and BMWs, gold bathroom fixtures,
silk-threaded wallpaper, designer coffee, and imported truffles.
Viewers might laugh, too, and make a few condescending cracks about
what past generations held dear. Diamond ankle bracelets, Gucci
bags, and granite kitchen counter tops _ UnbeLIEVable.

LEGEND SIDES WITH SUSPECTS IN ESTONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia _ To the police, the Voitka brothers are pretty
much run-of-the-mill robbery suspects. But for much of the public
and some media here, the two siblings have become folk heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Aivar and Ulo Voitka had evaded the law for 15 years, by hiding
in Estonia's thick, dark forests. Police arrested them in February,
after a six-hour siege at a deserted farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Voitkas, who are awaiting trial, have captured the public
imagination. Many here associate them with Estonia's ``Forest
Brothers,'' partisans who in the 1940s escaped to the forest to
fight Josef Stalin's occupying Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   Like the real Forest Brothers, the Voitka brothers originally
went underground to resist the Soviet authorities, who ruled
Estonia until 1991. They took refuge in the forest in 1986, when
they were teenagers, to avoid being drafted into the hated Soviet
Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Aivar, now 32, and Ulo, 31, stayed in the woods long after
the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, and Estonia regained its
independence.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the two have been wanted by Estonia's police in
connection with a series of store robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after their capture, the press took up the fugitives'
cause, and they became almost mythical figures.
</P>
<P>
   One rock band recently released an album titled ``The Voitka
Brothers' Forest Songs,'' singing the praises of the two men. And
one bakery said it plans to market a special bread honoring the
brothers, with their faces on the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become like the legend of Jesse James in America,''
said Mart Laar, Estonia's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running Estonia's government, Laar, 40, is
considered one of the country's foremost experts on the Forest
Brothers. A historian, Laar has written a book about the
anti-Soviet resistance movement titled ``The War in the Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Army occupied Estonia, along with Latvia and
Lithuania, in the 1940s, tens of thousands of people fled to the
dense forests to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Some were escaping arrest and deportation. Others formed an
organized armed resistance movement and engaged the Russians in
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forest Brothers considered it their duty to uphold the
nation's spirit of resistance while demoralizing and intimidating
the Soviet authorities,'' Laar wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They blew up newly erected Soviet monuments. And, in defiance of
a Soviet ban on Estonian national symbols, they flew the country's
blue, black, and white flag from tall trees and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   They also ambushed army patrols, wrecked power lines, and
assassinated local Communist Party leaders. Moscow, meanwhile waged
a war to wipe out the guerrillas, a conflict that historians
estimate claimed about 50,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   And although Soviet forces by the early 1950s had neutralized
the resistance, the last Estonian forest brother was not captured
until 1978, eight years before the Voitka brothers took refuge in
the forest.

COUPLE SHOULD BE IN FINE SHAPE FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We do not plan to add money to the taxable accounts, but will
reinvest all dividends until 2011. We will each add $2,000 a year
to the IRA accounts, and add $35,000 a year to the 401(k) plan.
What is the likelihood of reaching our income goal by 2011, and
continuing that income stream at an inflation-adjusted level in the
years beyond that? Are we aiming too high? Would you change the
portfolio mix? We have no heirs to preserve capital for.
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Sharon, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you should be in excellent shape. If your overall
portfolio produces average annual returns of 9 percent for the next
11 years, and if you add $7,500 a year to your tax-deferred
savings, you will accumulate $1,168,209.
</P>
<P>
   If your plan is to build the fixed-income side of your portfolio
to provide your $40,000 income, you would need $615,000 in that
account, leaving you with a little more than $550,000 which you
could leave in stock investments to protect yourself from future
inflation. Especially since you will have that $10,000 annual
pension income coming in after five years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The main question I have is whether you have thought about the
inflation which is likely to come between now and the time you
retire. If inflation averages 3.5 percent, by the year 2011, it
will take $58,398 to buy what $40,000 buys today. Thus you would
need a fixed-income portfolio of a little less than $900,000 to
supply the desired income stream. Both that calculation and the
preceding one presumes a 6.5 percent yield from the fixed-income
holdings. That would not be as comfortable, cutting your stock
portfolio to a little more than $268,000. But again, given the
effective raise you will get when the pensions begin, you should be
in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My mother, a long-time widow and retired school teacher, has
asked me for investment advice. She has handled her own affairs and
done quite well but is now 87 and feels a change may be needed. She
has income of $51,088 from sources other than her investments, owns
her own home and lives simply. She has an arrangement where she is
guaranteed entry in a retirement center at any time she might chose
to do so. I am concerned she is getting too much income and thus is
paying too much income tax. I am thinking she should move money to
stocks or stock funds that will increase in value but not provide
much income. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A. P., Austin, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're in a sort of ticklish situation is what I think. Yes,
its true your mother certainly has a lot more of her assets in
bonds and other fixed-income holdings than she needs to have, since
she has other sources which fully cover her income needs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more reasons than an income stream for holding
bonds, and one of them is that over the long term they are safer
than stocks. They suffer jolting reverses when interest rates rise,
but they tend to recover once interest rates reverse, and they
inevitably do. So while this portfolio is similar to that of many
people your mother's age, it seems likely to me that this was
designed as it has been as a means of holding down risk rather than
providing an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that you must do in advising your mother is to
make sure that you do not suggest moves which will make her
uncomfortable. My mother is the same age as yours _ and she can
remember the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression
that followed quite vividly. So she might not be comfortable with
the moves you are suggesting.
</P>
<P>
   The second point that I would make is delicate. Presumably you
will at some point be an heir to her estate. People inheriting
stock enjoy the step-up rule when it comes to the base cost of the
stocks inherited. It seems to me that if you suggest moving large
portions of the portfolio to stocks that you may be open to an
accusation of supplying self-serving advice.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I suggest that you have your mother seek out a
financial adviser or an attorney who would, on a purely fee basis,
establish a strategy for handling her investments. Once the
strategy is clearly established and the market allocations set down
in writing, you could again step into the picture to carry out the
specifics of the broad plan that she has outlined. The cost of
obtaining such advice should not be high relative to the total
portfolio, and the peace of mind it should afford both of you would
probably be great. And don't be surprised if you find out that the
portfolio is the way it is because thats the way she wants it.
Portfolios rarely obtain their character by accident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for a safe investment for the money I recently
received from the sale of my home. I am in a retirement home which
costs $2,250 a month. I get $1,100 a month from Social Security,
and will need to draw $3,000 a month from my savings. Will my money
see me through? I have no debts.
</P>
<P>
   D.W., San Marcos, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you should be in good shape if you put the proceeds
from your home sale in more CDs _ although you should shop for the
CDs carefully. Entering this week the nation's highest rate for a
five-year CD of $100,000 or more was 7.72 percent. The highest rate
for CDs under $100,000 was 7.70 percent. In contrast, the national
average rate for five-year CDs of $100,000 or more was 6.28
percent, and the under $100,000 was 6.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To assure your CD savings will be fully insured by the FDIC, I
suggest you go with a $100,000 CD at one institution, and a $56,000
CD at a different institution.
</P>
<P>
   Will your money last you out? It should. If you achieved a
portfolio average of 6.5 percent, you could withdraw at a rate of
$3,000 a month for more than 20 years before depleting the savings
pool.

CONDO OWNERS FRONT-LOAD AND CENTER IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Neptune facts box text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peg Fuller has hit the wash-and-wear jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   She and every other condominium owner at Summit Terrace in
Reading, Mass. are going to get new, high-tech, front-loading
washers and dryers worth about $2,000 from Maytag in return for
participating in a US Department of Energy water and energy
conservation study this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of real-life test the government and manufacturers
should do more often. Not only will it show whether so-called
front-loading washers live up to their promise, but it should help
consumers decide whether spending two to four times more for a
washer and dryer will really pay off down the road in energy and
water savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show there are two price tags for an
appliance,'' said Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary of energy.
``There's what you pay at the store and there's what you pay to
operate it. And what you pay to operate it is far, far greater.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. But it's often hard to look 10 years down the road
when you're spending $2,000 right now. ``That's a lot of money,''
Fuller said. ``At my age'' _ 68 _ ``it would outlast me. For a
family with children, it might be worth the expense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maytag Neptune washer that's at the heart of the Reading
experiment borrows heavily from front-loading technology that's
been around for years in Europe but is only slowly gaining
acceptance here. Front-loading washers are everywhere in Europe but
represent only about 3.5 percent of the US market.
</P>
<P>
   Front-loading washers look much like dryers, but instead of a
tumble-dry system they use a tumble-wash system. The system
requires less than two-thirds of the water needed in a top-loading
washer and, because there's less water, less energy is needed to
heat the water.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the agitator that's found in the center of
top-loading washers also has benefits. Clothes don't get pummeled
and tend to last longer. And the spin cycle can run at 1,000
revolutions per minute rather than 500, which means more water is
wrung out and drying time is shortened. On paper, at least, the
only negatives with front-loaders is that it's hard to let clothes
soak and difficult to throw a sock in once the wash cycle has
started.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag and the DOE ran their first test of front-loading washers
in the rural town of Bern, Kansas, in 1997. The water and energy
usage of 100 residents was tracked before and after new Maytag
front-loaders were installed. The results: water savings of 38
percent and energy savings of 56 percent. Officials estimated if 20
percent of US households used those washers, the country would save
26 billion gallons of drinking water a year and enough energy to
heat 800,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Strathman, one of the lucky residents of Bern
(population 200), said she was skeptical that her family's dirty
clothes would get clean using half as much water. She has three
sons and a husband who is a welder.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it really does work,'' she said, adding that clothes come
out of the washer's spin cycle almost dry. She said she has
persuaded her aunt and other friends to buy Neptunes, despite their
high price. ``They pay for themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bern, Reading has a problem with water. The typical Reading
family pays a water and sewer bill of $1,045 a year, the
fifth-highest among communities served by the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority and four times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   DOE officials plan to start tracking the current water and
energy usage of the 66 condo owners in June. In August, Fuller's
14-year-old Maytag washer and dryer (never serviced once, she
notes) will be given to charity and replaced with Maytag's Neptune
Navigator washer and dryer. Two months later we'll know how much
energy and water they save.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, started making its Neptune line
of front-loading washers in 1997. It has sold close to a million of
them by now, but that's still a tiny fraction of the market. Maytag
officials aren't complaining. The company reportedly makes enormous
profit margins on the Neptunes, four to five times what it does on
its regular washers and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   The souped-up Navigators that Fuller and her fellow condo owners
in Reading will get aren't even on the market yet, although Fuller
said officials told her they will retail later this summer for
about $2,000. That's up about $500 from the current Neptune
washer-dryer price.
</P>
<P>
   For people like me (I've ruined so many clothes my wife won't
let me near the family wash), the Navigator seems great. It's so
big you can wash eight king-size sheets at once, you can customize
washing cycles for individual family members, and there's a ``stain
brain'' that tells you what type of wash cycle works best for the
55 most common stains.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new bells and whistles are not likely to
increase the energy and water savings. The Navigator washer uses
the same amount of water and spins faster (1,000 rpms vs. 800) than
the old Neptune, but energy savings probably won't increase because
the new Navigator has an on-board heater to make sure the water
reaches the proper temperature. Apparently, hot water heaters can't
be trusted, but that's another story.

   Fleet credit card fees
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial Corp. is imposing a $35 annual credit card
fee on customers who use their cards infrequently or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment it looked like FleetBoston was trying to slap fees
on customers who pay off their balances each month, but after some
initial bobbing and weaving Fleet officials insisted they are
merely trying to cover their costs in dealing with customers who
make few transactions with their cards.
</P>
<P>
   Citing rising interest rates, Fleet recently hiked the fixed
rates of many of its cardholders an average of 2.5 percentage
points. Several customers called me afterward to say they were
being allowed to keep their fixed rate but would have to pay a $35
annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't making any money on me. That's why they imposed
the annual fee on me,'' said Marianne Stephenson of Danvers, who
said she hasn't used the Fleet card much and never carries a
balance. Stephenson said she immediately canceled her card.
</P>
<P>
   Banks in the late 1990s tried to impose annual fees on customers
who didn't carry a balance and didn't incur interest charges, but
Joseph Saunders, chief executive of FleetBoston's credit card
business, said that isn't the case here.
</P>
<P>
   He said FleetBoston can make a decent profit on customers who
don't carry a balance as long as they use their card to make a
healthy number of transactions. But he said the bank loses money on
customers who just keep the card as a backup or rarely use it. The
new annual fee is meant to cover the bank's costs in dealing with
those customers, he said.

   MediaOne expands bundling
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to corral more of its customers' dollars, MediaOne this
week begins packaging basic levels of digital cable television,
local phone service, and high-speed Internet access for $100 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   That's a savings of nearly $27 a month over the standalone
prices of each service. Or you can look at it as getting free local
phone service if you buy all three. You can knock another $10 off
the package price if you buy your own cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   But keep in mind the price will go up if you want more than
basic service. For example, a calling area beyond your home town
and adjacent communities will cost more _ $12.95 extra for
metropolitan service and $22.95 extra for unlimited calling in all
four Eastern Massachusetts area codes. If you want more than the
175 channels included with digital cable, you also have to pay
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Bundling is likely to expand even more in the future as AT&AMP;T
completes its acquisition of MediaOne and adds long-distance phone,
wireless, and other services to the mix.

FRONT-LOADER FACTS &QL; 
 &QL; 
Maytag's Neptune line of front-loader washers cost $1,000 and up
but offer significant savings on water and energy and reportedly
clean clothes better. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Water - A load of laundry requires 23 gallons of water, as opposed
to 40 gallons with a top-loading washer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Energy - Because less water is used, there is less water to heat.
The spin cycle of 800 revolutions per minute (1,000 rpms in the new
Neptune Navigator) also wrings more water out of clothes and saves
on drying time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cleaning - Agitators in top-loading washers increase wear and tear
on clothes. In front-loaders, clothes are tumble washed much like a
dryer. Maytag says the system extends the life of clothes, results
in less bunching and removes stains better. &QL; 
 &QL; 
High-tech - The new Neptune Navigator comes with on-board heater to
insure accurate water temperatures, offers tips on how best to
remove up to 55 stains and allows users to customize 24 different
wash cycles. &QL;

   --Healthy. The cardinals were shocked when Albino Luciani, who
in 1978 became Pope John Paul I, died after just 33 days in office.
The papacy is an increasingly taxing job, and the cardinals are
expected to demand a certain level of vigor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ciro Benedettini, a Vatican spokesman, said it would be
inappropriate to comment on the topic of papal succession while
there is still an active pope in the chair of St. Peter. But
experts in Italy and the United States interviewed for this story
generally agreed that the world's cardinals, in their own unique
way, are already politicking, trying to demonstrate to one another
their intellectual heft, knowledge of world affairs, and an ability
to communicate through public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates most often mentioned as possible successors
are Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria, the president of the
pontifical council for interreligious dialogue, and Cardinal Carlo
Maria Martini of Italy, the archbishop of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Arinze would be the first black pope in modern times; there is
some debate over the race of Gelasius I, an African who was pope
from 492 to 496. Although he is from Africa, he is also a Vatican
insider. He would be a powerful choice symbolically, not only
because he is black but also because he is from the southern
hemisphere, but at age 67, he may be too young.
</P>
<P>
   Martini would be the first Jesuit pope, making him a favorite of
many American Catholic intellectuals, and he is a highly regarded,
frequently published scholar of scripture and spirituality.
However, he is viewed as too liberal by some.
</P>
<P>
   Other oft-mentioned candidates include Cardinal Lucas Moreira
Neves of Brazil, another Vatican insider from the southern
hemisphere, but a man who is in ill health; Cardinal Dionigi
Tettamanzi of Genoa, who, at age 65, is considered young but is
popular among cardinals and considered a possible compromise
candidate, Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, a moderate who is prefect
of the Vatican's Congregation for Oriental Churches.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is possible the next pope is not even a cardinal yet
_ Giacomo della Chiesa had been a cardinal for just four months
when he was elected Pope Benedict XV in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to weigh what to look for from the next pope
without considering the strengths and weaknesses of the current
pope. Numerous scholars said John Paul II will be remembered for
his successes at outreach to other religions and to the farthest
geographic corners of the church, but also for his intolerance of
liberal thinking and dissent within the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the world he's been a marvelous pope, but for the church
his legacy is going to be more problematic, because there's a good
deal of division now within the Catholic community,'' said Thomas
Groome, a Boston College theologian. ``The cardinals are astute
observers of the mood of the church, and I don't think we're going
to get a right-wing ideologue. Their own love for the church and
the tradition would signal that we need somebody who can sweep a
broad swath of inclusion down the mainstream of Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, scholars say, the shortage of priests will
force a debate about priestly celibacy and the ordination of women,
although change on either front is unlikely soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of aspects to this pope's pontificate have to be
continued, such as outreach to other religions and other
Christians, concern about the Third World, and outreach to the
poor,'' McBrien said. ``But the more challenging things will be
internal: how to restore a greater sense of unity, raise the morale
of those committed to working for the church on a full-time basis .
. . and limit the powers of the Roman curia. The ancient title of
pontiff means supreme bridge maker, and the pope has to be someone
who tries to reach out to all sides.''

WHO KILLED THE MASSACHUSETTS GOP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Kennedy is running for his sixth full term in the US Party
(itals)does(unitals) have a candidate for the US Senate. Senate and
for the first time ever, it seems he will not have a Republican
opponent. Barring a miracle, the ill-starred campaign of Jack E.
Robinson _ badly weakened by a series of revelations about his past
_ will not qualify for the state ballot in November. This is widely
seen as a humiliating sign of the GOP's weakness in Massachusetts.
But it doesn't begin to convey just how completely the party has
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts sends 12 men to Congress; every one is a Democrat.
Of the 40 state senators, only seven are Republicans. Of the 160
state representatives, Republicans account for just 27. Governor
Paul Cellucci is a Republican, but his party lacks the votes to
sustain a gubernatorial veto, or even to force a roll call on
controversial votes. A mere 13 percent of Massachusetts voters are
Republicans _ a fraction that hasn't budged in years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 special elections held to fill legislative vacancies
since Cellucci came to office, Democrats have won 10. The
governor's coattails have proved nonexistent; Democratic incumbents
he has gone out of his way to defeat have been reelected easily.
Even among Republicans, his influence is minimal. In the
presidential primary earlier this year, he pulled out all the stops
for George W. Bush. John McCain won in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only Kennedy who will get a free pass from the GOP this
fall. At least five, and as many as nine Bay State congressmen will
face no credible challenger. In the Legislature, 25 Democratic
senators and 90 representatives will run unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the scandals: The massive cost overrun on
Boston's Big Dig, already the most expensive highway project in the
nation. The ``booze cruise'' on a state-chartered boat that ended
up costing the Republican director of the Massachusetts Port
Authority his job. The swirl of ethics flaps involving Lieutenant
Governor Jane Swift _ from the use of state workers as baby-sitters
to a highly irregular sinecure at Suffolk University. The discovery
that $10 million was embezzled from the state Treasury on the watch
of the former treasurer, Republican Joe Malone. The drunk-driving
arrest of Sandy Tennant, a lobbyist and former director of the
state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts GOP is a laughingstock. And the fault can be
laid squarely at the feet of Cellucci and his predecessor, former
Governor Bill Weld. It is hard to remember now, but when they came
to office in January 1991, the party was in pretty decent shape. It
had a professional staff, an aggressive fundraising operation, and
a busy farm team. But Weld and then-Lieutenant Governor Cellucci
purposely allowed it to fall into disrepair. Candidate recruitment
stopped. Grass-roots party-building dried up. The aggressive
fund-raising went on, but most of the money was now siphoned to the
Weld-Cellucci campaign account; little found its way to GOP
hopefuls in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting the Democrats, Weld and Cellucci went out of
their way to appease them. Weld campaigned with Bill Bulger, the
very partisan Democratic Senate president who had long been
anathema to GOP regulars. Cellucci attended fund-raisers for
Democratic incumbents. And rather than use their patronage power to
give experience and exposure to up-and-coming Republicans, both
made it a point to choose Democrats for key government posts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cellucci's new secretary of administration and
finance _ the so-called ``deputy governor'' _ donated thousands of
dollars to the state's top Democratic candidates in 1998. The
governor's environmental affairs secretary was the Democratic whip
in the state Senate. Cellucci yanked a longtime Republican activist
from the Boston Licensing Board and replaced her with a
high-profile Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the Massachusetts GOP stopped distinguishing
itself from the Democrats on matters of principle. From gun control
to abortion rights to the minimum wage, Weld and Cellucci routinely
made common cause with the Democrats. With their encouragement,
government spending ballooned. The state budget has swelled to $22
billion, nearly 70 percent higher than any budget Michael Dukakis
ever signed. As far back as 1992 _ just one year after taking
office _ Weld was trumpeting his support for enlarging the state.
``We're not against government spending,'' he said. ``We don't wish
to dismantle government.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican Party is near death in Massachusetts, it is
because it no longer stands for much of anything. By bending over
backward to accommodate Democrats, the GOP sent voters a
crystal-clear message: You don't need us. Result? A power structure
nearly wiped clean of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there is a silver lining for voters who want a party
that will fight for smaller government, lower taxes, and great
individual freedom. Unlike the Republicans, the Libertarian Party
(itals)does(unitals) have a candidate for the US Senate. On May 9,
Carla Howell filed nearly 33,500 signatures, far more than the
number needed to qualify for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is too big, too costly, too sloppy, too
nosy, and too bossy,'' Howell says. Republican candidates in
Massachusetts used to talk that way. The fact that most of them no
longer do helps explain why the Massachusetts Republican Party has
nearly gone out of business.

GIULIANI'S SELF-MADE MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The fact that public officials have a right to a
private life has nothing to do with a public official who calls a
press conference to dump his wife simply because he thinks
(incorrectly) that she is about to call a press conference to dump
him for his public indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   That one can get that morsel from friends of Rudy Giuliani or
his wife is an indication of how little the New York mayor's
tribulations involve truly private matters and how much they relate
to his public persona.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical effort to apply logic to this mess, former Governor
Mario Cuomo argued that the mayor couldn't possibly be intending to
get out of his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the US
Senate. After all, a pol intending to quit a race would hardly make
public an embarrassing situation that might remain less public in
the aftermath of a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But logic is often of no use where the foibles of humans are
concerned. The Giuliani imbroglio has nothing to do with logic and
everything to do with a life that has spun out of control at the
direct expense of supporters and allies, and ultimately of the
public from which he seeks a mandate for a new office. It's classic
Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thought missing from the mayor's musings last week was
any consideration of the public. Instead, every thought expressed
was about himself _ his ordeal, his indecision, his feelings. One
gets used to rampant egomania in public life, but the politician
who continuously communicates the notions that the campaign is all
about him instead of the public is beyond myopic.
</P>
<P>
   On an impulse last summer, I bet a hundred bucks that Giuliani
would not be the GOP nominee for the Senate by the time the formal
choice was made this month. Witnesses thought I deserved odds, but
I went straight up for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first was my judgment after watching this weird bully for
years that he was by nature a lord-it-over-everybody kind of guy _
in pig heaven as mayor _ and utterly incapable of committing
himself to run for an office where getting along with others is
everything. The second was a feeling that like most bullies, the
mayor could not handle a tough challenge, and that once Mrs.
Clinton's rookie goofs had faded, her candidacy would pose the
toughest of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   I still could lose my bet, but now that the odds are 50-50 at
best, the last few days of nonstop soap opera have made me more
confident of the primacy of my reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the prostate cancer. It's not the public mess of his
marriage. It's not his crass, calculated and cruel public treatment
of his wife. It's not what he and she have said about other women.
It's not even his martinet-style of disparagement of all who would
dare criticize. And it's not even his crude disregard for the civil
rights of ordinary citizens, particularly people of color who are
accosted by the occasional out-of-control police officer. The ranks
of political leaders are filled with people with health, personal,
and personality problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's everything, a final feather on the scale that tips it over
to a judgment that the mayor's life is too full of turmoil to leave
room for diligent public service in Washington.Once you get past
the tabloid sleaze and even the feelings of many that perhaps there
is some justice in the world, what Giuliani has done is instructed
us in the true meaning of the term private life, and its actual
relation to what we call a public life.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of public figures should include private zones, but
the absence of accepted definition has producedinformational
anarchy in our ``anything goes'' culture. The best anybody can come
up with is the notion that while private zones must exist, there
can be moments when private behavior affects public performance
directly and obviously.
</P>
<P>
   The best statement of this came nearly a decade ago from Senator
Edward Kennedy, whose life had been full of publicized turmoil. At
some point, he said that day, the accumulation of private behavior
just becomes too much to keep from affecting public performance or
at least one's reputation in the public arena. He acknowledged that
moment had come in his life, uttered the equivalent of a never
again pledge, and proceeded to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Kennedy's statement was his understanding that
citizens who have no voice and no power are counting on him to
speak and work for them, and that by definition requires a focused
life. Since one should assume that voters don't elect New York
senators solely for their entertainment value, the same goes for
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The point extends to politics. Conservatives place great weight
on defeating Mrs. Clinton, and not solely for hateful personal
reasons. Giuliani has drained some $20 million in campaign cash
from a national GOP effort that needs every dime. He has already
let a great many people down. To the extent that he deserves
sympathy, it is for his public display of an obviously messed-up
person. But the sympathy must include an insistence that he put his
life in order immediately. If he can't get his act together, the
least he can do is not take it on the road.

AS JOHN PAUL NEARS 80, CHURCH WEIGHS QUESTION OF SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JEFF ISRAELY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images of frailty are unavoidable: the elderly pontiff
nodding off at a Mass in Bethlehem, stumbling and cutting his head
in Warsaw, relying on a cart with wheels to traverse St. Peter's
Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   The once vigorous man who slipped away from the Vatican for
skiing holidays now physically trembles and slurs his speech,
apparent side effects of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Pope John Paul II's physical weakness seems to have
endeared him to the public _ the photographs of the frail old man
praying alone before the Western Wall in Jerusalem, shuffling
painfully across the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial seemed to serve
as powerful images of spiritual intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But as John Paul approaches his 80th birthday on Thursday,
Catholics have quietly begun to consider the inevitable moment when
John Paul's death or, less likely, retirement will create an
opening for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is the world's most visible and influential religious
figure, considered by observant Catholics to be infallible when
speaking on faith and morals. Not only is he the spiritual leader
of the largest branch of Christianity _ there are an estimated 1
billion Catholics _ but he also commands unrivaled access to the
media and to world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has used his pulpit to speak out on a variety of
economic and social policies, from his lifelong fight against
communism to his ardent opposition to abortion and capital
punishment. The results have been mixed, but his moral suasion was
cited by the White House when explaining its support for
international debt relief and by the governor of Missouri when
commuting the death sentence for a triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The next leader of the world's Catholics will be chosen, as
virtually all popes have been, by an extremely select group of men:
Roman Catholic cardinals under the age of 80. Right now, there are
104 cardinal-electors, although that number could rise if John Paul
creates more cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals aren't talking _ Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston
did not return a call seeking comment _ and when the time comes,
they will deliberate behind closed doors inside the Sistine Chapel.
But others have begun to write and speak about the first papal
election of the church's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among journalists at the Vatican, talk of who will be the next
pope started around eight years ago,'' said Marco Tosatti, who for
the last 18 years has been the Vatican correspondent for La Stampa,
a Turin-based daily. ``I've seen so many candidates over the years,
cardinals who six years ago a lot of people would say this could
very likely be the next pope, who are now dead or forgotten or very
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals believe the pope is actually chosen by the Holy
Spirit, who moves through them to guide their voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the cardinals will be looking for a
characteristic and then trying to find the man to fit that,'' said
the Rev. Todd Lajiness, a Detroit native who now works inside the
Vatican. ``That's a political, or I guess you could even say,
democratic, outlook. That's good for government. The church is a
much different entity.''
</P>
<P>
   But most observers say the cardinals also weigh a number of
strategic and political considerations when they gather.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key factors to be weighed when considering the
candidates for pope: age, geography, ideology, diplomatic and
communication skills, and health.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and church officials interviewed in Italy and the
United States generally seemed to agree that the cardinals are
likely to be seeking a pope who is:
</P>
<P>
   --Old. Karol Wojtyla was just 58 when he became Pope John Paul
II, and as a result, his papacy has already lasted 21 years. A long
papacy tends to concentrate church power in Rome, and the cardinals
are expected to look for a pope in his 70s who probably would have
a shorter tenure and accumulate less power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as they like the present pope, there are problems when
a pope stays too long,'' said Richard P. McBrien, a Notre Dame
theologian and author of ``Lives of the Popes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of complaints about this pontificate
because it has tended to recentralize authority in the Vatican, and
there is a lot of resentment of the way they treat bishops like
altar boys. They'd like some breathing space after such a long and
dominating pontificate as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   --European. John Paul is the first Slavic pope, and the first
non-Italian since Hadrian VI died in 1523. The Italian cardinals, a
declining plurality in the College of Cardinals, are expected to
make a play to win the papacy back, and there are also strong
candidates from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals, having made a bold move in choosing a Pole in
1978, are thought likely to retreat to their comfort zone. There is
a long-shot chance that the cardinals would do something more
dramatic, choosing a pope from the Southern Hemisphere to
acknowledge that Africa and Latin America are rapidly becoming the
heart of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no chance the next pope will be an
American, because Americans are viewed as too liberal and too
powerful, and because the one American cardinal in recent years
widely judged to be electable, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin of
Chicago, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American has no chance,'' said Brian H. Smith, professor of
religion at Ripon College. ``The American church is looked upon as
too liberal, we have a very outspoken laity, and America represents
wealth and power in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   --Conservative, but less so than John Paul. The College of
Cardinals is a conservative group, dominated by appointees of John
Paul II. But scholars say the cardinals have historically tended to
oscillate between conservative and more moderate papacies, and
after such a long conservative papacy they may be looking for
someone more open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinals are probably going to look for somebody who is a
bit more liberal, in terms of his views about authority, than the
current pontiff,'' said Fitchburg (Mass.) State College President
Michael P. Riccards, the author of ``Vicars of Christ: Popes,
Power, and Politics in the Modern World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a historic type of occurrence, as the cardinals,
who are pretty sophisticated, realize the institution has gone as
far as it can in one direction and try to bring it back to an even
keel,'' Riccards said.
</P>
<P>
   --Media-savvy and diplomatic. John Paul is the most traveled
pope in history, having taken 91 international trips during his
papacy; as a former actor he has been praised for his use of the
media to communicate positive images of the church, and he has
successfully improved relations with other religions. These
characteristics, particularly in an Information Age in which popes
are sure to remain highly visible, seem certain to become permanent
requirements for future popes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few positions in the modern world that have the
kind of visibility and moral force to them that the papacy can
have, and I think John Paul II has utilized that,'' said the Rev.
Donald P. Senior, president of Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago. ``The travels of the pope, and his use of the media have
become ingredients of the modern papacy. You couldn't have somebody
who would ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   This pope has succeeded at communicating despite his
increasingly slurred speech. He kisses the earth on arriving in a
new place, meets with youth, and prays in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the age of communication, the pope must have the ability to
communicate, . . . but there are many styles of communication,''
said Pietro Scoppola, an Italian religious history professor.
``This pope uses communication of the symbolical. There are times
he speaks and we can't understand everything he's saying, but the
image of him and his sickness symbolizes the weakness in all
humanity, the mystery of creation.''

ONE TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're calling this the top.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists backed $2.4 billion worth of deals in New
England in the first quarter of 2000, a startling record that
shatters last quarter's historic high by 52 percent. Hot software,
Web, and telecommunications companies landed bigger piles of money
than ever before, as deep-pocketed venture firms looked to put
their funds to work.
</P>
<P>
   All that may have happened before the Nasdaq market hit its
March 10 high and before it plunged 34 percent in one violent
month. Hardly anyone thinks the second quarter will be so giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the news from the first quarter is `up, up, better than
ever,' '' said Marcia Hooper, a partner with Advent International
Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But since the market correction, she said, ``I imagine that
there's been a real sharp pullback in funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced venture firms are being much more selective about
the companies they back these days, Hooper said. The best deals
will still be highly competitive, while companies without solid
plans for revenue and profitability will go begging, she said. In
essence, ``the rich will get richer.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend began to take hold in the first quarter, as second-,
third-, and fourth-round financing dominated the rankings of large
local deals, according to the Boston Globe-PricewaterhouseCoopers
Money Tree Survey.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks Inc. of Waltham received $143 million (and has
since filed to go public). Waltham's Digital Broadband
Communications grabbed $75 million, and Bow Street Software of
Portsmouth, N.H., took $60 million, to name just a few of the top
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, nearly one-third of the venture money was
directed to second-round financings. Another 30 percent went to
third-round deals. But even early-stage companies had cash lavished
on them in the first quarter, as $97 million went to seed finance,
nearly triple the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Where venture capitalists put new money in the coming quarter
will depend greatly on the IPO market. The window for taking
companies public got very narrow when the market for tech stocks
tumbled. That means many venture firms are now reassessing their
portfolios and setting aside money for third and fourth rounds of
financing for companies they had hoped to take public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be putting a lot more capital into their existing
companies,'' predicted David Barry, senior editor at the Private
Equity Analyst, a newsletter in Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among market watchers is that the appetite for
IPOs may not come back until September.
</P>
<P>
   If the summer doldrums are about to roll over the venture
capital world, where does that leave eager entrepreneurs?
</P>
<P>
   In a slightly humbler spot, venture investors say. Start-up
founders of every stripe commanded huge premiums for their
companies and ideas only a few months ago, but are becoming more
flexible again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a softness,'' Advent's Hooper said. ``There's
clearly more of a willingness on the part of the entrepreneurs to
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   That can mean lower valuations for their companies. It can also
mean giving up bigger stakes to venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fritz, chief of BancBoston Capital _ the top dealmaker in
the region in the first quarter, with 45 deals worth $115 million _
said that's a benefit of the Nasdaq correction. ``There has already
been a downward value adjustment in most of the sectors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-consumer is cold as ice. And the third, fourth, and
fifth copycats in business-to-business sites aren't getting
investors excited either.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hooper: ``The B-to-C marketplace has just collapsed. Even
the B-to-B marketplace has started to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk that business-to-business has been
overdone, such companies saw their funding jump 15-fold, growing
faster than any other group, to $1.4 billion nationally over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   When those companies start lining up to go public, many will
never make it, said Patrick Gray, a partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Boston. And many of the Nasdaq-listed
companies that were doing deals no longer have hot stocks with
which to buy companies, which closes off the buyout option for
smaller start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   So what's still attractive to venture capitalists in this
market? Telecommunications infrastructure and equipment, said
Advent's Hooper. Not only are such companies growing, but they have
the potential to be bought out by giant players such as Cisco,
Lucent, and Nortel. They don't have to rely on the IPO market, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies, electronic marketing, and Web customer
service players are also still hot, as is Web infrastructure, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists will make their investments, in part, in
sectors sought by the buy-side investors who run mutual funds and
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Lewis _ managing director at Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill, a
Boston-based investment banking firm _ said nearly 500 mutual fund
managers and analysts showed up at the firm's Internet and
Information Technology conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors feel they can get good companies at cheaper
prices now, Lewis said. And they're less willing to take risks on
money-losing companies, she said. ``When they don't have earnings,
they're less willing to pay the same lofty multiple.''
</P>
<P>
   Those higher expectations are going to make life tougher for
venture capitalists in the coming months. The big wins will be
harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Said Barry, the newsletter editor: ``I don't think the venture
industry is going to be the fun place that it's been for the past
three years. It's going to get real hard.''

NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE CONTROLLING SUCCESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Roman Catholics in New York began to take the measure
of their next archbishop, Edward M. Egan, who has been bishop of
Bridgeport, Conn., for more than a decade. At a press conference
Thursday, hours after the Vatican announced the appointment, the
archbishop-designate showed himself to be multilingual, answering
questions in English, Italian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Egan comes to his new post with a reputation as an effective
administrator and fund-raiser. But another way to view the bishop's
selection is from the perspective of the appointments made by Pope
John Paul II. Simply put, the pontiff has reshaped the U.S. church
hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled
vacancy after vacancy with men who share his own vision of how the
church should be run _ and not just in the United States, but in
other parts of the world as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The process has been gradual, but its effect has been profound.
John Paul, moreover, has begun a second round of appointments,
selecting prelates to succeed bishops he himself once appointed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, in his 11th year as pope, John Paul had chosen leaders
for the archdioceses of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los
Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington; these archbishops
traditionally become cardinals. In the 11 years since, he has
repeated the process, with Cardinal Adam Maida in Detroit
succeeding Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who was chosen in 1981; Cardinal
Francis George in Chicago replacing the late Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, appointed in 1982; and now Egan in New York succeeding
the late Cardinal John O'Connor, appointed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul may go on to select new archbishops for Philadelphia
and Washington, to succeed Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who was
appointed in 1988, and Cardinal James Hickey, a 1980 appointment.
Both men are long past the official church retirement age of 75.
The pope has also named new archbishops for major sees like
Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis and many others.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of appointments, the Rev. David M.
O'Connell, president of the Catholic University of America, in
Washington, said John Paul II has ``had the most influence of any
pope in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Longevity has helped. Elected in 1978 at a relatively youthful
58, John Paul II, who turns 80 on Thursday, has reigned longer than
any other 20th-century pope _ longer than all but six of his 261
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply benefiting from a long life, John Paul II
has demonstrated that he knows which characteristics he wants in
the men in the front ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the current crop of U.S. cardinals are known
for various strengths. Chicago's George, for example, is highly
regarded as an intellectual; Cardinal William Keeler in Baltimore
is considered a leader in ecumenical relations.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinals share important, basic qualities. They are
``doctrinally steadfast,'' thoroughly loyal to the Vatican, said
Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and Catholic
studies at Georgetown University in Washington. ``I think there's a
premium put on obedience to Rome, particularly for cardinals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they are not inclined to innovation. In 1980, the pope
warned some of the Latin American bishops against embracing
political ideas arising from liberation theology, which states a
preference for the poor. Speaking in Mexico that year, he said
church leaders must safeguard ``the purity of doctrine.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the U.S. bishops are more cautious than they were 15
years ago, when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops engaged
in sweeping pastoral letters on such broad and highly charged
topics as war and peace, and American capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see no moves by the bishops to write a major pastoral
letter,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine
America, who is an authority on the bishops' conference. ``They
passed Ex Corde Ecclesia the way the Vatican wanted it,'' he said,
referring to a long-discussed document on the relationship between
Catholic colleges and the church hierarchy, adopted by the bishops
last November. It contained a controversial provision that will
require theologians to obtain a mandate from their local bishop
certifying that what they are teaching is fully within church
doctrine. ``The new generation of bishops,'' Reese said, ``is not
going to argue with the Vatican on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That new generation will be leading the church for some years.
(It is a group of prelates that in the United States remains
overwhelmingly white, even as recent immigration has made the
people in the pews more ethnically diverse, a change that will take
some time to make itself more apparent in the hierarchy.)
</P>
<P>
   Reese, who studies appointments to the College of Cardinals in
Rome, said that more than 90 percent of its voting members _ the
prelates under age 80 _ owe their status to John Paul II. The
120-member body will select his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His influence will not end with his death,'' Gillis said.
``His influence will go on for a number of years after his
papacy.''

THE MAN WHO SAVED THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (EDS: Boldface word in 2nd graf should be italicized.)  
 By CHARLES PAIKERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made of the National Basketball Association's
post-Michael Jordan blues, epitomized by financially troubled
franchises, declining television ratings, a rash of empty seats at
regular season games and overly drawn-out playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cassandras bemoan the current state of a league
that does, after all, generate over a billion dollars in revenue,
the Basketball Hall of Fame is considering the inclusion of a
long-forgotten Italian immigrant bowling-alley proprietor from
Syracuse, N.Y., who saved the game when it was  &UR; really &LR;  in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1953-54 season, the future of the five-year
old NBA was very much in doubt. The game's biggest star, George
Mikan, had retired, and attendance was falling sharply in a league
that had dwindled to nine teams from 17 just five years earlier.
Making matters worse was the increasing tendency of teams to slow
down the game to protect leads or prevent more talented opponents
from getting the ball. The final score of one game in 1950 was
19-18, and it wasn't uncommon for a team to pass the ball around
for five minutes before taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball, which after all was in the entertainment
business, had committed a mortal sin: It had become boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things went from bad to worse,'' said Maurice Podoloff, the
league commissioner at the time. ``The games were interminable.
Attendance was suffering. We were in a desperate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Danny Biasone, the feisty owner of the Syracuse Nationals.
Biasone had emigrated from Sicily in 1918, when he was 10 years
old, and by 1946 he owned a bowling alley and a liquor store in
Syracuse. Biasone, a self-described sports nut, got so upset when
the nearby Rochester Royals allegedly refused to play a game in
Syracuse that he vowed to get the city its own pro basketball team.
Which he promptly did, procuring a franchise from the National
Basketball League in 1946 for the grand sum of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The players became part of Biasone's family. His wife cooked
pasta and laundered uniforms for the young men, who had to hold
down other jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. In Syracuse,
they hung out at Biasone's blue-collar bowling alley. On the road
they took long bus and train rides to play in smoky arenas with
names like ``The Tub of Blood,'' where hostile fans would shake the
basket while the players were shooting and occasionally run out on
the floor to slug them with pocketbooks or bare fists.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone loved it all, and couldn't bear to see his beloved Nats,
now in the NBA, go under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew fans weren't paying to see the ball being dribbled
around all night,'' he said in an interview in the mid-1980s. ``So
I went to those fellas in the league and said I'm having a tough
time selling something here. There's one thing basketball needs, I
said. It needs a time. I don't care what the time is. Put in a
time!''
</P>
<P>
   The other owners were skeptical. But Biasone won them over in
August 1954 when he invited them to Syracuse to watch his idea in
action. On a hot and humid afternoon at Biasone's alma mater,
Vocational High School, the future Hall-of-Famer Dolph Schayes and
other local players played the first game in which each team had to
shoot the ball within 24 seconds or lose possession.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone started yelling at them if the clock got down to five
seconds, while NBA patriarchs like Ned Irish of the New York Knicks
and Walter Brown of the Boston Celtics saw the future of the game
unfold before them as the players streaked up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The league instituted the 24-second rule that fall, scoring
soared and the pro game was revived. (The Syracuse Nats also won
their first and only championship that season).
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption of the clock was the most important event in the
NBA,'' Podoloff said, ``and Danny Biasone is the most important man
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he sold the Syracuse Nats to a group of Philadelphia
businessmen in 1963 for $500,000, Biasone languished in obscurity.
He continued to run the neighborhood bowling alley until his death
30 years later, and, despite several nominations, was never voted
into the Basketball Hall of Fame. His supporters hope that
historical neglect will be rectified next week, however, when the
Hall of Fame, which is once again reviewing Biasone's
contributions, announces the newest members of the league's
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   And why 24 seconds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we were averaging about 60 shots a game per team,''
Biasone said. ``If each team used up 24 seconds for a shot, they
would average 60 shots. But the exact number wasn't important. My
idea was to keep the game going, to speed it up.''

THE MAN WHO SAVED THE NBA

<P>
   Much has been made of the National Basketball Association's
post-Michael Jordan blues, epitomized by financially troubled
franchises, declining television ratings, a rash of empty seats at
regular season games and overly drawn-out playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cassandras bemoan the current state of a league
that does, after all, generate over a billion dollars in revenue,
the Basketball Hall of Fame is considering the inclusion of a
long-forgotten Italian immigrant bowling-alley proprietor from
Syracuse, N.Y., who saved the game when it was  &UR; really &LR;  in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1953-54 season, the future of the five-year
old NBA was very much in doubt. The game's biggest star, George
Mikan, had retired, and attendance was falling sharply in a league
that had dwindled to nine teams from 17 just five years earlier.
Making matters worse was the increasing tendency of teams to slow
down the game to protect leads or prevent more talented opponents
from getting the ball. The final score of one game in 1950 was
19-18, and it wasn't uncommon for a team to pass the ball around
for five minutes before taking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball, which after all was in the entertainment
business, had committed a mortal sin: It had become boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things went from bad to worse,'' said Maurice Podoloff, the
league commissioner at the time. ``The games were interminable.
Attendance was suffering. We were in a desperate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Danny Biasone, the feisty owner of the Syracuse Nationals.
Biasone had emigrated from Sicily in 1918, when he was 10 years
old, and by 1946 he owned a bowling alley and a liquor store in
Syracuse. Biasone, a self-described sports nut, got so upset when
the nearby Rochester Royals allegedly refused to play a game in
Syracuse that he vowed to get the city its own pro basketball team.
Which he promptly did, procuring a franchise from the National
Basketball League in 1946 for the grand sum of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The players became part of Biasone's family. His wife cooked
pasta and laundered uniforms for the young men, who had to hold
down other jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. In Syracuse,
they hung out at Biasone's blue-collar bowling alley. On the road
they took long bus and train rides to play in smoky arenas with
names like ``The Tub of Blood,'' where hostile fans would shake the
basket while the players were shooting and occasionally run out on
the floor to slug them with pocketbooks or bare fists.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone loved it all, and couldn't bear to see his beloved Nats,
now in the NBA, go under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew fans weren't paying to see the ball being dribbled
around all night,'' he said in an interview in the mid-1980s. ``So
I went to those fellas in the league and said I'm having a tough
time selling something here. There's one thing basketball needs, I
said. It needs a time. I don't care what the time is. Put in a
time!''
</P>
<P>
   The other owners were skeptical. But Biasone won them over in
August 1954 when he invited them to Syracuse to watch his idea in
action. On a hot and humid afternoon at Biasone's alma mater,
Vocational High School, the future Hall-of-Famer Dolph Schayes and
other local players played the first game in which each team had to
shoot the ball within 24 seconds or lose possession.
</P>
<P>
   Biasone started yelling at them if the clock got down to five
seconds, while NBA patriarchs like Ned Irish of the New York Knicks
and Walter Brown of the Boston Celtics saw the future of the game
unfold before them as the players streaked up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The league instituted the 24-second rule that fall, scoring
soared and the pro game was revived. (The Syracuse Nats also won
their first and only championship that season).
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption of the clock was the most important event in the
NBA,'' Podoloff said, ``and Danny Biasone is the most important man
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he sold the Syracuse Nats to a group of Philadelphia
businessmen in 1963 for $500,000, Biasone languished in obscurity.
He continued to run the neighborhood bowling alley until his death
30 years later, and, despite several nominations, was never voted
into the Basketball Hall of Fame. His supporters hope that
historical neglect will be rectified next week, however, when the
Hall of Fame, which is once again reviewing Biasone's
contributions, announces the newest members of the league's
pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   And why 24 seconds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we were averaging about 60 shots a game per team,''
Biasone said. ``If each team used up 24 seconds for a shot, they
would average 60 shots. But the exact number wasn't important. My
idea was to keep the game going, to speed it up.''

LETTING THE GENE OUT OF THE BOTTLE

<P>
   In the annals of bureaucratic slip-ups, this one was a beaut.
Last December, an obscure government agency known as the European
Patent Office mistakenly issued the first patent to allow the
cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, critics say, it may have
granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup of the
entire human species.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, issued in Munich, Germany, is No. EP-0695351B1. It
gives its holder, the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, the sole
right to make, use and sell human beings created in its laboratory.
The university has the legal right, at least for the next 20 years,
to prevent competitors in 19 European countries from copying its
techniques without paying the university a fee.
</P>
<P>
   True, the University of Edinburgh, where Darwin once studied,
intended none of this _ it wanted only to patent certain laboratory
methods that may prove useful in fighting diseases like
Parkinson's. The patent office intended none of this, either _
someone forgot to require the correct legal disclaimers during
nearly six years of patent review. Greenpeace, the environmental
group, discovered the flawed patent and mounted a noisy protest in
February, after which the office acknowledged its error.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are no reported techniques for producing people
(except for the time-honored one) and even if there were, European
research rules ban human cloning. If renegade Scottish scientists
chose to clone humans anyway, the scientists would presumably be
arrested under anti-slavery laws.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever anyone did or did not do, this case of ``Brave New
World'' meets the Marx Brothers will not be untangled anytime soon.
The appeals process for overturning the 1999 patent is sure to take
years. An unrelated 1997 patent involving pig production is flawed
in the same way, according to Greenpeace researchers, who filed an
appeal, but the patent office disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Patents have long been issued by governments, granting the
exclusive right to profit from commercially applicable inventions.
Biopatents, however, are recent and are based largely on one
laboratory mouse. In 1988, Harvard University patented the first
``transgenic'' animal, a genetically altered mouse predisposed to
getting cancer. After a patent moratorium in the United States
ended in 1993, biotech investors turned bullish on brave new mice
(and cows, pigs and, most famously, Dolly, the cloned sheep)
because of biopatents.
</P>
<P>
   Patents don't stop with four-legged animals. Private companies
and a U.S.-British consortium, the Human Genome Project, have been
racing for years to compile the complete catalog of mankind's
genes, or genome. It may be only weeks before a research team
claims credit for explicating a human being as a list of chemical
``letters'' longer than 800 Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain proposed that data from the human genome be made publicly
available without the legal restrictions of patents.
</P>
<P>
   Patent lawyers, however, say the Clinton-Blair proposal does
nothing to diminish the value of gene patents. ``Making the
alphabet publicly available has not reduced the value of novels,''
said Colin Sandercock, a patent lawyer specializing in
biotechnology in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But patent law will have to be revised and strengthened in the
biotech age, some lawyers say. In Europe, at least, an appeals
process can overturn challenged patents as in the Edinburgh case.
But in the United States challenged patents simply lead to
drawn-out litigation without a clear resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology, meanwhile, has raced so far ahead of patent law
that scientists are encouraged to try to patent everything in their
labs. Eric Juengst, a former director of the ethics program at the
Human Genome Project, compares overly broad patents to the Oklahoma
land rush of the 1890s. ``You had every incentive to say, `I claim
everything between here and the river,' no matter what was in
between,'' said Juengst, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Broad patents may grant far-reaching rights at a time when
genetic engineering is still in its infancy. For example, something
called germline manipulation may have more long-term consequences
than human cloning, experts say. A clone, after all, is simply an
identical twin separated in time. But animals, including human
beings, whose genetic makeup, or germline, has been altered pass on
a new set of genes to their children and their children's children,
and so, through many generations, have a potential impact on the
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowly speaking, you can't patent a gene because everyone's
genes are their own,'' said David Magnus, a philosophy professor
who led a recent scholarly conference at the University of
Pennsylvania titled ``Who Owns Life?'' But, he said, scientists can
and do patent the use of genes and parts of genes known as
``expressed sequence tags.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, when someone's susceptibility to, say, breast
cancer is cured with a patented gene therapy, Magnus said, the
patient is not patentable nor are her children.
</P>
<P>
   But the repaired genes are the scientist's patented genes, he
said. Noting that it would be a ``public relations disaster,''
Magnus nonetheless noted that ``it may be legally possible for the
scientist to restrict your right to have children and pass on the
patented genes, without his permission.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Edinburgh case, the patent application applies to a
mousetrap not yet invented. It was drafted in 1994 without
disclaimers like ``transgenic nonhuman animal'' that are routine
today. ``In the context of this invention,'' the approved patent
reads, ``the term animal cell is intended to embrace all animal
cells, especially of mammalian species, including human cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the laboratory techniques described in the patent
apply to special human cells known as stem cells, which are a kind
of primordial clay that may someday be cultured into organ tissue
and, perhaps, entire human beings.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the European Patent Office said its 200 biopatent
examiners would be even more vigilant in reviewing the 6,500
applications received last year, up from 5,100 the year before. The
Edinburgh application was more than 200 pages.

   A Ringing Endorsement for Bush
</P>
<P>
   Looking a bit like a teen-ager forced to attend a classical
music concert, Sen. John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with
Gov. George W. Bush at a news conference on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I
 &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush,'' McCain intoned over and over, after a
reporter asked why he seemed so reluctant to use the word.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition probably had the effect McCain intended: It
reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the
negative turn that the primary campaign _ and some of Bush's
commercials _ had taken, McCain had for weeks resisted falling into
line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did
so last week, saying Bush had the ``vision, knowledge and
expertise'' to be president _ and that he himself had no interest
in being Bush's vice president _ there was a tight, grudging
quality to the event.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm that the political and journalistic worlds have
for months been hanging on McCain's every word, his utterance of
that single word was the major political news of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed pleased to have gotten over that hump, but Vice
President Al Gore reminded audiences that the two Republicans were
not all that in sync. Speaking that same day in Washington to the
Anti-Defamation League, Gore brought up an issue that divides Bush
and McCain, the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to remain silent about it,'' Gore said, an
allusion to Bush's deferring to the people of South Carolina on the
issue. (McCain recently declared he had erred in not announcing
earlier that he favors the flag's removal.)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, Gore's boss is not remaining silent,
either. It was disclosed last week that President Clinton is
serving as a behind-the-scenes adviser to many Democratic
candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La.

   The German Army Hero, Updated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The past is inexhaustible in Germany. Beyond each confrontation
with the Third Reich, a new accounting always lurks. This time it
was the turn of the army, which has tended to cling to the notion
that Hitler's crimes were the work of the SS and death squads, not
the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his back on such views, Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping stripped a base of the name of a Wehrmacht general long
regarded as a hero and renamed it after Anton Schmid, a sergeant
who was executed by the Nazis in 1942 after he disobeyed orders and
helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto. Honoring him reflected Germany's
growing determination to place ``Zivilcourage'' _ the courage of
conscience _ above duty in its scale of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I merely behaved as a human being,'' Schmid wrote in his last
letter to his wife. But very few people in Hitler's Reich had the
courage to do that.

   Iran's Reformers Win An Uncertain Victory

   When the votes in the runoff election were counted, Iran's
reformers appeared to have clinched their majority in the new
parliament that is set to open May 27. But they remained on
tenterhooks: The all-important Council of Guardians, dominated by
the hard-liners who have labeled the reformers as foreign agents,
has yet to certify the three-month-old results from first round of

The 47-year-old swimming pool company owner and an unidentified

   Planned Fire Turns Wild  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal government effort to thin dense pine forests with a
controlled burn near Los Alamos, N.M., suddenly burst into a
disastrous wild fire. Heavy winds sent flames racing through
tinder-dry canyons and then residential areas, and even across
portions of the highly sensitive nuclear weapons laboratory at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The local head of the National Park Service, which set the fire,
was suspended, more than 25,000 people had to be evacuated and at
least 260 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear lab suffered no major damage and officials said
there was no release of radioactivity. Still, officials said, it
could take weeks to get the facility running fully again. Officials
also said it could take weeks before services could be restored so
that residents of the area can move back to their homes _ those
that still stand.

   The perils of Internet auctions _ and the potential for fraud _

soared on eBay from 25 cents to $135,805 on speculation that it was

Sacramento, later acknowledged that he had fabricated part of the
story that described the work and had bid on the painting ``for a
friend.'' EBay suspended him and voided the auction.

   Scandal Fallout for Clinton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton leaves the presidency about eight months from
now, few assume that he will hang out a shingle and practice law.
Nonetheless, he is battling to keep his law license in Arkansas in
a proceeding that could result in his being disbarred or suspended
from the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent filing, Clinton disputed the main charge against him
_ that he lied under oath when he denied having had a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ by continuing to insist that
his answers were technically accurate if misleading. A decision may
come later this month.

   Coronation in Russia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more coronation than inauguration _ a palace, a choir,
a red carpet, a huge gold emblem. But after Vladimir Putin was
sworn in as Russia's second president, he pledged to build a
democratic and capitalist nation. Capitalist, yes: His new prime
minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, is an economic liberal who has deftly
renegotiated Russia's Western debt.
</P>
<P>
   But democratic? At week's end, a police raid and search of the
media conglomerate that is the Kremlin's major critic, Media-Most,
left some wondering about Putin's political ideals.

   Onel de Guzman, a 23-year-old computer student, came forward
after several days of hiding and admitted in Manila that ``it is
possible'' he had unleashed the program that crippled e-mail
systems around the world. The Philippine National Bureau of
Investigation did not immediately call de Guzman a suspect, but
said agents would question him.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, a student at the AMA Computer College, was suspected
after it was learned that he had submitted a thesis proposal that
resembled the destructive virus that paralyzed the accounts of
e-mail recipients who opened an attachment with the subject line,
``I Love You.'' His lawyer said de Guzman was ``not really aware
that the act imputed to him was done by him.''

   Ever the optimist, former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana
said that prison is ``nothing to be afraid of.'' The prison system
is well-managed, he said, and provides its residents with food,
medical attention and a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards may well have a chance to test his assessment first-hand
at some point. He, his son, and three other co-defendants were
convicted on Tuesday by a U.S. District Court jury in Baton Rouge
on racketeering charges related to the extortion of businessmen
seeking riverboat casino licenses. The 72-year-old Edwards, a
four-term governor who escaped conviction in two criminal trials in
the 1980s, has vowed to appeal.

   Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, the Army's top female officer, won
an early round in her sexual harassment case when the Army's
inspector general concluded that she had been the victim of sexual
harassment four years ago. At least two reviews are needed before a
final decision by the vice chief of the Army. Kennedy charged that
Brig. Gen. Larry G. Smith accosted her in her Pentagon office after
a routine briefing. It is the first time one general has accused
another of sexual harassment.

   A Ringing Endorsement for Bush
</P>
<P>
   Looking a bit like a teen-ager forced to attend a classical
music concert, Sen. John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with
Gov. George W. Bush at a news conference on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I  &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush, I
 &UR; endorse &LR;  Governor Bush,'' McCain intoned over and over, after a
reporter asked why he seemed so reluctant to use the word.
</P>
<P>
   The repetition probably had the effect McCain intended: It
reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the
negative turn that the primary campaign _ and some of Bush's
commercials _ had taken, McCain had for weeks resisted falling into
line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did
so last week, saying Bush had the ``vision, knowledge and
expertise'' to be president _ and that he himself had no interest
in being Bush's vice president _ there was a tight, grudging
quality to the event.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm that the political and journalistic worlds have
for months been hanging on McCain's every word, his utterance of
that single word was the major political news of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed pleased to have gotten over that hump, but Vice
President Al Gore reminded audiences that the two Republicans were
not all that in sync. Speaking that same day in Washington to the
Anti-Defamation League, Gore brought up an issue that divides Bush
and McCain, the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to remain silent about it,'' Gore said, an
allusion to Bush's deferring to the people of South Carolina on the
issue. (McCain recently declared he had erred in not announcing
earlier that he favors the flag's removal.)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, Gore's boss is not remaining silent,
either. It was disclosed last week that President Clinton is
serving as a behind-the-scenes adviser to many Democratic
candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La.

   The German Army Hero, Updated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The past is inexhaustible in Germany. Beyond each confrontation
with the Third Reich, a new accounting always lurks. This time it
was the turn of the army, which has tended to cling to the notion
that Hitler's crimes were the work of the SS and death squads, not
the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
   Turning his back on such views, Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping stripped a base of the name of a Wehrmacht general long
regarded as a hero and renamed it after Anton Schmid, a sergeant
who was executed by the Nazis in 1942 after he disobeyed orders and
helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto. Honoring him reflected Germany's
growing determination to place ``Zivilcourage'' _ the courage of
conscience _ above duty in its scale of values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I merely behaved as a human being,'' Schmid wrote in his last
letter to his wife. But very few people in Hitler's Reich had the
courage to do that.

   Iran's Reformers Win An Uncertain Victory
</P>
<P>
   When the votes in the runoff election were counted, Iran's
reformers appeared to have clinched their majority in the new
parliament that is set to open May 27. But they remained on
tenterhooks: The all-important Council of Guardians, dominated by
the hard-liners who have labeled the reformers as foreign agents,
has yet to certify the three-month-old results from first round of
voting in the capital, Tehran, as well as the runoff races.

   A New Way to Diet  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ross walked into a suburban Detroit convenience store last
week with a $100 bill and bought a hot dog for himself and 98
lottery tickets for his wife Nancy. Now they're multimillionaires,
after purchasing one of the two winning Big Game lottery tickets.
The 47-year-old swimming pool company owner and an unidentified
ticket holder in Illinois will split $363 million, a record for a
lottery in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't eaten in three days,'' he said. Was it the
excitement or the hot dog?

   Planned Fire Turns Wild  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A federal government effort to thin dense pine forests with a
controlled burn near Los Alamos, N.M., suddenly burst into a
disastrous wild fire. Heavy winds sent flames racing through
tinder-dry canyons and then residential areas, and even across
portions of the highly sensitive nuclear weapons laboratory at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The local head of the National Park Service, which set the fire,
was suspended, more than 25,000 people had to be evacuated and at
least 260 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear lab suffered no major damage and officials said
there was no release of radioactivity. Still, officials said, it
could take weeks to get the facility running fully again. Officials
also said it could take weeks before services could be restored so
that residents of the area can move back to their homes _ those
that still stand.

   Let the Bidder Beware
</P>
<P>
   The perils of Internet auctions _ and the potential for fraud _
were highlighted when the price of a ``great, big, wild'' painting
soared on eBay from 25 cents to $135,805 on speculation that it was
by the artist Richard Diebenkorn. The seller, Kenneth A. Walton of
Sacramento, later acknowledged that he had fabricated part of the
story that described the work and had bid on the painting ``for a
friend.'' EBay suspended him and voided the auction.

   Scandal Fallout for Clinton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton leaves the presidency about eight months from
now, few assume that he will hang out a shingle and practice law.
Nonetheless, he is battling to keep his law license in Arkansas in
a proceeding that could result in his being disbarred or suspended
from the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent filing, Clinton disputed the main charge against him
_ that he lied under oath when he denied having had a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ by continuing to insist that
his answers were technically accurate if misleading. A decision may
come later this month.

   Coronation in Russia  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more coronation than inauguration _ a palace, a choir,
a red carpet, a huge gold emblem. But after Vladimir Putin was
sworn in as Russia's second president, he pledged to build a
democratic and capitalist nation. Capitalist, yes: His new prime
minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, is an economic liberal who has deftly
renegotiated Russia's Western debt.
</P>
<P>
   But democratic? At week's end, a police raid and search of the
media conglomerate that is the Kremlin's major critic, Media-Most,
left some wondering about Putin's political ideals.

   A Hacker Found (Perhaps)
</P>
<P>
   Onel de Guzman, a 23-year-old computer student, came forward
after several days of hiding and admitted in Manila that ``it is
possible'' he had unleashed the program that crippled e-mail
systems around the world. The Philippine National Bureau of
Investigation did not immediately call de Guzman a suspect, but
said agents would question him.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, a student at the AMA Computer College, was suspected
after it was learned that he had submitted a thesis proposal that
resembled the destructive virus that paralyzed the accounts of
e-mail recipients who opened an attachment with the subject line,
``I Love You.'' His lawyer said de Guzman was ``not really aware
that the act imputed to him was done by him.''

   HAMILTON-JORDAN _ Twenty years ago, Hamilton Jordan was the
gatekeeper who controlled access to the most powerful man in the
country, a brash newcomer to Washington who moonlighted as
Georgetown's most notorious pubcrawler. Today, former President
Carter's chief-of-staff has no power than any other Little League
assistant coach. Between one life and another, he went through a
divorce, has survived cancer three times, run for the U.S. Senate
and lost, and gone from a thirtyish Beltway climber to a sedate
middle-aged Buckhead father of three young children. In his book
``No Such Thing As a Bad Day,'' Jordan reflects on the bumps in the
road and what he's learned in a life out of the public eye. We
profile Jordan at 55, a political has-been who believes he's never
been more alive. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45.

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR: HUGGING AND KISSING YOUR WAY INTO THE WHITE
HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, it was hard to say whether the
scene looked more like a television chat show or a ``Saturday Night
Live'' parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov.
George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican
officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their
first guest.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, out walked an adorable second-grader with a giant white
bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women
beamed, Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, ``How is it here in
the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, very,'' she whispered into her hand-held microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too,'' confided Bush, who was using her to showcase his
interest in literacy and foreign language instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the infantilization of politics. Ever since President
Clinton won re-election four years ago with child-centered issues
like school uniforms, literacy and teen-age smoking, candidates
have increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role
of Santa Claus, and not running for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, politicians have always kissed babies. And yes, even in
1988, both George Bush, the father, and Michael Dukakis were vying
to be the education president. But it was Clinton who built a whole
campaign around children, displaying his empathy for working
parents by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into
a school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded
tykes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, once complained, ``You give
President Clinton five minutes on television, he'll mention
children 15 times.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around there are no complaints. Everybody's doing it.
Just try to count how many times over the last year that Bush has
read ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to kindergartners to
demonstrate his commitment to literacy. He said it was his favorite
book from childhood _ no matter that it wasn't published until
1969, a year after he graduated from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Al Gore in New Hampshire, where he not only knelt
to read ``Tikvah Means Hope'' to 6-year-old Nikkita Gottling, but
bought her the book and autographed it?
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore can regularly be found in schools, eating in
the cafeteria or sitting at a student's desk. This habit may even
have raised the level of debate. At one high school, students were
discussing the Plessy vs. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the concept of separate but equal facilities
for blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have put education and the decline of civic and cultural
values at the top of their list of concerns. The boomers have made
raising children an obsession, while more and more women voters are
trying to balance motherhood and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you will check out your Jeep Cherokee, you will see the
vanity mirror is on both sides,'' said Alex Castellanos, a
Republican political consultant. ``It's now on the driver's side
and the soccer mom has her hand on the steering wheel. The soccer
mom is 70 percent of consumer spending. Two out of three new
college entrants are women. The economic power has shifted and
she's still the key swing voter in suburban America.''
</P>
<P>
   What better way to play gender politics than by having a child
on your lap? It telegraphs warmth, empathy and understanding.
``Everyone who is running for office has to bend over backward to
show that they know what it's like to be a typical American
family,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wanted a demonstration of the emotional power of an
encounter with a child had only to watch Clinton hug a boy on
crutches at the funeral for Cardinal John O'Connor of New York,
leaving the other dignitaries looking stiff and remote by
comparison. Still, a few lonely voices in both parties deplore the
dumbing down of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It atrophies the muscle of political debate,'' says Jeff Faux,
a liberal Democrat at the Economic Institute, a Washington policy
research center, who argues that it all started with Ronald
Reagan's success with political imagery.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, blames
Clinton. ``The kid card is used as a trump and it trumps all
debate,'' he said. ``You say this is good for our kids and that's
the end of it, instead of here are the arguments for and against
the measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Bill Bradley and John McCain, the primary candidates
who ran on ``authenticity'' and ``substance,'' lost.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, politicians are using people as props more than ever.
They hold small panel discussions with people who agree with them,
to highlight some policy proposal. The elderly are paraded for
discussion of Social Security. Nurses stand around listening to
talk of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans say they are delighted they have a nominee with
some of Clinton's political skills and an ability to soften their
party's image. ``Unfortunately, politics is about symbols and I
don't even think you can overdo it,'' said David Horowitz, whose
pamphlet ``The Art of Political War'' has been circulating among
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls have shown Bush in the lead, and making a
strong showing among married women, a swing group that Clinton won
in 1996. So don't be surprised to see Bush and Gore surrounded by
children, reading away like school librarians, right up to
November.

   ``Officials have begun to express anger at the National Park
Service, which set what it had hoped would be a controlled fire.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Times, May 12, 2000, in an article about a large
wildfire in Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 24, 2000 _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
today that it would conduct a controlled meltdown at the Pilgrim
Nuclear Power Plant in Plymouth, Mass. The meltdown is part of an
annual safety measure, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps the thing from going all kooky,'' said the Pilgrim
safety chief, Edward McGahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the weather is dry like this, the rods, the core, all
that nuclear stuff could melt or explode or something,'' McGahan
added. ``See, this way, if we do it on purpose, it can't meltdown
on its own by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 16, 2000 _ Officials at Hoover Dam said today that they
would blow up the dam this weekend. Speaking at a news conference,
Tom Drymalski, the director of safety, said: ``There's all that
water building up and there's, like, pressure. So this guy Phil,
from maintenance, said, `Dude, what would happen if the dam broke?'
So then we got to thinking that we should blow it up and rebuild
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by reporters about the effect of releasing 28,537,000
acre-feet of water, Drymalski said, ``Well, we hadn't really
thought of that, but it'll probably be pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   March 9, 2001 _ ``It's impossible to know what the Belgians will
do,'' said an angry Pentagon official today at a news conference to
announce that the United States would drop a nuclear bomb on
Belgium Monday afternoon. ``They're Belgians. What if they attack
first?'' Gen. William Landay said. He added that it was not
uncommon for the Pentagon to try to avoid disaster by actually
creating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People underestimate Belgium,'' he said. ``I bet you didn't
know that the Belgians tried to invade this country just two weeks
ago but were turned away at Customs because of expired passports.''
</P>
<P>
   July 3, 2001 _ Police in Washington, D.C., announced that all
officers on the force would be required to shoot themselves at the
beginning of each shift. The move was immediately hailed by law
enforcement agencies nationwide. ``These are violent times,'' said
the Washington police chief, Lars Gustafson. ``I don't want to
stand here while our guys are out there getting shot on the street.
I would much rather they do it themselves. This way, I think, we're
all better prepared.''

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR: HUGGING AND KISSING YOUR WAY INTO THE WHITE
HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, it was hard to say whether the
scene looked more like a television chat show or a ``Saturday Night
Live'' parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov.
George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican
officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their
first guest.
</P>
<P>
   On cue, out walked an adorable second-grader with a giant white
bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women
beamed, Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, ``How is it here in
the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, very,'' she whispered into her hand-held microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too,'' confided Bush, who was using her to showcase his
interest in literacy and foreign language instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the infantilization of politics. Ever since President
Clinton won re-election four years ago with child-centered issues
like school uniforms, literacy and teen-age smoking, candidates
have increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role
of Santa Claus, and not running for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, politicians have always kissed babies. And yes, even in
1988, both George Bush, the father, and Michael Dukakis were vying
to be the education president. But it was Clinton who built a whole
campaign around children, displaying his empathy for working
parents by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into
a school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded
tykes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, once complained, ``You give
President Clinton five minutes on television, he'll mention
children 15 times.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around there are no complaints. Everybody's doing it.
Just try to count how many times over the last year that Bush has
read ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to kindergartners to
demonstrate his commitment to literacy. He said it was his favorite
book from childhood _ no matter that it wasn't published until
1969, a year after he graduated from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Al Gore in New Hampshire, where he not only knelt
to read ``Tikvah Means Hope'' to 6-year-old Nikkita Gottling, but
bought her the book and autographed it?
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore can regularly be found in schools, eating in
the cafeteria or sitting at a student's desk. This habit may even
have raised the level of debate. At one high school, students were
discussing the Plessy vs. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the concept of separate but equal facilities
for blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have put education and the decline of civic and cultural
values at the top of their list of concerns. The boomers have made
raising children an obsession, while more and more women voters are
trying to balance motherhood and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you will check out your Jeep Cherokee, you will see the
vanity mirror is on both sides,'' said Alex Castellanos, a
Republican political consultant. ``It's now on the driver's side
and the soccer mom has her hand on the steering wheel. The soccer
mom is 70 percent of consumer spending. Two out of three new
college entrants are women. The economic power has shifted and
she's still the key swing voter in suburban America.''
</P>
<P>
   What better way to play gender politics than by having a child
on your lap? It telegraphs warmth, empathy and understanding.
``Everyone who is running for office has to bend over backward to
show that they know what it's like to be a typical American
family,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant.

WHO'S LEFT (OR RIGHT) TO CAST THE FIRST STONE?

(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   The presumptive Senate candidate tells reporters that his
marriage is kaput _ possibly even before informing the mother of
his children. He has already announced his high regard for the
``very good friend'' who accompanied him to a recent press dinner.
A few hours later, his wife counters with her own news conference,
choking on tears as she says that her husband has not only been
unfaithful but serially unfaithful, previously with a member of his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   And the public's reaction? Instant statewide polling suggested
that New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's personal problems would
have no effect on how most voters would view his candidacy. A Daily
News headline summed it up: ``Voters Don't Care.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't that Americans are no longer concerned with moral
issues; they may simply be drawing the line between public and
private behavior that the media no longer draws for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Americans have punished candidates who made them
aware of their messy intimate lives.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller divorced Mary Todhunter Clark to
marry Margaretta Fitler Murphy, the public was scandalized, and his
presidential chances crippled. When Ronald Reagan was elected
president in 1980, a mere 28 years into his second marriage, it was
considered a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Voters never got the chance to judge House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who surely deserves a place in the chutzpah hall of fame
for wagging his finger at President Clinton during the impeachment
debate. Gingrich was no longer in power when Americans learned that
he was involved with a congressional staff member at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was about to replace Gingrich as
speaker, decided to step down after his own past indiscretions were
revealed by Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler and
self-appointed hypocrisy cop.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that there is a continuing debate over whether
Giuliani still has a political future shows how far the public has
come since, as William Bennett, a conservative writer and former
secretary of education, says, ``the ancient standards were in place
in the days of yore _ 1987,'' when Gary Hart's presidential
campaign went pfft after the story broke about his affair with
Donna Rice. Even his wife's decision to stand by him did no good.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said adultery, by itself, is no longer fatal for
candidates for higher office, and even such ``complicating
factors'' as lying about an affair, or carrying on with an
underling, seem to matter less and less. While he believes that
those factors should end any campaign for higher office, Bennett
said, ``I'm not having a lot of agreement on that, even around my
own office.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprisingly, several Republicans said they do not
think that Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky is responsible for
the shift in public opinion. Instead they feel that Clinton's
popular success is just more evidence that the culture was moving
in that direction anyway: Voters elected him _ twice _ knowing they
were not getting Ozzie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is anesthetized to all of this in-your-face stuff
about private lives,'' said Rep. Michael Forbes of New York, who
switched parties and became a Democrat last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they don't have concerns and opinions,''
Forbes said. ``But what the public really doesn't like is when you
beat your chest with righteous indignation about somebody else's
behavior and then do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Estrich, who closely followed the Hart drama while running
Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign, says the country seems
to have moved so far so fast since Hart's downfall that today a
messy affair can actually be a plus for a candidate, especially one
who seems to need a little humanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, right now it helps in the weird political world
in which we live,'' she said, ``because watching them be human,
even if it's because they're having an affair, is better than
watching them be politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   New York voters certainly were responding sympathetically when
they recently learned that Giuliani also has prostate cancer, which
he has said will be the prime consideration in deciding whether he
stays in the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With divorce so common, fewer voters and candidates are in a
position to judge others for the same problems they have.
</P>
<P>
   There would obviously be no arms buildup on this issue in a
Giuliani-Clinton matchup, and no commercials from Clinton's
campaign featuring footage of her opponent's distraught wife.
</P>
<P>
   Though most political analysts say the public still holds women
candidates to a higher moral standard, even that appears to be
changing: Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, with strong ties to the
religious right, recently survived revelations of a long-past
affair and was subsequently re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of other, perhaps more subtle factors now influence
whether the public will tolerate private indiscretion from any
given elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Other considerations for voters include how the (apparently)
wronged or exiting spouse reacts. And how well the public likes the
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing Judith Nathan described as a nurse and a single
mom,'' Estrich said, referring to Giuliani's friend, who is 45.
``And I think the situation would be different if she were a
25-year-old aspiring model.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the candidate been hypocritical?
</P>
<P>
   Can he or she take the heat?
</P>
<P>
   How conservative are constituents? (Last year, supporters of
Gary Bauer, the ``family values'' presidential candidate,
criticized him simply for meeting alone with a female staff
member.)
</P>
<P>
   And most important of all: How well did voters like the guy in
the first place?

   Other considerations for voters include how the (apparently)
wronged or exiting spouse reacts. And how well the public likes the
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing Judith Nathan described as a nurse and a single
mom,'' Estrich said, referring to Giuliani's friend, who is 45.
``And I think the situation would be different if she were a
25-year-old aspiring model.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the candidate been hypocritical?
</P>
<P>
   Can he or she take the heat?
</P>
<P>
   How conservative are constituents? (Last year, supporters of
Gary Bauer, the ``family values'' presidential candidate,
criticized him simply for meeting alone with a female staff
member.)
</P>
<P>
   And most important of all: How well did voters like the guy in
the first place?

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We have a one-quart
<TEXT>
Thermos bottle with a busted glass liner, (filler No. 24F). Where
we can go to get a replacement?_ Ed M.
<P>
   A: A new liner is available from Thermos by calling (800)
831-9242 ($10.40 includes S &AMP; H). The now-famous vacuum flask was
invented by Sir James Dewar in 1892. A contest was held to devise a
new moniker. A Munich resident won with Thermos from the Greek
``Therme'' meaning hot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does bottled water _ Aquafina for example _ carry an
expiration date? What happens to it?
</P>
<P>
   _Marty S.
</P>
<P>
   A: It starts to smell. A spokesperson for Aquafina says the
expiration date is a guideline to the water's best flavor. Since
the plastic container is gas-permeable, it eventually absorbs
environmental odors. So if it was in your pantry next to the onion
bin, it might taste like eau d'onion after a few years. The water
can be consumed safely long after the two-year guideline, and will
stay potable until it is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My back yard is full of snails. Some are bigger than a half
dollar. What kind of snails are they? What do they eat besides my
aloe vera plant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably the brown garden snail, Helix aspersa, says
entomology expert John Jackman, of Texas A&AMP;M Extension Service.
They eat almost anything and love humidity. Baits work to control
them, but so does a saucer of beer (they sip then drown). Snails
are hermaphroditic, having both male and female organs, which
explains why frequent mating is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just returned from an overseas Peace Corps assignment and
brought wood carvings home. Some are inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
How do I care for them?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Jones
</P>
<P>
   A: Less is more when dealing with pieces like yours, advises
Martha Grant from the Objects Conservator. Keep the wood out of
sunlight, dust with a soft brush or cloth without polish. Keep
curious hands off such items as body oils may cause damage.
Constant temperature and humidity forestall contraction and
expansion of the wood. A priceless item? Consider visiting with a
professional. Call the American Institute for Conservation of
Historic and Artistic Work at (202) 452-9545 for local
conservators. Q: We will be taking our grandson on his first
airplane trip this summer. The lady at the ticket counter told us
he would not need a photo ID. However, the tickets are printed
saying you must have a photo ID to board. Does he in fact need
this, and if so, what would you use for a 9-year-old? We will be
flying on American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your grandson won't have any problems. Only fliers 18 and
older are required to show a picture ID for domestic flights,
according to American Airlines. Of course, if you were taking him
abroad, he would need a passport. Consider having a consent for
medical treatment form completed by his parents. Send me a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to receive one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife was beneficiary of a life insurance policy from her
mother, who was an employee of the Ohio school system. The policy
was paid, but income tax was held out and had to be paid. I thought
life insurance was tax free. Is this a new policy of the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   _ Don M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally, life insurance benefits are not taxable, but there
are some exceptions, notes Stuart Bradfordof the Internal Revenue
Service. Was the life insurance policy through the Ohio school
system as opposed to one purchased independently from an insurer?
</P>
<P>
   Payments made ``by or for an employer because of an employee's
death'' are counted as income and are therefore taxable. For more
information, call (800) 829-1040. Ask for a copy of ``Your Federal
Income Tax,'' a k a Publication 17.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had my wife's minivan converted for wheelchair use, and the
by-product was a seat bench that will never fit in the van again.
It's gray fabric, and should fit in any 1998 Chrysler minivan. It's
free to a good home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Cantu
</P>
<P>
   A: Free is just about as good as it gets. If you can use this,
contact Cantu at fredcantu(at)hotmail.com.
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   More than one feline-ophile chastised me for not mentioning the
possibility of a medical condition causing a change in litter-box
use. Any major change in a pet's behavior should routinely trigger
a call or visit to the veterinarian. Stress, however, is often a
contributing factor in such behavioral changes.
</P>
<P>
   Family vacation time is rapidly approaching. Here is a tip from
reader Clark Stevens to help children on long flights. EarPlanes
(adult or children's sizes) moderate the effects of changing
pressure. While not recommended for infants, youngsters and those
with colds may experience relief. Pick up EarPlanes at area
retailers such as Eckerd Drugs and Walgreens, or order by calling
Cirrus Products at (800) EAR-6151.

 &HT;    Modern-day soothsayer: Weather sites predict future
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather this time of year can shift as often as a
four-cylinder car with an automatic transmission. And, in the
Midwest and South, there is the added danger of severe
thunderstorms and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   No list of weather-related Web sites should be attempted without
putting the Weather Channel right at the top of the list. The site
at www.weather.com gets more traffic than any other site devoted
entirely to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features of the site is the ability to customize the
start page so you'll immediately get the weather information you
need for the cities you care about most. You can also decide which
maps will appear and add other weather-related items such as travel
and airport information.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another contender that lacks some of the slickness
of the Weather Channel site yet offers some features that make it
unique on the Web. That's the Weather Underground site at
www.weatherunderground.com.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you can display the information in an incredible
number of languages. Just pick from a list that includes the ones
you'd expect plus some you might not expect _ Bulgarian and Slovak,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, including some things that you may not expect to
find on a weather site. For instance, click on the link labeled
astronomy and enter your ZIP code. You'll be able to see where the
stars and the planets will appear in the night sky in your part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The online edition of the USA Today newspaper also has an
excellent section devoted to the weather. Just go to
www.usatoday.com/weather/wfront.htm.
</P>
<P>
   While you're there, you may want to indulge in one of mankind's
favorite pastimes, talking about the weather. Just click on the
link called Talk Weather and complain to your heart's content. You
can also ask questions or even make your own predictions.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the official version of the weather _ and also
the place where most weather gathering organizations get primary
data _ there's only one choice: The National Weather Service.
You'll find that home page at www.nws.noaa.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll find a staggering amount of information. For
instance, you can click on the link called Web sites and find the
National Weather Service office for your area. In my case that's
the Atlanta office, which is really located in Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find that site at www.srh.noaa.gov/FFC.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers weather data rolled almost any way you'd like,
including links for short-term forecasts, long-term outlooks,
agricultural weather, and weather watches and warnings. You'll also
be able to learn the radio frequency for the Weather Service's
weather warning radio broadcasts for this area.
</P>
<P>
   People in my state also will enjoy a visit to the Georgia
Weather _ Automated Environmental Monitoring Network Page at
www.griffin.peachnet.edu/bae.
</P>
<P>
   This service was established in 1991 by the College of
Agriculture and Environmental Sciences of the University of
Georgia. Mostly the weather information seems to be intended for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The network has weather stations scattered across the state
where air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar
radiation, wind speed, wind direction and soil temperature at
various depths are monitored literally every second.
</P>
<P>
   Then the information gathered at the stations is dumped into a
master computer every 15 minutes. That compilation is used to
provide information to the Web site and researchers.

 &HT;    By combining paintings with digital images, high-tech executive
creates new kind of art
 &HT;    By Robert W. Gee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Zvi Yaniv isn't the typical artist. He's not the
typical physicist either.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks in staccato bursts and gestures in broad strokes as he
makes bold statements about the future of technology. He envisions
a world with wall-sized video displays and spends his days in a
mostly windowless office perfecting a prototype that he hopes will
make his dream a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's forget about putting a television in the wall. Let's
make the wall a television,'' says Yaniv, president and chief
operating officer of SI Diamond Technology, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At his home in the hills of West Austin, Yaniv retreats in bare
feet to his screened porch amid a rock garden and reflecting pools,
and he flips on his PC to create a new kind of art. He calls it
two-dimensional kinetic art.
</P>
<P>
   He programs a series of digital images _ either photos, other
artists' work or his own _ onto a flat panel, liquid crystal
display and inserts the panel into a rectangular hole that he has
cut in a painting or lithograph, not his own.
</P>
<P>
   A chip drives the display, flashing a series of images often
with a theme independent from the original work giving new meaning
to the art. The digital panel typically measures about 10 inches by
10 inches and the painting 2 feet by 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I combined art with the digital world,'' Yaniv says. ``It
gives the artist and the computer guy the power to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaniv, who is from Israel and moved to the United States in
1983, has created nine works of art, seven of which are on display
at the IC2 Institute in Austin. One is at Gallery Soco and the
other hangs in Yaniv's home.
</P>
<P>
   He holds a patent on the concept. His next work, he says, will
contain 3-D digital images and video display. He also will
collaborate with an Irish sculptor to incorporate the flat panel
displays into sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to launch a Web site that will allow users to make
virtual art by cutting a hole in a canvas and replacing it with
images of their own. He'd also like to use the concept for a
children's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with an idea and I want people to use it and use
it,'' he says, smiling widely. ``It gives people the freedom of
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his favorite works hang on the third floor of IC2. One is
called ``Conflict.'' The digital window, inserted in the center of
an abstract artwork by Linda Dumond, flashes a series of 10 images
that connect seamlessly with the lines of the painting, showing one
color growing into another, then retreating. ``I call it 'Conflict'
because it's a conflict between the blue area and the area it
conquers,'' Yaniv says.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite, ``Oasis,'' displays six frames of the sun
setting from The Oasis restaurant west of Austin. The digital
sunset becomes the focal point of the original work, in which a
pencil hovers near two broken orbs and two strawberries. A woman in
a black formal dress stands to the right of the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Another Yaniv work, ``Faces of the World,'' on display at IC2,
will be shipped to an art gallery in Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Yaniv has long collected art, and despite his giddiness over his
first foray into creating his own works, he emphasizes that he does
not consider himself an artist _ rather a facilitator of art.
</P>
<P>
   He recently made a special wedding display for some friends by
putting 47 images of the couple in various stages of youth and
adulthood on a flat panel in the corner of a larger picture of the
two at their wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You open a new dimension to the two-dimensional picture,''
Yaniv says. ``The idea is very simple . . . to combine art and
technology and make it one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   At one time a Mac-only piece of software thwarted by an
injunction, Connectix not only has had said injunction overturned,
but their Sony Playstation emulation application is now available
for the PC. Virtual Game Station ($30; www.connectix. com; for the
PC and Mac) gives high-end computer users access to some of the
best _ and worst _ Playstation games without owning a console.
Extremely demanding, CVGS is not recommended for low-end computer
owners as it fancies 3-D acceleration hardware and prefers a 400Mhz
processor or a G3 or G4 Mac. With such horsepower, however, the
software is stable and, once installed, instantly recognizes Sony
discs over regular CD-ROMs and launches automatically. Connectix
does not claim to emulate all Sony games and even the ones it does
accommodate won't necessarily run smoothly or accurately, but with
a fair-sized library of perfectly compatible games, CVGS does
``broaden consumer price,'' as it purports to intend, and allows
for Playstationing at work, during a long commute via one's laptop,
or at home when the TV isn't available.
</P>
<P>
   A light, airy, wind-wispy game by nature, Wilco Publishing's
Hangsim ($39; www.wilcopub.com; for the PC) is their first,
stand-alone flight simulator. More renowned for their add-on and
expansion packs to Microsoft's superlative Flight Simulator
franchise, Wilco has found a rarely treaded sim niche in hang
gliding. The gusty/breezy meteorological events and phenomena
represented in Hangsim seem accurate and appropriately daunting at
times; vast, beautiful aerial photography landscapes and the
variety of craft simulated -_ from basic hang glider to
para-gliders to ultralights _ all offer a great lazy game for the
sky pilot in all of us. A few glitches and graphic flaws are
forgivable considering the pace of wild blue yondering, though the
pace itself is sure to turn off many gamers. Nicely added features
such as HUDs, waypoint challenge and competition modes still don't
change the fact that Hangsim is all about blowing in the wind _
without actually stepping outdoors. That's just silly.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   A follow up to last year's surprise side-scrolling hit, Tomba 2:
The Evil Swine Return ($40; www.playstation. com; for the
Playstation) revisits the charming pink-haired caveman freak,
Tomba, as he once again sets himself up against a drove of
malevolent swine who have managed to kidnap his girlfriend, Tabby.
Like the original, Tomba 2 offers an engaging mix of seek and
baconize mission quests infused with quirky platform gameplay.
Character charm sets this game above other banal Mario Brothers
clones as it is decidedly lewd, a crassly sassy take on the ``jump
and squash, throw and duck, hop up, hop down, climb swing and
pounce'' genre. Moreover, RPG puzzle-solving elements and a 3-D-ish
feel in an otherwise 2-D environment give Tomba 2 a depth of play _
literal and figurative _ not attained by similar games.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   MadCatz has taken the deficient Sega Dreamcast controller and
corrected its flaws. The Dream Pad ($30; www.madcatz.com) has six
excellently placed, fully programmable buttons as opposed to the
scant four on Sega's default controller. It's also wide and
comfortable enough for adult-sized hands with two effective analog
shoulder triggers, a smooth analog thumbstick and a ``floating''
D-pad. The stylish, ergonomic Dream Pad also utilizes anti-slip
rubber gripper padding that keeps the controller comfortably in the
gamer's hands. In fact, Madcatz Dream Pad is superior in nearly
every way _ almost flawless, save for one nagging fault: The
controller programming button sits right where you're likely to
rest your thumb if you aren't pressing any of the action buttons.
An accidental brush of the program button in the middle of fast
action will suddenly disable all functions or reconfigure the
controller on the fly. Very frustrating. Other than that, perfect.
Madcatz saves Sega.
</P>
<P>
   A JOY STICK, MINUS THE JOY
</P>
<P>
   While InterAct's Cyclone Digital Joystick ($39;
www.interact-acc.com) offers an impressive list of features _ nine
programmable buttons, a hat switch, throttle slider, rotating
stick, USB and serial port connections, and a symmetrical button
splay that makes it lefty friendly (lefties unite!) _ the unit
still comes at a fair price. But there's a reason: The thing is
pretty much junk. The Cyclone's actual stick is so loose and floppy
that maintaining any form of control is almost impossible, and even
small movements lead to large changes in direction or lurches in
motion. In addition, the Cyclone's base is so small and light that
any excited movements result in the joystick sliding across your
desktop or toppling into you. Thus, what you've got here is a
peripheral that sorely misses the thrust of intuitive user
interfacing. Destined for the big joystick bargain bin in the sky.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   I've spent many a long day at the computer and endured a good
many thunderstorms; but it wasn't until recently when the two
events happened to coincide, fiercely, that the importance of
workstation surge protection came to the forefront of my mind. As
it turns out, there are roughly 17 trillion surge protectors on the
market, but I settled on the Recoton Home Office Surge Suppressor
with Phone Line Protection ($25; www.recoton.com) for its
reasonable price and versatility. The unit, which also acts as a
six-outlet power bar, protects one's system from a power surge of
up to 800 joules (bring it on, Zeus!). It works for both the power
supply and the phone/modem jack as well as the suppression of less
cataclysmic and more niggling electrical and radio frequency
transient noise. It's also complete with appropriate blinking
lights telling you just how fine a job it's doing. This particular
model comes with a $15,000 warranty on the product(s) it's
protecting, though only for five years.

 &HT;    Souping up computer takes just a few touches
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I was a young man, way too much of my time was
spent trying to get more speed and louder exhaust noises out of a
car that began life as a rather ordinary Chevrolet Chevelle.
</P>
<P>
   After I was done, it had more bolted-on equipment than a space
shuttle built from junkyard parts.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays cars aren't that big of a deal to me. Instead, I spend
just as much childish zeal and grown-up money hopping up my home
PC. From what I can tell, lots of folks are in that same boat.
Computers have taken the place of hot rods for those of us who
never quite grew up.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a lot of the stuff I do isn't really necessary. It's
just fun. Besides, it does speed up the computer, and as was true
with that red Chevelle, it pleases me in intangible ways. So come
along with me, we'll crawl under the hood of that PC of yours and
make a few minor changes.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Let's add a lot. Modern versions of Windows seem to
thrive on more memory. At one time, you ran into the law of
diminishing returns at 32 or 64 megabytes. But now, if you have
less than 128 megabytes of RAM, you can really add some life to
that old machine with more memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tweaking: Click on the Control Panel to open it, then open the
System icon. Click on the tab at the top of that window that says
Performance. Now select File System. Then _ under settings _ change
the setting that says ``typical role of this computer'' to Network
Server. Only do that if you have 128 megs or more of memory. This
change will let your PC use the memory you added more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Video: Next to adding system memory, the least expensive way to
speed up an existing computer is to add a video card with a lot of
video memory. My own video card has 32 megabytes of RAM (you can
probably pick one up for $120 or so), and there are a lot of
computer enthusiasts who argue that this change offers more
potential for speed than a faster processor. Here's why. Almost
everything about Windows is graphics. Your processor spends a lot
of energy managing all those little dots of light on your screen. A
souped-up video card takes on a lot of that processing work,
freeing your processor and letting it work faster.
</P>
<P>
   Defrag: Hey, this one is free. There's a program that comes free
with Windows called Disk Defragmenter. You'll find it under the
Start button by selecting Accessories, then System Tools. Run this
program at least once a week, and it'll organize your hard disk so
that programs load faster and run faster. The good thing about
Defragmenter is that it also organizes the programs on your disk so
that the ones you use more often load the fastest. So the longer
you run it, the better it learns your own habits and speeds things
up based on them.
</P>
<P>
   Internet: If you have the fastest computer in the world, one of
those 1-gigahertz speed demons, and a slow connection, then when
you are on the Web you have a slow computer. A middle-of-the-road
computer with a fast connection will run circles around it. Since
so many of us camp out on the Web these days, consider getting DSL
service from the telephone company or a cable modem from your cable
TV provider.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done all this, get some orange paint for the side of
your computer. It'll have earned its racing stripes.

 &HT;    Summer outlook _ big blows, blazing bark
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Florida has the best day-to-day weather
around, but the megaweather is a killer.
</P>
<P>
   People in other states speak nonchalantly about weather in the
easy short-term. They complain about a sudden late freeze in April.
We complain about oceanic-temperature cycles brewing monster
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   They whine about snow melting late. We talk about what
percentage of our forests will be aflame by August.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term picture here is, as always, mild and boring: high
in the 80s, low in the 70s, with a chance of afternoon showers. But
the big picture? Powerful hurricanes, wildfires, loss of coastline,
mobile-home-seeking tornadoes and the worst drought in more than a
half century.
</P>
<P>
   Microweather: gentle breezes on the coast. Megaweather:
forecasters announcing that this year's hurricane season will be as
bad or worse than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Weather reports in other states are filled with descriptions of
this week's air mass from Canada or a lingering low-pressure area.
Florida weather reports, in contrast, have an epic sweep. They tell
of year-long El Nina cycles, decades-long drought cycles and
100-year storms.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term, there's not a cloud in the sky. Long term: well,
global warming might raise the sea level and finally solve Miami's
political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even though spring has been a succession of warm days and
mildnights, the forecast for the summer is shaping up as bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered wild fires and drought punctuated by hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Doppler radar readings predict late morning frogs, clearing by
afternoon, followed by scattered evening locust.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane season predictions came from the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA is the
government agency that administers the atmosphere. Can't you tell
from the name? Last week, NOAA announced that under its
administration, at least 11 tropical storms will brew in the
Atlantic and Caribbean this year. Seven are expected to become
full-fledged hurricanes, three will become major hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The annual hurricane season prediction is one of those official
rituals that mark the changing seasons in nearly seasonless
Florida. Schoolchildren get restless for the end of the year, the
air conditioners click on, people plant in their yards and NOAA
tells us to brace for the upcoming hurricanes. Summer's almost
here.
</P>
<P>
   With official spokesman-style understatement, the NOAA people
say we will experience what they call ``an unusually active
hurricane season.'' That means people fleeing to high ground,
boarding up houses and listening to reporters in very cool rain
slickers yelling above the pounding surf on The Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   There are families that still have boxes of C-size batteries and
garages cluttered with plywood and bottled water from last year's
</P>
<P>
   ``unusually active hurricane season.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason NOAA expects things to turn out this way is La Nina,
a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean. It's lasting longer than it
</P>
<P>
   should. The pattern occurs when ocean temperatures are unusually
cold.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening at the same time Atlantic temperatures are
unusually warm. Add to this the prevailing winds east across the
Atlantic, factor in the sudden drop in the Nasdaq, take into
account, Pedro Martinez's 67 strikeouts this season, and the
computer model will tell you to invest in plywood futures because
big winds are going to blow.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the outlook for summer:
</P>
<P>
   Warm and lazy days with the smells of outdoor grills and flaming
pine trees wafting through the air.
</P>
<P>
   That warm feeling of parched lawn crunching under your bare
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying the quiet that descends on the neighborhood during a
heat-wave-induced power outage.
</P>
<P>
   The simple pleasure of sitting on the porch listening to the
sounds of neighbors hammering plywood sheets over their windows
while the tiny speakers of weather radios honk their warnings in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the crowd at the beach and at the last store that hasn't
yet run out of batteries and duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's the most wonderful season of the year.

 &HT;    Women totally at home on Web
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always amusing to read those ``gee whiz''
articles in newspapers and magazines marveling at the fact there
are so many women starting up Internet companies, designing and
producing Web sites and actually using the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most stories about wired women make it sound as if we had just
won the vote, when nothing could be further from the truth. If you
are a woman and have a computer, you can go online, e-mail your
mom, order books or even play fantasy baseball. And millions of
women do these things every day.
</P>
<P>
   The annual media excitement about women online always seems odd
to me, because I happen to be one of those women who was somehow
able to find my way to a computer and log on to the Internet about
six years ago without any trouble whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Amazon.com, eBay, Webvan and my close personal friends
at Visa will all tell you their accounting departments just love me
and all the other wired women (and men) who know how to click that
``submit'' button.
</P>
<P>
   With a telephone assist from my best friend Janet, I even
installed a newer, faster modem one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid,'' she said as she coached me through the
installation process. ``It's just a piece of metal.'' And she was
right. Going online is not rocket science, and more and more women
are discovering this, which is good news for the Web and all the
people who write and produce content and commerce for it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the runaway success of Salon's ``Mothers Who Think''
daily columns (www.salon.com) written by ordinary women talking
about ordinary things like parenting and the struggle to balance
work and family. (``Mothers Who Think'' became so popular that
there's now a hardcover collection available from Amazon.com or the
local bookstore.) Sites like iVillage (www.ivillage) and relative
newcomer Oxygen (www.oxygen.com) also cater to an audience of wired
women who want to do more than check stock quotes or read the
paper. Wired women tend to use the Web to communicate and to learn
more about the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   A new study from the Pew Internet and American Life project
released last week shows that women are going online not to isolate
themselves but to stay close to the people and issues that concern
them.
</P>
<P>
   The study (www.pewinternet.org), designed to get an accurate
reading of how the Net impacts the lives of average Americans, was
based on a daily poll of Internet users asking what they did not
just that day only, but the previous day as well, when recent Web
adventures were fresh in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The findings reveal that more than 9 million women have gone
online for the first time in the last six months and that these
women are far from alienated, isolated computer addicts. For women,
the Internet is an enriching experience that enables them to stay
in touch with family and friends around the corner and around the
world. The new crop of online women has reshaped America's social
landscape, the study says, because women have used e-mail to enrich
their important relationships and enlarge their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has the opposite of an isolating effect on these
users,'' the study said. ``They report that e-mail has helped them
improve their connections to relatives and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Pew study, there are millions of women who log
on every day just to chat with faraway friends and relatives.
Several women I know, myself included, have been able to maintain
long-distance relationships with family and friends that never
would have survived if letter writing, birthday cards and phone
calls were the only means of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than men,'' the study says, ``women say they are attached
to e-mail and pleased with how it helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when women are done sending and reading e-mail, they do
go online to search for information. Here, the Pew Study says, the
Web sites women visit most are very different from the sites men
visit. Women are more likely to seek health and religious
information, research new jobs and play games online. Men are more
likely to get news and financial information, trade stocks,
participate in online auctions, shop, access government Web sites
and search for sports news.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't necessarily a situation that needs to be corrected,
and the Pew study does not suggest that it should. Everyone has
different interests, and they go to the Web sites that address
them,interests, whether it's the stock market or online grocery
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But the study does note that Web veterans who have been online
for three years or longer know their way around the Web and a wider
variety of sites that reflect that experience. The main point that
should be taken away from the study is that women are online,
surfing the Web for communication, utility and fun.
</P>
<P>
   MaybeNow might be time to stop all the ``golly gee'' noise about
women on the Web and just get used to the fact that women are
online right alongside the boys.

 &HT;    Starving again
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Very few of us can imagine what it means to be truly
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   We know how it feels when lunch is late or there's no snack
after school. But we have no clue how it feels to eat less than we
need for months on end. We can't conceive of going days eating
nothing, until our arms are no bigger than sticks, our bodies are
weakened by diarrhea, and there is nothing to do but lie down on
the ground and die.
</P>
<P>
   That is happening to hundreds of people, including children, who
live in an area called the Horn of Africa. The Horn is a point of
land on the eastern side of the continent that juts into the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that unless help from other countries arrives fast,
between 8 million and 12 million people could face starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The worst problem is in Ethiopia, where 8 million people may
starve. But hunger also haunts people in parts of neighboring
countries, including Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Famine _ widespread hunger and starvation _ usually has more
than one cause. During normal times, the people in Ethiopia are
some of the poorest in the world. Some eat only what they can grow.
Others are wandering herders who live off their cattle, sheep or
goats. Nearly half the people in the country live on less than $1 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   The country is an extremely dry place. Farmers use old-fashioned
methods. They do not have the ability to pipe water to their land.
When the rains do not come, as has happened in Ethiopia for the
past three years, people cannot grow crops to eat. Pastures dry up,
leaving nothing for animals to eat, and they die.
</P>
<P>
   War has made the problem worse. For two years, Ethiopia and
Eritrea have fought over where the border between the two countries
should be. Each government spends about $1 million a day on its
military. That is money that instead could feed many of the people
who now go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Famine has devastated the area before. The rains fail every few
years, and wars often flare up. There was a famine in 1973. And
during a famine in 1984 and 1985, about 1 million Ethiopians died.
But help from people in other countries, including the United
States, saved millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``humanitarian'' agencies _ organizations that assist people
in trouble _ say the rest of the world needs to help again. Some
people argue that other countries shouldn't help because the
governments spend money on war instead of food. But other people
say the people who are suffering have nothing to do with the war.
</P>
<P>
   War or no war, humanitarian workers say, help is needed so
children and their parents don't go hungry _ really hungry

 &HT;    Fire ravages Los Alamos
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   One thousand firefighters in New Mexico struggled last week to
control a blaze that was set on purpose by the National Park
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service started the fire May 4 to clear brush at the
Bandelier National Monument, which is near the town of Los Alamos
(where the atomic bomb was developed in the 1940s). Controlled
burns often are used by the Park Service to prevent worse forest
fires later. But this fire raged out of control in the dry, windy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The fire sliced through 20,000 acres and destroyed about 260
homes and damaged 20 others. About 25,000 people were evacuated,
and 150 National Guard members were called in to maintain order and
prevent looting.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGES DEBATE ELIAN'S FATE
</P>
<P>
   Three judges must decide if a child as young as Elian Gonzalez,
6, understands enough to seek asylum in the United States.
``Asylum'' means ``safe refuge.'' If Elian is granted asylum, he
will be protected by America and won't have to return to Cuba as
his father wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government says Elian's father speaks for him and
therefore the boy shouldn't be considered for asylum. A federal
judge agreed, but Elian's American relatives asked the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which is a higher court, to reconsider
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is located in Atlanta.
The three judges are expected to rule in a few weeks. That decision
might not be final, however, because the losing side could appeal
again.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATORS CLOSE TO FLAG DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina House and Senate are ironing out final
details of a bill that would remove the Confederate flag from atop
the state capitol. The flag would be repositioned nearby at a
Confederate monument on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill differs slightly from the one already passed by
the Senate. The House, for example, calls for the flag to be flown
on a 30-foot pole but the Senate specifies a 20-foot pole. The two
houses must agree on details like those before a flag bill can be
sent to the governor for his final approval.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges has said he would sign any bill the
Legislature passed to remove the flag.

 &HT;    Society pays the price for youths' entitlement
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In California, Steven Vincent Bell laughed
out loud when a county judge invoked the ``three strikes and you're
out'' law and sentenced him to 35-years-to-life in prison for
stealing a bicycle. Even ``60 Minutes'' got into the act and
elevated the thief to national fame as a result of what they felt
to be a prime-time example of judicial folly.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, after all, it was only his third residential burglary,
and he'd only stolen a bicycle worth $300. Maybe the authorities
should have cut him a little slack. Maybe he's not a real thief.
Maybe he's just a slow learner, and being busted twice already for
housebreaking wasn't enough to get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang in there, everybody,'' the thief shouted to the courtroom
as he was being shown out _ in shackles. ``We'll be back to see
these losers another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's he calling losers?
</P>
<P>
   According to teens who show up in my friend Gail's courtroom, a
judge out on the Oregon coast, folks who obey laws and live within
the framework of social responsibility are losers and when asked to
defend their thieving ways, the young bandits candidly explain.
``Because I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two or three years ago, the social studies teacher across the
hall from my classroom decided to run a survey on her 8th-graders'
values. The results were scary. All but 9 of the students felt it
was okay to take something (they avoided the word ``steal'') if
they really wanted it and couldn't get it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Because they really wanted it? That predicates entitlement?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of nights ago, Gail was filling me in on a situation in
her neighborhood. It seems a band of teenagers are roaming that
beachfront community at night, stealing boats from folks' yards,
and selling them for drug money. Then when the boat owners complain
to the police of being left high and dry, these morally-challenged
thugs feel it is perfectly within their rights to terrorize the
victims for their grievous acts. A neighbor two houses down, has
become a virtual prisoner in her home since reporting her boat
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   To most of us, theft is an incomprehensible act. We were taught
not to take what doesn't belong to us _ period. But lately there
seems to have been a shift in attitudes _ it's not okay to steal
from a friend, the kids tell us, but it is okay to knock over
Wal-Mart for some jeans and jelly sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Like that clown in California, they just don't get it either.
</P>
<P>
   In Mr. Bell's case, breaking and entering is an avoidable
situation. Crowbars and picklocks don't just jump into our hands
without warning. Joints don't get cased by accident. There's no
reason for this guy not to have figured it out the first time. He
breaks in. He's caught. Why isn't that enough of an indication to
him that what he has done is unacceptable, illegal, and will
eventually land his lawbreaking backside in a cell?
</P>
<P>
   But our guy perseveres and repeats the process, and then when
he's caught and convicted a third time, he has the absurd nerve to
scream FOUL and call his jury ``losers.'' This guy needs to be in
custody to protect himself from his own stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way he's right. We are the losers. We're the ones
paying the taxes to fill the belly of the jerk who stole our
bicycle.

   ATLANTA _ Dear Sue and Jacki: I can't find a good answer to why
I can't open many downloads, both photos and text files. Often, all
I get is ``gobbledygook'' symbols. Is software available that will
``read'' all these?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack D.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: These days there are so many graphic and text file types.
You may be able to open one and not another. Take a look at your
browser preferences. In Netscape, go to Navigator/Applications.
You'll see a list of file types and applications. Make sure the
file type you're opening is listed with an application that will
open it. If it is, double-click to make sure the file type
information is correct. In Explorer, refer to the Receiving
files/File Helper preference. Double-click the format to make sure
it's configured properly.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Try to open graphics and text documents in a browser
window. Simply download the file and drop it into your browser.
Voila! The file can be viewed. Browsers have format limitations,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: PC users might want to try Pad. It's freeware. It opens
text and graphics. For Mac viewers, look at DoItAllText or
RealView, $25 shareware. Download them from CNet.com. There may be
garble at the top, but scroll down to see the ``real'' text. They
do a nice job on graphics. DoItAllText even lets you view movies.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki: What can you tell me about the i-opener?
</P>
<P>
   _ William D., Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It's a 5-pound gadget that fits anywhere. Billed as an
Internet ``appliance,'' the i-opener could go in your kitchen but
isn't a toaster. It's an out-of-the-box, flip-up-the-screen,
plug-and-play way to hit the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Internet service, browser and e-mail are ready to go. It
has e-mail and Web access _ that's all. Its goal is to connect with
the technophobe and appeal to PC households wanting a mini-Web
cruiser in another room.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: It has two components: A 10-inch flat screen and a
keyboard. The i-opener uses a 56k modem (broadband's next). It
shares your phone line but claims it won't hog it. Information
channels bring you news, weather, sports, financial, etc. Get this,
a Pizza button points you to a pizza delivery place.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: The i-opener costs $99 until Father's Day. After that,
it's $199. You can buy a mouse and printer, too. Internet access is
$21.95 a month. Buy from Netpliance (www.netpliance.com/) or
Circuit City and CompUSA, although it's big-time on back order.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Want a real eye-opener? You're locked into the i-opener's
Internet service. Also, you must activate the service within 30
days and buy it for at least 90 consecutive days. If you violate
the terms of sale, there's a $499 termination fee.

APPEALS COURT QUESTIONS USE OF PEPPER SPRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peaceful anti-logging protesters, who had pepper spray
blasted into their eyes at close range, won another chance to sue
the law enforcement agencies and officials involved _ nearly three
years after the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1997, the protesters filed a lawsuit claiming that
the application of pepper spray to the eyelids and faces of
nonviolent protesters constitutes excessive and unreasonable force
in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed the lower federal district court judge's decision against
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said that only a jury can decide whether the
force used against the protesters to effect their arrest was
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, at three separate locations, law
enforcement officials of Humboldt County and the city of Eureka,
Calif., used pepper spray against nonviolent and unarmed young
women and men who were protesting the logging of old-growth
redwoods in the Headwaters Redwood Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper spray, sometimes called oleoresin capsicum (OC) after its
active ingredient, is derived from hot peppers. When applied to the
eyes, it has an immediate and painful burning effect that may last
for hours, even after dousing the eyes with water. It swells the
eyes shut and makes it difficult to breathe. Medical studies show
it can cause asthmatics to convulse and die.
</P>
<P>
   A protester called the pain caused by the pepper spray, ``the
worst pain I have ever experienced in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of these incidents, four women protesters entered former
Congressman Frank Riggs' Eureka office. Riggs supported the
logging. The women dropped wood chips on the floor and chained
themselves together in a circle with heavy steel cylinders over
their arms.
</P>
<P>
   The police video tape of how law enforcement treated these
protesters tells the story in chilling and vivid detail.
</P>
<P>
   With cold deliberateness, a deputy sheriff dips a Q-tip into a
cup filled with pepper spray. He walks slowly over to 16-year-old
Maya Portugal, who is sitting quietly with a soft, brown hat on her
head. A city police officer forces Maya's head back and pries open
her right eye. The wet Q-tip is swept across her lower eyelid. The
girl stifles a sob. The officers repeat the process on her left
eye. She shakes her head as if to dislodge the intense pain.
</P>
<P>
   The officers crouch as they shuffle over to the next woman in
the circle. The men show no anger. Their actions are calculated and
purposeful. The eyes of all four women are swabbed with pepper
spray.
</P>
<P>
   The women still refuse to unchain themselves. Then the officers
select one of the women, Terri Slanetz, and tell her they will use
a direct spray. She pleads, ``Why are you using chemical weapons on
us? You have other options.'' To no avail. A police officer pulls
her head back by her ponytail. And a deputy sheriff leans over her
and shoots pepper spray directly into her closed left eye, from a
distance of not more than four inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other options'' is precisely why the court of appeals reversed
the lower court's ruling. Law enforcement officials had numerous
other options, the appellate court pointed out. Officers could have
cut through the steel sleeves joining the protesters with a Makita
grinder as had been done safely hundreds of times before. Officers
did not attempt to negotiate with the protesters, did not attempt
to wait them out, nor did they attempt to physically remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the county sheriff's office and the city police
department used pepper spray on the peaceful demonstrators _ in
violation of their own general orders and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Humboldt County's general order concerning oleoresin capsicum
states, in part: ''This aerosol is furnished as a defensive weapon
for the protection of department members ... and is intended for
use in those cases wherein a member of the Department is attempting
to subdue an attacker or a violently resisting suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eureka Police Department's policy states: ``OC shall not be
used to harass or punish a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the California Department of Justice ``recommends that
Oleoresin Capsicum be used only against violent or hostile
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted repeatedly in its decision that the
demonstrators posed no threat to the police, to the themselves, or
to the public at large. Most of the protesters were women. Not one
was armed. All were passive in their protests. None of the
protesters offered active resistance to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Humboldt County and Eureka law enforcement officials claim they
used pepper spray merely as a ``pain compliance technique'' to get
the cooperation of the protesters. The appeals court nixed that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision of the three-member court states: ``a
'pain compliance technique' using pepper spray does not permit the
police immediately to stop inflicting pain the moment the
protesters comply with the officers' demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court stressed that the only crime the nonviolent
protesters had committed was trespass, and that ``militates against
finding the force used to effect an arrest reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading the court records closely leaves the impression that the
police intended to inflict pain _ immediate and sustained, severe
pain _ because they were frustrated with the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Ninth Circuit Court decision gives fair warning to law
enforcement agencies in the nine western states and territories
under its jurisdiction that they had better discourage the use of
chemical sprays against peaceful demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The court concludes that only a jury can decide, according to
the facts in these incidents, whether reasonable force was used to
effect the arrest of the protesters. Therefore, the protesters have
a right to sue the law enforcement officials in a federal district
court _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mark Hughes of Denver, Colo., who handled the appeal
for the protesters says the court has upheld the American tradition
of civil disobedience. ``It is one of the very fundamental rights
that the founders of the country wanted to preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, will law enforcement agencies pay attention?

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID SCHNEIDER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In appreciating the great contributions to world
civilization, you have to think about China. Silk, bronze casting,
tea, porcelain, calligraphy and the magnetic compass. Perhaps,
though, we could have done without the gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   Three Chinese philosophies are simply inspiring: the moral law
of man and the goodness that binds human relationships espoused by
Confucius; the harmony between nature and man propounded by Lao Tzu
in the Tao Te Ching; and ``Chen Ai,'' or universal or all-embracing
love, advocated by Mo Tzu.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the imagination is staggered by the problems and
challenges of governing China, with its immense population in
excess of 1.2 billion, its constant floods and environmental
difficulties, along with the country's transition to at least a
partial market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, you have to wonder why Beijing's leaders behave the way
they do, making a mockery of Confucius, Lao Tzu and Mo Tzu; you
have to wonder what we can or should do about it.
</P>
<P>
   China has made the Tibetans a minority in their own country.
Tibetan Buddhist lamas, monks and nuns have been tortured or
killed. And China's government refuses to negotiate with the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader and a recipient of the Nobel Peace
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that China is damaging Tibet ecologically through
strip-mining, deforestation and nuclear waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   And China has made Tibet a militarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. State Department's ``China Country Report
on Human Rights Practice for 1999'' published earlier this year,
Chinese authorities continue to commit serious human rights abuses
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   In China itself, state authorities have arrested more than
10,000 members of the Falun Gong and restricted the rights of
Catholics and Protestants. And remember the Tiananmen Square
massacre?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., cites evidence that China has also
broken every trade agreement it has entered into.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, China signed agreements that it would not use forced
labor, but in its 1998 report, the State Department said China
ignored or denied cases of forced labor identified by U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
   China has expanded into Tibet for much the same reasons that
Germany in 1939 expanded into various parts of Europe; it wants
some Lebensraum (some living room) and is claiming that Tibet was
part of China, much as the Germans claimed that a great deal of
Europe had been part of Germany. Never mind that Tibetans are,
well, Tibetan!
</P>
<P>
   (Of course to be fair, we did much the same thing to American
Indian nations when we conquered the West for the good old USA. I'm
sure American Indians can relate to the horror of the spiritual and
cultural destruction of Tibet.)
</P>
<P>
   With China we have delinked respect for human rights and trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there is such a controversy now about the crucial
vote in the House of Representatives at the end of May for
extending to China ``permanent normal trade relations'' (or PNTR,
previously known as the ``most favored nation'' status). The
Clinton administration, backed by heavy Republican support, wants
PNTR for China.
</P>
<P>
   What many in Congress desire is the opportunity to review
China's human rights conduct every year. That is the situation now.
Once PNTR is enacted for China, Congress loses that right.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing defeat for the legislation, some members of Congress _
led by Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich. _ propose a compromise. It is
backed by the Clinton administration and by former President George
Bush. The compromise would mean approval of PNTR for China, but it
would set up an advisory committee, appointed by Congress and the
president, to monitor human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory?
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be yet another layer of bureaucracy that affects
the traditional role of congressional review.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it easier to just read the State Department's twice-yearly
human rights report on China?
</P>
<P>
   Free trade really means there are no rules. Fair trade means a
balance, including responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should vote in favor of fair trade and vote no on
``permanent normal trade relations.'' Perhaps it will help China to
act in accordance with its ancient values. And maybe it will be
good for us not to kowtow to a big bully.

&HT;     GIULIANI THE HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For one day anyway, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has never seemed so attractive a human being.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in front of a small group of City Hall reporters,
searching and stumbling his way into a long overdue admission about
his ruined marriage, Giuliani faced the world with a raw,
heavy-hearted vulnerability that becomes an arrogant man.
</P>
<P>
   It distinguished him from all the other holier-than thou,
family-values-spewing Republicans who have been exposed as
hypocrites.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican Reps. Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston and Newt
Gingrich, and Sen. Dan Burton were so revealed, each was about as
attractive as a 3-week-old corpse found at the bottom of a
Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   This is because, unlike Giuliani last Wednesday, the Capitol
Hill foursome were devoid of humility or any public posture that
resembled genuine remorse or regret. Defiantly, haughtily, each man
appeared to be sorry only that his misdeed had been found out by
the hated news media.
</P>
<P>
   (Hyde added insult to injury, as well as to basic human
intelligence, by characterizing his five-year-long extramarital
affair with a married woman, conducted while he was in his mid-40s,
as ``a youthful indiscretion.'')
</P>
<P>
   For one day, the customarily defiant and haughty Giuliani did no
such thing.
</P>
<P>
   In what New York Times reporter Elisabeth Bumiller called ``an
extraordinary, emotional news conference,'' the second-term mayor
turned a regular press briefing into ``an unusually intimate
confessional.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani has been roundly blasted in retrospect for
blindsiding his estranged wife with public acknowledgment of their
doomed marriage, Bumiller wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unclear whether Mr. Giuliani had planned beforehand to
announce the possible separation at the news conference, or whether
he wandered into the remarks as reporters questioned him. Since the
mayor learned he has prostate cancer, he has become increasingly
personal and introspective in his news briefings.''
</P>
<P>
   This supports what most people with a life-threatening disease
will tell you: The experience has a potent way of clearing all the
superfluous clutter from one's personal dinner table. Priorities
shift dramatically; the trivial and disingenuous fall to the bottom
of the list.
</P>
<P>
   As the clean, awesome truth of mortality establishes itself
front and center, keeping up false ``appearances'' becomes a
wasteful and useless indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, the most impressive of Giuliani's ``confessions''
were not the references to his broken marriage to Donna Hanover or
to his relationship with a ``very good friend,'' Judith Nathan.
Rather it was his answer to whether he was concerned about a
political backlash to his personal travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you know, I don't really care about politics right now,''
he said. ``I don't. I'm thinking about my family, the people that I
love and what's, what can be done that's honest and truthful and
that protects them the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about politics. I'm not; politics comes at
least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all
work itself out some way, politically . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause _ be it prostate cancer, too many accidental
shooting victims of the police, a busted marriage, or all of the
above _ something wonderful and refreshing happened to Giuliani the
day he uttered those words.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of maintaining his stance as a smug, dispassionate,
grudge-holding autocrat, he donned the mantle of deeply humbled,
struggling, responsibility-taking human.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he even stopped blaming journalists for his problems.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the media had ``caused'' the damage to Giuliani's
marriage, the mayor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the media makes the damage much worse; it didn't cause the
damage. I take responsibility for everything I've done. And you
have every right to ask me, and I have a right to answer or not
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the confessional, Giuliani was back to his old
ways. When he wanted to talk about a food drive and reporters
wanted to talk about his wife's accusations of another ``other
woman,'' the mayor ``berated reporters,'' according to Bumiller,
and returned ``to his more combative, and familiar, public
persona.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he had come to agree with Nelson Warfield, one of
Giuliani's longtime critics within the Republican Party.
Pooh-poohing the notion that all the public laundry hanging could
humanize the mayor's image and help him in his U.S. Senate fight
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Warfield told the Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this helps. It's mere happy talk to suggest it
humanizes him. Nobody needs to be humanized this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, centuries of history indicate otherwise. Often, real
grace comes only after a spectacularly messy, humanizing fall.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, Rudolph Giuliani seemed to be reaching for that
grace. Had he continued, he might have been on the path to winning
a far greater prize than a seat in the U.S. Senate:
</P>
<P>
   His soul.

&HT;     DOWN IN THE DUMPSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Horse trading'' will be associated with San
Francisco journalism for years to come, the way ``expletive
deleted'' is associated with Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go sell it to the Chronicle.'' That's the Ben Bradlee
character's dismissive line in the 1976 movie ``All the President's
Men,'' and it stuck the way ``horse trading'' will now.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just because I'm a San Francisco columnist who wishes
he was wilder, but I always liked the wildness of earlier
generations of San Francisco journalists, including the antics of
William Randolph Hearst and legendary Chronicle Editor Scott
Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``horse trading'' were used by lawyer Joseph M. Alioto
in Clint Reilly's lawsuit to keep the Hearst Corp. from buying the
San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   When Alioto asked San Francisco Examiner Publisher Tim White if
he had been ``horse trading'' editorial page favors with the mayor
at lunch, White said he had.
</P>
<P>
   White, a man who was generally well-respected at both the
Examiner and the Chronicle (which he was due to take over), was
suspended from his job. Since then, everyone else here has had a
hard time focusing on their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer at the Federal Building said to me last week,
``Being in the spotlight isn't pleasant, is it? Now you see what
it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after White was suspended, I was standing with a friend
in front of the Examiner building when a man stopped and confronted
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner ought to be ashamed of itself,'' he said, and
point by point told us why. He was a newspaper reader, and he felt
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking a lot about this at work,'' he said. ``We're
probably not going to buy the Examiner again.''
</P>
<P>
   My colleague and I had nothing to say in response.
</P>
<P>
   If we hadn't been so tired and confused, to use another suddenly
popular phrase, there were a lot of things we could have said.
</P>
<P>
   We could have said that our publisher's lunches with the mayor
don't affect what we do in the newsroom. We could have pointed to
the Examiner's investigation of San Francisco's minority
contracting, which has propelled a continuing FBI investigation and
led to U.S. grand jury indictments.
</P>
<P>
   I could have said that I'm the guy who so infuriated the mayor
that he said he wouldn't use the Examiner as toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   The man berating us wasn't in the mood to hear how tough we'd
been on the mayor. He was angry about ``horse trading.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner is dying, and it can't even die with
dignity. Even the president of the Hearst Corp., Frank Bennack,
showed no attachment to the newspaper that was the beginning of
William Randolph Hearst's empire.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his courtroom testimony, Bennack mentioned the
Hearst-owned Houston Chronicle. He said to the judge, ``We like
Chronicles, your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I'm more upset than this column sounds. But I'm kind
of burned out and need to save my energy for deeper humiliations to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I spent three days in the courtroom, and it wasn't
pretty. These are just a few things I heard about the Examiner, all
spoken by Hearst's own witnesses and executives.
</P>
<P>
   We're not world-class, and neither is the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we knew that. Everyone knew that. But Bennack, a no-nonsense
witness, came right out and said so.
</P>
<P>
   You have to face your failings, and boy, have our failings been
shoved in our faces lately.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind that Bennack said he didn't know if Examiner
columnists are world-class columnists, because he doesn't have time
to read all his columnists every day.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose he'll read this, though.
</P>
<P>
   We're a failing newspaper. We knew that too. We're even failing
at going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   We always thought we were successful at a few things, however,
like keeping a watch on Mayor Willie Brown and his dealings.
</P>
<P>
   We continue to do that, while the mayor continues to run San
Francisco as his wholly owned subsidiary. You can even feel his
reach in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Brown must be laughing all the way to the next party, enjoying
the sweetest of revenge on this newspaper. Second-sweetest, after
Clint Reilly's.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, one more small wound among the gut-shots we took in
court. We found out we're garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper economist James N. Rosse was asked to explain the
meaning of a ``negative purchase price,'' specifically the $66
million Hearst wants to pay the Fang family to take the Examiner
off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rosse, a witness called by Hearst, said it's a fee like
``garbage disposal,'' paying someone to take away stuff you don't
want.
</P>
<P>
   Once we were proud to line parakeet cages. Now we're being taken
to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   No respect. No dignity. No recycling bin. We're garbage.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's better than the way I feel right now.

<P>
   It seems odd. The Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges are
traveling the world seeking alliances, while at the same time
struggling with technology demands and aggressive competitors at
home.
</P>
<P>
   But both domestic stock markets now find it essential to make
themselves into organizations on which the sun doesn't set. Their
haste is born of the very real penetration of automated trading,
which when applied to overseas markets creates a platform for
24-hour trading across time zones and national borders.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic trading systems already have displayed their power in
the U.S., pushing beyond normal trading hours, for instance. Now,
as some of these systems line up for full-exchange status, the
established powers of the Nasdaq and the NYSE are trying to ensure
they, rather than the upstarts, become the U.S. link to the growing
international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, so far, has been more aggressive than the NYSE, setting
up operations or links with exchanges in Osaka, Japan; Quebec,
Canada; Hong Kong and Europe. In Europe, it will be part of the
planned iX exchange. The iX will trade technology stocks from
Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse and blue-chips from the London Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE has, in the past, been content to let foreign listings
come to New York, but a Wall Street Journal story Wednesday says it
also is discussing several links to exchanges overseas. (A Big
Board spokesman confirmed the talks.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasdaq and other exchanges have realized they are businesses,
not just clubs,'' says Ian Domowitz, a Penn State finance professor
and electronic trading expert. ``Nasdaq isn't necessarily
neglecting business at home, it's changing the business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Nasdaq and NYSE have been victims of domestic
insurgency. The Big Board's largest members pushed it to rescind
Rule 390, which will let other exchanges trade NYSE-listed stocks.
The Nasdaq has seen electronic communications networks morph from
simple automated trading systems to being on the brink of becoming
full-blown exchanges, while taking volume. The two exchanges also
are readying themselves to shift to trading stocks in decimals
instead of fractions, something regulators are pushing but the
Nasdaq isn't ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, some observers worry about the two markets'
overseas overtures, especially in the case of the stretched Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong with making overtures as long as
it's not the Nasdaq's first priority,'' says Lee Korins, head of
the Security Traders Association, an industry trade group. ``The
priority should be to build the most efficient market here in the
U.S. because once it becomes a public company, a lot of people are
going to take shots at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two exchanges also believe they have little choice but
to expand overseas. ``We believe the world is shifting its focus
from national markets to global markets,'' says Alfred Berkeley,
the Nasdaq Stock Market's president. ``We're playing for the next
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Nasdaq's case, the bigger you can make the network, the
more liquidity you'll have,'' adds Penn State's Domowitz. ``Nasdaq
needs the ability to compete along two dimensions: liquidity and
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is this: Any exchange that wants to succeed will have
to ensure access to international investors and give its U.S.
members access to international listings. That's the liquidity
angle: making sure when a Duetsche Boerse member firm wants to
trade Intel, it can do so in Intel's most liquid market _ the
Nasdaq, according to Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Nasdaq's success overseas, it's had problems at
home. It rankled Congress when it successfully petitioned the
Securities and Exchange Commission to roll back its deadline for
switching trading to decimals from fractions. A Nasdaq spokesman
says its decimal testing worked, but the software to make it happen
ate up 98 percent of its computer capacity. Now it's trying to
restructure the software by 2001's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, ECNs have told regulators and Congress they
can fill that void and begin trading in decimals immediately, which
puts more pressure on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley points out that the Nasdaq's international moves and
its domestic technology operations are run separately and that
there were ``no restraints'' on the resources available to the
decimalization team.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Nasdaq has forged a pact with the government of
Quebec to establish Nasdaq Canada, but it may still strike a deal
with the Toronto Stock Exchange, another automated exchange. The
Quebec arrangement won't dissuade the Toronto exchange from further
discussions with Nasdaq, Barbara Stymiest, that exchange's
president, said in a press release last week. But the Toronto
exchange also is flirting with the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The risk-reward situation in Europe is slightly more
complicated, with exchanges across the continent seeking to join
the new iX. The exchanges there are bigger, the automated trading
systems faster and the volume heavier than in markets like Mexico
or Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse
probably decided it was better to link up on their own terms,
rather than have less appealing terms dictated to them later.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. exchanges are taking steps to make sure
they're players in whatever shakes out. ``I don't think we are
fully cognizant of the changes direct access to the market will
bring or their impact on the business,'' says Korins. ``What we're
seeing here is not a change for a couple of years, it's a change of
major proportion.''

switching trading to decimals from fractions. A Nasdaq spokesman
says its decimal testing worked, but the software to make it happen
ate up 98 percent of its computer capacity. Now it's trying to
restructure the software by 2001's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, ECNs have told regulators and Congress they
can fill that void and begin trading in decimals immediately, which
puts more pressure on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley points out that the Nasdaq's international moves and
its domestic technology operations are run separately and that
there were ``no restraints'' on the resources available to the
decimalization team.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Nasdaq has forged a pact with the government of
Quebec to establish Nasdaq Canada, but it may still strike a deal
with the Toronto Stock Exchange, another automated exchange. The
Quebec arrangement won't dissuade the Toronto exchange from further
discussions with Nasdaq, Barbara Stymiest, that exchange's
president, said in a press release last week. But the Toronto
exchange also is flirting with the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The risk-reward situation in Europe is slightly more
complicated, with exchanges across the continent seeking to join
the new iX. The exchanges there are bigger, the automated trading
systems faster and the volume heavier than in markets like Mexico
or Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse
probably decided it was better to link up on their own terms,
rather than have less appealing terms dictated to them later.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the U.S. exchanges are taking steps to make sure
they're players in whatever shakes out. ``I don't think we are
fully cognizant of the changes direct access to the market will
bring or their impact on the business,'' says Korins. ``What we're
seeing here is not a change for a couple of years, it's a change of
major proportion.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   One of the startling things about Shirley Beresford's research
is that it isn't considered startling anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford, an epidemiology professor at the University of
Washington, is a principal investigator with the Women's Health
Initiative, which is tracking the health of 162,000 post-menopausal
women, making it the largest project dealing with women's health in
the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   A study of that magnitude dealing with women's health _ and the
mere idea of including women as clinical research subjects _ would
have been unheard of as recently as the late 1980s. But the past
decade has brought about a revolution in women's health research,
and the next decade is expected to bear some of the fruits of that
science.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Health Initiative is a 15-year study being conducted
at 40 clinical centers across the United States, and it is expected
to provide a wealth of information. It will evaluate the effect of
a low-fat diet on preventing breast and colon cancer and heart
disease; the effect of hormone-replacement therapy on combating
heart disease and osteoporosis; and the need for calcium and
vitamin D supplements in preventing osteoporosis and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study reflects areas where Beresford has concentrated her
past research _ research, she says, that has the potential to make
a difference in women's health and lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be involved, if I possibly could,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which will also examine women's risk factors for
certain diseases and strategies to adopt healthier lifestyles _ is
a juggernaut in the field. But it's far from the only advance in
women's health research.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America found a 75 percent increase since 1991 in the number of
drugs in development for diseases that disproportionately affect
women, such as osteoporosis, depression, and autoimmune illnesses
like lupus. The study cited 60 drugs alone currently in development
to treat breast cancer, and 38 for ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In another advance, The Society for the Advancement of Women's
Health Research _ an agency that only came into existence a decade
ago _ recently kicked off a campaign titled ``Women Can Do,''
encouraging women to volunteer for clinical medical research
studies. In years past, women would have been excluded from
standard medical research studies because of fears they would
become pregnant, or their hormonal cycles would skew the results.
</P>
<P>
   The more women get involved in such studies, the agency reasons,
the more the scientific world will know about how their bodies
react to diseases and their treatments. And the more doctors will
recognize that the 150-pound male _ once considered the ``average''
patient _ is only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   BIDDING THE 'BIKINI APPROACH' FAREWELL
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a victory over what was dubbed ``the bikini
approach'' in a recent issue of the Harvard Women's Health Watch
newsletter _ the view that the field of women's health covered
nothing more than the reproductive organs and the breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there have been incredible advances in terms of the
pharmaceutical industry,'' says Phyllis Greenberger, executive
director of the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health
Research, one of the agencies credited with getting the research
ball rolling in 1990 by lobbying Congress to establish the National
Institute of Health's Office of Women's Health.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still serious gaps in knowledge to be filled, she
says. Most past research on treatments for common killers such as
heart disease _ the leading cause of death in both women and men _
was based on studies of male subjects, Greenberger says. Now, it's
crucial for researchers to look at how the same treatments for
those same diseases might affect men and women differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one-size-fits-all,'' she says, noting how safety
studies involving air bags in cars were focused on men and led to a
standard later found to potentially endanger children and shorter
women.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual researchers are already breaking the gender
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, Pascal J. de Caprariis, medical director of
virology at Hoffmann-La Roche Laboratories in Nutley, N.J., says he
is investigating whether women and men react differently to
medications fighting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage participation in the studies _ and in many cases,
to make it possible for women with family responsibilities _
Caprariis and his researchers have added amenities like child care
and transportation to the clinic for participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand how difficult it is for women with
children to get into any clinic setting,'' Carprariis says.
</P>
<P>
   Another encouraging sign, women's health advocates say, is a
long-awaited study just getting under way at the National Institute
of Medicine, one of the four national academies created to advise
the federal government on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to the institute staff, the year-long, $650,000 study
will attempt to look at the state of current research into women's
health issues, the areas where more research is needed, and the
barriers that must be overcome for research to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   NOTABLE ADVANCES IN LAST 9 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a recent report by the National Institutes of Health
showed significant progress in women's medicine in the last nine
years, while highlighting the need for far more work.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while there have been ``noteworthy'' advances in
chemotherapy for breast cancer, the report says, more research must
be encouraged into new ``designer estrogens'' that can provide the
benefits of hormone-replacement therapy with fewer side effects.
And while new factors have been discovered that affect the risk of
developing colorectal cancer, many women are still not screened for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberger's agency sees ``the next frontiers'' of women's
health research as including heart disease, metabolism and
digestive diseases, and musculoskeletal health. In a broader
approach, the agency is also encouraging researchers to look at
differences between the genders at all levels, from organ systems
down to the sub-cellular level.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Health Initiative should also help bring changes as
results of its research come to light.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever new information comes from such studies, Greenberger
says they will have a broader benefit than just improving women's
lives. Any new information about the way the human body responds to
diseases and treatments, she says, will benefit all humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about women's issues and it's not just about
women's health. It's about everybody's health,'' she says.

SOCIAL SECURITY'S HIDDEN DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While presidential aspirants George W. Bush and Al
Gore debate their Social Security plans, both men are ignoring what
some consider the biggest inequity of the American retirement
system: It is funded disproportionately by lower- and middle-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the likely Republican nominee, is expected to announce
this week that he endorses the concept of allowing younger workers
to put part of their Social Security payment into private
investment accounts. Gore, certain to be the Democrats' candidate,
calls that a ``risky scheme,'' and instead proposes plowing
hundreds of billions of dollars into the program to keep it solvent
and to expand it, mostly to help widows.
</P>
<P>
   But neither man wants to change the way Americans pay Social
Security taxes, which means the bottom line won't change for many
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security tax, along with a lesser Medicare fee, is
often called a ``hidden tax'' because it never passes through a
worker's hands. But the impact is huge: three-quarters of American
workers pay more in Social Security and Medicare tax than they do
in income tax, according to the labor-financed Citizens for Tax
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, your pay stub probably doesn't show all the Social
Security tax that you pay. Typically, your paycheck shows that you
pay 6.2 percent of your earnings for Social Security, but doesn't
show that your employer is required to pay another 6.2 percent on
your behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, directly or indirectly, you are paying 12.4
percent of your earnings in Social Security taxes. But here's the
rub: You pay that amount only on income up to $76,200. If you earn
more, there is no further Social Security tax. (The 2.9 percent
Medicare tax, also split between employer and employee, has no
income cap.)
</P>
<P>
   The result? Unlike income taxes, which rise with your earnings,
Social Security taxes actually are lower on a percentage basis as
your income rises. A person earning $944,000, who obviously can
afford to pay a higher tax, only pays 1 percent of earnings in
Social Security taxes, not the 12.4 percent paid by those making
less than $76,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   So here is a little-understood fact of American policy that
affects nearly every taxpayer: the people earning $76,200 and
$944,000 pay exactly the same Social Security tax. Indeed, the
person earning $76,200 and multibillionaire Bill Gates pay the same
Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair? That is the question _ but not one being asked in
the current debate in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some analysts say the question is unfair. After all,
while Gates may pay a minuscule portion of his income in Social
Security taxes compared with most Americans, he also receives no
extra benefits. If the Social Security tax cap was lifted, and if
Gates paid the full 12.4 percent tax on his billions, then the
Social Security administration might have to send him monthly
retirement checks of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some members of Congress such as Representative Jerrold
Nadler, a New York Democrat, have decried what they call the
regressive nature of the Social Security tax system. They believe
that wealthier Americans can afford to pay to help shore up the
system, just as they pay more to help provide other social programs
for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler can't understand the resistance. First, he notes that
raising the earnings cap above $76,200 would only affect the
wealthiest 7 percent of Americans. (The other 93 percent already
pay the Social Security tax on all of their wages.) Moreover,
unlike some proposals, the Nadler plan would allow these wealthier
Americans to receive higher Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler says his plan _ which he says helps correct the very
regressive nature of Social Security _ would bring in enough money
to make the system solvent for 75 years and avoid raising the
retirement age, which Bush has not ruled out under his
privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those earning below $76,200 may wonder whether they
have any stake in this debate. In fact, they may have the most at
stake; a populist-oriented variation of Nadler's proposal would
lower everyone's Social Security tax rate, with the difference made
up by extending the tax to all salaried income.
</P>
<P>
   So if it is possible to make Social Security solvent relatively
easily, why are not Congress and the candidates backing it? Simply
put, it is because they are concerned that raising the earnings cap
would be perceived as a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, the earnings cap already is raised every year.
This year, for example, many Americans faced a tax increase that
they never read about. With little fanfare, the Social Security
earnings cap went up from $72,600 last year to $76,200 this year _
a $447 tax increase, according to the libertarian Cato Institute.
The maximum Social Security tax is now at $9,449 per year, far more
than most people pay in state and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are used to investing in 401(k) retirement plans,
the prospect of having even a portion of another $9,449 per year to
invest in the stock market may be enticing, especially considering
that the average return on Social Security is 1.9 percent. That
goes far in explaining why Bush believes many Americans, especially
younger workers, will support his plan to allow some portion of
Social Security payments to be put into a private investment
account. Bush is expected to suggest that two percentage points out
of the 12.4 percent tax be put in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Social Security system is not a great investment
when compared to the stock market, bonds, or even to certificates
of deposit. But supporters of the current system note that it is
supposed to give workers back about the same amount as they pay in,
although there is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   For lower-income Americans, who receive considerably more in
benefits than they contribute, the return is 4 percent. But
lower-income Americans also tend to die sooner, so this average can
be meaningless because they may get far fewer lifetime benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For upper-income Americans, those earning well above the $76,200
threshold, the return on their Social Security investment is about
zero percent. But they can afford the contributions and don't
depend on the benefits like lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The program's inequities are mostly felt among the solid middle
class, those earning around the $76,200 maximum and paying the full
12.4 percent of income in Social Security tax. For them, Social
Security returns less than 1 percent. Not coincidentally, that is
the group targeted in the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, Social Security reform is not much of an issue
for the wealthy either way if you privatize it,'' said Michael
Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who supports a
variation of the Bush privatization plan. ``The debate is really
how to help the middle-income worker down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is concern about the wealthy that keeps politicians from
backing any plan that would address fundamental questions of
fairness in the Social Security system, says Representative Peter
DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who has proposed removing the earnings
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Gore and Bush . . . are playing around the margins in
order to make certain they don't offend anyone who might write a
$1,000 campaign contribution,'' he said. ``I find that pathetic.''

2 IN CONGRESS STALL BILL TO IMPLEMENT TREATY ON ADOPTION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption
professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent
US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve
the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide,
and curtail corruption in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the American adoption community and sources on
Capitol Hill said the two Republicans _ Senator Sam Brownback of
Kansas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey _ are the sole
roadblocks to passage of legislation implementing the treaty,
called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. It has
already been approved by 40 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback last week used a maneuver called a ``hold'' to stall
consideration of the measure. He said his opposition to the
implementing legislation stems largely from the advice of Laura
Cecere, the operator of a Cambridge, Mass. adoption service who
helped him adopt a daughter from China last December.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback maintained in an interview that the bill would raise
adoption costs and impose standards that could drive small firms
like Cecere's out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not respond to requests for an interview. But,
according to people in and out of Washington who have helped to
draft the implementing legislation, he is holding out mainly
because he wants to include language precluding homosexuals and
other Americans with ``promiscuous lifestyles'' from adopting.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of
international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in
adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high. Last year,
16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double
the number of just 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing time for the institution,'' said Madelyn
Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption
Institute in New York. ``I think that's one reason the time is
right for this treaty now and why it's so very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brownback's ``hold'' were lifted, both he and Smith have
indicated a willingness to impede passage of the legislation as
currently written by introducing potentially fractious amendments
and using other parliamentary maneuvers that could tie up the House
and Senate at a time when most members are anxious to complete
their business as quickly as possible so they can go home to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership doesn't want a protracted, potentially divisive
floor fight, so a single, determined congressman can block the
entire bill,'' said Fred Greenman, the legal adviser to the
American Adoption Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over bringing the bill to the floor of Congress _ it
has already been approved by pertinent committees in both houses _
is most striking because the measure enjoys the backing of an
unusually wide array of ideological factions on Capitol Hill and in
the adoption world.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delicate negotiations, the end product won the
support of politicians ranging from Senator Jesse Helms, the
conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee who is its primary sponsor, to Representative William D.
Delahunt, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who has been
instrumental in putting together the broad congressional coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella
organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption
attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing
adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these activists, like the American Adoption Congress and
the National Council for Adoption, vehemently disagree on nearly
every other topic relating to adoption practices but have decided
to put aside their lingering differences about some of the treaty's
details because they view its overall purpose as so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic document that will protect needy kids and
increase the chances for them to be adopted. Not passing it would
be a major embarrassment for the United States and an enormous
human-rights setback for the children,'' said Maureen Hogan,
president of Adopt America Advocates, which finds homes for
special-needs children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993. Since then, 29
nations have ratified the treaty and 11 others have accepted it by
a process called accession. The United States is among 11 original
signatories to the pact that have not ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, only the Senate can approve a treaty, but both
chambers must approve legislation spelling out how it will be
implemented. The fight in Congress is over that legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would require firms operating abroad to radically
alter some of their practices, which currently receive little
regulation or monitoring and which have always been the nearly
exclusive purview of state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for each member nation to create a ``central
authority'' _ meaning a significant federal role _ to deal with
issues that include breaking down procedural and legal barriers
among participants, preventing practitioners from exploiting birth
parents or making improper financial gains, and upgrading the
conditions and protecting the rights of institutionalized children.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming they adhered to the letter of the treaty, participants
would be obliged to toughen some of their laws and regulations.
Perhaps most significantly, the central authorities would have to
certify agencies that want to operate in other Hague treaty
nations, and would be required to set rigorous standards by which
those agencies would be legally bound to abide.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the treaty's implementation would lead to
unprecedented changes for agencies, lawyers, and facilitators who
now function with minimal and often-haphazard rules, particularly
abroad. Adoption-reform organizations say this climate invites
illegalities and dubious practices, ranging from bribery and
coercion of birth parents to obtain their babies, to the
establishment of adoption businesses by people who have little or
no experience but want to cash in on the thousands of American
individuals and couples who each pay tens of thousands of dollars
for overseas adoptions annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once the United States passes this, it will make a
real difference,'' said Delahunt. While he and other proponents
emphasized that they did not expect extensive improvements
overnight, they asserted that the treaty is an essential step
toward cleaning up existing abuses, enhancing adoption's image, and
leading more Americans to adopt as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80
percent of the world's adoptees, US ratification also would serve
as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not
under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their
treatment of children.
</P>
<P>
   People on all sides of the congressional debate stressed they
agreed with the goals Delahunt outlined and said they believed
reforms of the type envisioned in the Hague Convention will go a
long way toward achieving them. Sources familiar with Smith's views
said he feels strongly about promoting ``family values'' at the
same time, however, and Brownback insisted he only wants to ensure
that the implementing legislation doesn't cause harm even as it
attempts to do good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful we can get this through,'' the senator said from
his home in Kansas Friday, ``but I have a fundamental concern that,
without some fixing, this could actually reduce the number of
international adoptions rather than grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said that could happen largely because an American
central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current
international adoption process. The resulting procedures and
regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could
drive some prospective parents out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   He added that small agencies, in particular, would find it
administratively difficult and expensive to adhere to rule-changes,
and therefore could be forced out of business. The implementing
legislation, in response to concerns from Cecere, does give small
firms such as hers an additional two years to comply with any new
mandates, but Brownback said that would not be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he favors making the central authority in this
country a body that would maintain a registry of adoption
practitioners, but would not certify them or establish rules. It's
unclear whether that would comply with the treaty itself.

SHOP OR NOT? NEW MAGS WITH ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to learn that Susan Wyland, the editor of the
new magazine Real Simple, used to edit Martha Stewart Living, and
not just because the two magazines have a similar look. Five years
ago this month, Martha predicted that the next big lifestyle trend
would be ``de-accession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``De-accession'' was Martha's way of saying ``simplify,'' or, as
she explained at the time, ``It's simplify, simplify, simplify.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophetic word sounded strange in Martha's mouth. Martha
Stewart simplify? It's oxymoronic. Martha probably will never
de-access, but if she did, the results might resemble what readers
will find in Real Simple, the magazine that asks the question: Can
simplicity be too complicated?
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple is aimed at ``today's overextended, overcommitted,
overscheduled woman,'' according to a press release. Judging from
the content of the May issue, the target audience is someone who's
not so overextended that she can't find time to read about how to
``streamline'' her life by acquiring a $450 Salvatore Ferragamo
shoulder bag.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a cottage industry in publishing has sprung up
around simplicity. Elaine St. James's book ``Simplify Your Life''
has been enormously popular. Other simplicity gurus have jumped in
and written books aimed at people fed up with overworking and
overconsuming, people who feel a need to pare down their
possessions and their commitments. Of course there's a big gap
between feeling the need to simplify and actually doing it. Some
people just like to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple is aimed at the woman who'd like to simplify her
life, but can't, or won't. She's overcommitted. She feels guilty.
At the end of another weary day of work, she can flip through Real
Simple and imagine how elegantly pared down her life could be if
she didn't have children, a husband, aging parents, pets, grocery
shopping, cooking, bills, cars, doctors' appointments. If she
didn't have to face reality. Maybe she can buy some simplicity,
this $2,500 night stand, that $750 lamp, both ``objects that
soothe,'' according to the text. At those prices, they'd better.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple pays lip service to the concept of simplifying your
life, but it's really all about acquiring more stuff. It's
simplicity for voyeurs, in the same way Martha Stewart Living is,
for many readers, a fantasy of gracious living.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Simplify your life by not buying Real Simple.
Instead, pick up the premiere issue of Lucky, ``A New Magazine
About Shopping'' from Conde Nast. It's the first magazine to
unashamedly celebrate the joys of shopping. It's verges on shopping
pornography, but at least it's not masquerading as something it's
not.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky is aimed at young women lucky enough to be able to afford
to shop their brains out. I was fascinated by a two-page layout of
46 makeup items designed to make you look as if you're not wearing
makeup. But my favorite feature was ``Ask Dr. Shopper.'' Mim
Udovitch fields several questions, including a desperate cry for
help from ``Barefoot and Baffled,'' who bought a $350 pair of
Christian Louboutin sandals and can't bring herself to wear them
anywhere because no place she goes is good enough for them. Dr.
Shopper advises her to confront her label-and-cost prejudices and
accept the sandals as fully realized members of her wardrobe: ``In
some deep, unconscious pocket of your soul, you feel that your
sandals are looking down on you, and sandals, like horses, can
sense fear. Even if they're mules.''

IN TEXAS, DOUBTS ON EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Of the 127 men and women who have been executed
in Texas during his time in office, Governor George W. Bush makes
one categorical claim: none of them were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been
executed in our state was guilty of the crime committed,'' Bush
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's claim is supported by the prosecutors and
law enforcement officials who worked on those cases, the juries
that concluded that the defendants were guilty, and the failure of
journalists and death penalty foes to find an incontestable case
where an innocent person was executed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Boston Globe review of the 127 Texas death penalty
cases found that there was powerful proof of guilt _ uncontradicted
scientific evidence, freely offered confessions, or an admission of
regret just before the execution _ in nine out of 10 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a handful of Texas cases, in which convicts never
wavered from saying they were innocent, doubts remain. Doubts of
varying degree. Doubts that did not convince a jury. Doubts that
leave defense attorneys skeptical of Bush's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is statistically inconceivable that no innocent people have
been executed or will be executed,'' says attorney Stephen Latimer.
``The Texas system is not infallible.''
</P>
<P>
   Latimer represented David Stoker, who was executed in 1997
despite years of insisting that he had been framed for the murder
of a convenience store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   While there was evidence tying Stoker to the pistol used in the
fatal holdup, no physical evidence placed him at the store or
established that he owned the gun at the time the crime took place.
</P>
<P>
   An informant turned the gun in to police and blamed Stoker for
the murder. The informant, described by even Stoker's prosecutor as
a ``lowlife scum drug dealer,'' received reward money and had
charges against him dropped in a criminal case. ``Stoker maintained
his innocence until the day he died,'' said Latimer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's presidential candidacy ensured that the Stoker case, and
a handful of others like it, would become grist for the national
news media. CBS News and several major newspapers have dispatched
reporters to Texas to investigate the governor's record. Bush's
aides, in turn, have polled prosecutors in far-off corners of the
state, to make sure the governor can stand by his claim of
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's office did call me,'' said Hidalgo County
District Attorney Rene Guerra, who prosecuted Danny Castillo,
executed in 1998. ``I did verify that he was guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally
slashing and stabbing a south Texas liquor store clerk during a
1983 robbery. The police found bloodied moneybags at the home of a
relative where Castillo was staying, and a footprint left at the
store matched a footprint discovered at the scene of another armed
robbery for which Castillo was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no physical evidence tying Castillo to the liquor
store crime, and the footprints were from a common brand of
athletic shoe. It was a difficult case for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no really hard-core physical evidence,'' Guerra
said. ``I lost friendships afterwards over this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a silver bullet in this case,'' said
attorney Paul Swacina, who handled Castillo's appeals. ``David's
case was in the gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, deputy director of communications for the governor,
reacting to the handful of ambiguous cases turned up during the
Globe survey, said that ``the governor and his legal staff
carefully review each case involving a convicted killer who is
sentenced to death. In each case, state and federal courts have
already considered evidence and arguments presented by the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the actual facts of these cases are reviewed fairly and
objectively, instead of in a one-sided, sensational manner, it's
clear each killer executed in Texas was guilty of the crime for
which he was convicted,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined an invitation to comment for this article, but
when questioned about his record on the campaign trail, he has
generally repeated what he said in his autobiography. ``I review
every death penalty case thoroughly,'' Bush wrote. ``And early in
my administration, I decided the standards by which I would decide
whether to allow an execution to proceed. In every case, I would
ask: Is there any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence?
And, have the courts have ample opportunity to review all the legal
issues in this case?''
</P>
<P>
   At the time that Texas executed pick ax murderer Karla Faye
Tucker in 1998, Bush wrote, he was challenged at the dinner table
by one of his teenage daughters, who declared her opposition to the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my daughter that sometimes in life you have to make
decisions that are not easy, but they should always be based on
principle,'' Bush wrote. ``In this case, the principle was to
uphold the law of the land. I took an oath to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe decisions about the death penalty are primarily the
responsibility of the judicial branch of government,'' Bush wrote.
``I don't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with
my own.''
</P>
<P>
   In just one case has Bush decided that there were enough
concerns about innocence to intervene: that of serial killer Henry
Lee Lucas, whose confession to a Texas murder was shown to be a
lie. Bush agreed with the recommendation of the Board of Pardons
and Paroles and commuted the sentence to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of events that has pushed Bush's record on
capital punishment into the public eye is likely to keep it there.
The governor will next confront an assertion of innocence in June,
when death row inmate Gary Graham is scheduled to die. Over the
last two decades, Graham's case has attracted the attention of
sympathetic journalists, movie stars such as Danny Glover, and
organized foes of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Though Graham admittedly took part in a violent felonious crime
spree that included 22 crimes in the spring of 1981, including an
armed robbery in which a victim was shot, he denies that he shot
Bobby Lambert in a robbery outside a Houston supermarket. As in the
case of Stoker, there is no physical evidence to tie him to the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was 17 at the time of the murder. He was convicted
largely on the basis of eyewitness Bernadine Skillern's testimony,
though other eyewitnesses could not corroborate the identification.
A gun Graham possessed at the time of his arrest was tested by the
prosecution and was ruled out as the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is the only client I have had in Texas who we thought is
innocent, and I still believe he is,'' said Graham's attorney,
Richard Burr, a veteran capital defense lawyer and death penalty
foe.
</P>
<P>
   Skillern, who saw the shooting take place and chased the
assailant for a time in her car, ``is very adamant that she's
right,'' Burr said. ``I'm convinced she is wrong, and there is no
other evidence at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support for capital punishment has slipped a notch in
polls in recent months with the news that more than 80 inmates has
been freed from death row, including seven from Texas, since the
death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s. In many of these cases,
and in dozens of non-capital convictions, DNA technology has
exposed flaws in the US judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly think innocent people have been executed,'' said
Barry Scheck, a nationally known DNA expert and a leader of the New
York-based ``Innocence Project,'' whose recent book on the issue
helped persuade conservative columnist George F. Will and others to
call for a reexamination of capital punishment.

   TAKE-BOS  
 AUSTIN, Texas: ... capital punishment.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 12 inmates on death row in Illinois were freed, partly
through the efforts of journalism students at Northwestern
University, Governor George Ryan ordered a moratorium on capital
punishment in his state. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from
Vermont, and Representative William Delahunt, a Democrat from
Massachusetts, are among those in Congress who have introduced
legislation that would guarantee inmates a chance to have DNA
testing; both are former prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness testimony, and the use of informants who get
favorable treatment if they testify for the prosecution, are two
forms of trial evidence that have come under particular fire in the
cases where death row inmates have been found innocent. Both forms
of evidence were used to convict Odell Barnes, who was executed in
Texas in March for the murder of Helen Bass.
</P>
<P>
   The physical evidence in the Barnes case _ spots of Bass's blood
found on a pair of overalls that he wore _ were found to contain
citric acid, which is used as a common preservative of blood. The
presence of a preservative showed that the blood was accidentally
or deliberately spilled on the overalls, Barnes's lawyers argued,
and not splattered during the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Jailhouse informants played a crucial role in the case against
David Spence, who was convicted in 1984 of the contract murders of
three teenagers at a lake near Waco. Two men confessed to being
Spence's accomplices, thus saving their own lives and putting
Spence on death row. The prosecutors and investigators in the case
were hailed by the media and public for their work.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against Spence deteriorated in the years after his
convictions, as appeals lawyer Raoul Schonemann unearthed
disparities in the story told by the alleged accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by police, the two men had repeatedly revised their
account of the crime to fit the prosecutor's theory. They were
unable to name or accurately describe the car in which the bodies
of the three teenagers were transported. Though all three victims
had been repeatedly stabbed, there were no traces of blood in the
suspect car.
</P>
<P>
   The police work at the crime scene was dismal and the only
physical evidence recovered was hair that did not belong to the
victims or Spence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their testimony was terribly inconsistent with each other,
with major discrepancies, and rampant and rife with inconsistencies
with prior statements and testimony they gave police,'' said
Schonemann.
</P>
<P>
   The two accomplices eventually recanted their confessions, as
did other jailhouse informants who had testified against Spence.
And Muneer Deeb, the man prosecutors said had ordered the contract
murders, won a new trial and was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Spence was considered to be a violent and vicious man, and the
case for his innocence is by no means clear. But neither at the
end, was the case for his guilt, said Schonemann. Spence was
executed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   No one has proven that an innocent person has been executed in
the United States since the modern era of capital punishment began
in 1977. What lingers in some 60 cases nationally, and a handful in
Texas, is an uneasiness about the reliability of the judicial
system and the prospect that a dreadful mistake could be made.

&HT;     MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES MAY SHED LIGHT ON ORIGINS OF WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microscopic gems from outer space, the oldest
substances ever to touch human hands, could change our
understanding of the solar system and the origin of its elements.
</P>
<P>
   So tiny that they are referred to as ``engagement rings for
bacteria,'' these presolar grains are found within larger space
rocks called meteorites and in fluffy debris from the tails of
comets. They might be 6 billion years old _ more than a billion
years older than the sun, Earth, and other planets _ according to
Donald D. Clayton, the scientist who predicted their existence 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their very existence shattered the belief that studying
objects of such antiquity on Earth is impossible,'' yet most of the
astronomers remain almost unaware of the implications of such
objects, said Clayton, a professor at Clemson University in South
Carolina. He is a pioneering figure in ``nucleosynthesis,'' the
study of the origin of the chemical elements.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the micro-gems was vigorously debated in the
1970s. Then it was experimentally confirmed in the late 1980s, when
they were found within meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than a decade later, many scientists seem unaware that
they have access to these relics of an unimaginably distant time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of astronomers has been relatively ignorant of this
happening,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Examined under a microscope, some grains, which are typically
millionths of a meter wide, resemble macadamia nuts that have been
partly excavated by nibbling mites.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton recently sent a letter to the journal Science, remarking
that a story on trends in planetary science research neglected to
stress the historic relevance of presolar grains.
</P>
<P>
   In a response published in the same issue, the article's author,
planetary scientist David J. Stevenson of the California Institute
of Technology, readily acknowledged the objects constitute an
``important, remarkable, and undisputed development.''
</P>
<P>
   Presolar grains provide information ``about the stars that
contributed to the material from which the solar system formed. . .
. It is a testament to our origin,'' Stevenson explained in an
e-mail response to questions asked for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers been so slow to pick up on such a fundamental
discovery, Clayton said, because ``sometimes we don't take note of
other developments that are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   According to present theories, the presolar grains form from
chemical isotopes ejected by exploding stars and red giant stars.
</P>
<P>
   Over billions of years, clouds of gas, molecules and presolar
grains accumulate. Eventually gravity pulls them together. The
result is an object massive enough to undergo nuclear fusion
reactions _ a star, like the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cloud collapses into a rotating disk, in which
matter gathers into asteroid-like rocks called planetesimals. Many
planetesimals gradually accumulate into planets.
</P>
<P>
   Presolar grains are not floating around the solar system by
themselves. They travel aboard bigger chunks of matter, such as
meteorites, asteroids and comets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the millions of years during which the cloud collapsed into
the sun-circling disk, the presolar particles chemically interacted
with, and became locked within, asteroids. During collisions
between asteroids, slivers and chunks fly off.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those slivers eventually fall to Earth as meteorites.
Flying many miles per second through space, some meteorites glow
brilliantly as they heat from friction with Earth's atmosphere. A
few are recovered and sent to scientists. They use careful chemical
techniques to recover tiny presolar grains from the celestial
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiny'' is the operative word: A typical carbon-rich meteorite
contains only a minute amount of presolar grains, about one part in
100,000, Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Their presolar origin was determined by examining variations in
the numbers of isotopes within the grains. (Certain elements come
in slightly different forms, called isotopes, that behave the same
chemically but vary in weight because they carry differing numbers
of electrically neutral particles called neutrons.)
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, presolar grains display wild variations in
their isotopic ratios. This, Clayton said, could have only one
credible cause: They formed in the extremely hot atmosphere of a
star or in the hellish mega-explosion of a supernova or exploding
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the hot gas cools, the gems can solidify before the stellar
isotopes become diluted with the interstellar gas,'' Clayton said.
The isotopic ratio is ``the smoking gun'' of the particles'
deep-space, pre-solar system origins, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Their age cannot be determined because they contain too few
atoms for analysis. But researchers are trying to think of ways to
examine such tiny objects that might eventually yield a precise
age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solar system is 4.6 billion years old. We know that number
pretty well,'' Clayton said. ``All we know for sure is these
particles are older than that.''
</P>

&HT;     TAX EXEMPTION FOR TEACHERS FACES LEGISLATIVE CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE and ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gray Davis' bold plan to
permanently exempt public school teachers from having to pay state
income taxes is getting a chilly reception from Democratic and
Republican lawmakers who must approve the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ripped the income tax exemption as ``special
interest'' politics that both discriminates against teachers in
private schools and leaves other workers, such as low-wage day care
providers, police officers and firefighters, out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Davis' fellow Democrats in the Legislature questioned
whether the proposal would lead to improved education for students.
They also echoed Republican concerns about selective tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   This year the state is expecting an unprecedented $12 billion
more in tax revenues than what was calculated when Davis released
his budget in January. Budget revenues are up 20 percent this year,
one of the largest increases in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature must approve the final draft of the spending
plan by June 15. The Davis proposal would cost California $545
million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to the
governor's office. The state has approximately 283,000 credentialed
public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would provide $500 in annual state tax relief to
each beginning teacher and $1,350 to experienced teachers earning a
salary of $50,000, the governor's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I value all work, whether you're a janitor, middle
manager or a CEO, and I take a back seat to no one in my respect
for people who put themselves in harm's way, such as firefighters,
policemen, paramedics,'' Davis said, when asked why he was singling
out one profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really believe we have to make a simple declarative
statement that above all else, teaching matters,'' he said. ``This
is the single most important profession to us in the year 2000 and
that's the statement I'm making.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Teachers Association (CTA), one of Davis' biggest
supporters during his 1998 campaign for office, embraced the
proposal wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   The state projects a shortage of 300,000 public school teachers
over the next 10 years and the CTA called the income tax exemption
idea an innovative bid to draw talented people to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased. We think it is a creative move. It shows some
respect for the teaching profession. It is a way of dealing with
the teacher shortage,'' said Bob Cherry, the CTA associate
director.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, state officials said they believe it would be the
first such income tax exemption in peacetime for any occupation in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   It also is likely to test Davis' political sway with the
Legislature and perhaps highlight already strained relations with
lawmakers in his own party, some of whom have criticized the
governor for being high-handed and leaving them out of the loop on
important policy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis' call for the income tax exemption on Saturday,
Democratic leaders sounded genuinely caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a governor named Gray, this is bold, thought-provoking
stuff,'' Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat from Los
Angeles, said in a statement released by his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly he wants to attract and retain qualified teachers,''
Hertzberg said. ``But his proposal takes state tax policy into
uncharted waters. If we do this for teachers, how do we treat other
professionals working for the public good?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Kerry Mazzoni, chairwoman of the Assembly Education
Committee, said she saw little that is useful in the income tax
exemption plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some inherent problems with it. I don't
think freeing teachers from state income taxes attracts gifted
people into the profession,'' said Mazzoni, who is from San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally,`` she said, ``the rhetoric around teacher salaries
will not become intellectually honest until we begin talking about
12-month contracts'' under which public teachers would receive
higher pay, but also be expected to work year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoni added that she believes a tax exemption for teachers
would invite demands for similar treatment from police officers,
firefighters and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Baugh, the Assembly Republican leader, accused Davis of
attempting to carve up the state's budget surplus to reward his
political friends in the state public teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal is a terrible precedent. It leaves out dozens of
over-worked, under-paid noble professions such as day care
operators, nursing home attendants, police and firefighters,''
Baugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be special interest politics at its worst. It
does imply that teachers in private schools are less noble than
those in public schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, who is from Huntington Beach, said a GOP plan to give an
across-the-board state income tax exemption to anyone earning less
than $25,000 a year is a fairer way to assist Californians in
important, but often low-paying service vocations.

<P>
   ELLSWORTH, Maine _ They have an undeniable family resemblance,
especially when they're nervous or shy: the same pout, the
downturned, almond-shaped eyes, the thin lips pressed together.
When Tim King saw the picture in the newspaper, he had to look
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was a photo of Julie Barnes, the 19-year-old homeless woman
arrested after the deadly Worcester (Mass.) fire in December. But
it could almost have been his adopted daughter, Jennifer, a sweet
and bashful 16-year-old, born near Worcester, whom he and his wife
had guided through years of special education, with constant
advocacy and protectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the newspaper to his wife, and asked her, ``What was
Jennifer's mother's name?''
</P>
<P>
   The last name was Barnes, Debb King replied. And then, she said,
``He had tears in his eyes. He said, `Julie Barnes. That's
Jennifer's sister.' '
</P>
<P>
   It was December, a few weeks after the fire, and only the
ghastly outlines of the tragedy had trickled up to Maine: a
terrible blaze in a giant warehouse, six firefighters dead, 17
children orphaned. And a homeless couple charged with manslaughter,
two scrubby souls who set the fire by accident, and ran from the
building without telling anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts fit together. Jennifer King, a former foster
child, had a biological sister named Julie, three years older. The
Kings hadn't seen or heard from her in more than a decade. And in
those intervening years _ years when Jennifer was riding a bike,
learning to baby-sit, traveling to Nashville and Disney World _
Julie Barnes had shuffled between parents' houses, dropped out of
high school and drifted to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was in jail, pregnant by a troubled man 22 years her
senior, her face downcast and disturbingly familiar. To see their
own daughter's features, on somebody hopeless and lost, reminded
the Kings of their own quiet fears: that without close supervision
or family support, Jennifer could have wound up lost herself.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are not a textbook family, not wealthy or powerful or
perfect. But they are close-knit, committed to their daughter, and
eager to connect with the near-stranger they saw in the photograph.
They want Jennifer and Julie to get together, but their goals are
more ambitious than that. They want to help Julie get out of jail,
to give her some of the attention and support that one sister
received, but one seems to have missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to do something,'' Tim King said. ``It's almost
like Julie is part of our family, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer King was born Leeann Barnes, a tiny, sick baby that
state social workers removed from her mother at 5 days old.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Debb Bull, 30, was a single mother of two, living
in Auburn, Mass. She had taken in foster children before, at a
friend's suggestion. But she was soon to give it up. She found it
too wrenching to care for a child and then say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when a social worker called about a newborn girl, and
``concerns about the mother,'' Debb quickly agreed to take the
baby. And she felt an instant affection for the too-small child who
spent her first week in the hospital, swimming in tubes, suffering
from seizures and a stomach ailment, pneumonia and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Debb was able to bring Leeann home. And for the next few
years, Evelyn Barnes would come to the house for regular visits,
ordered by the state Department of Social Services. She would bring
her two other children, both toddlers. Julie was the middle child,
a quiet girl with a broad smile, which she would flash if given a
cookie or a toy.
</P>
<P>
   As for Leeann, it was clear from the start that she would
struggle. She was slow to learn and remember things; her speech was
slightly impaired. A social worker once said she was
``non-adoptable.'' But when the state moved, after three years, to
take custody of her, Debb hired a lawyer, adopted Leeann, and
changed her name to Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Debb decided it was best to pull away from Evelyn
Barnes, to consolidate her new, official family: 3-year-old
Jennifer and two older children, now 12 and 13. She kept track of
Barnes and her daughters for awhile, through a social worker, but
eventually lost touch.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Tim King, a local government official, moved in
across the street. He had an easygoing, joking manner and an
instant affection for her children; he potty-trained Jennifer
himself. Twelve years ago, Tim and Debb were married. Though
Jennifer had already been calling him ``Poppy,'' Tim formally
adopted her a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings moved to Rhode Island and later to Ellsworth, Maine, a
small community adjacent to Bar Harbor, with a spacious new high
school and a picturesque historic district. Tim, 47, is the city
manager. Debb, 46, owns a travel agency nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer lives with her parents in a small, yellow Cape-style
house, where her bedroom is filled with dolls and makeup cases. Her
parents will soon help her paint it purple, the same color as the
dress she recently wore to a prom for teenagers with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Though small for her age _ slender and wiry, she looks more like
12 _ she is a teenager now, and treads the fuzzy line between
girlhood and adolescence. She hangs dinosaur posters and trades
Pokemon cards, but she loves the Backstreet Boys, and from time to
time, reports a crush.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with her parents teeters, too, between
affection and a teenager's shy embarrassment. When Debb calls her
``Sweetie bugs,'' Jennifer lowers her head, half-smiling,
half-pouting, and grumbles, ``Mom. Don't call me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence poses a new challenge for the Kings, who have
learned to care for Jennifer through instinct and dogged
involvement. They want her to be part of the world, and fought to
place her in a mainstream program at the high school.
</P>
<P>
   But they know she needs supervision, pointing to a day that,
when they learned of the Worcester fire, made them gasp with
recognition. About two years ago, at her sister Nancy's house,
Jennifer plugged in an electric lamp and settled down to watch
cartoons. Nancy heard the smoke alarm, ran downstairs, and saw that
the lamp was on fire. Jennifer was so focused on the television
that she hadn't noticed the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also fear the dangers other people can inflict on a
naive girl who is looking for more freedom. They recently grounded
her for visiting a friend's house without leaving a note. They
always want to know where she is going.
</P>
<P>
   But while they worry about Jennifer, they also boast of her
successes. ``She's just a great kid,'' Tim says. She reads at the
third-grade level, makes the honor roll each term, and visits the
local elementary school to help teach second-graders to read. She'd
like to work at a day-care center someday.
</P>
<P>
   Debb wants Jennifer to stay in high school as long as she can,
and then to get a job. ``How far is she going to go? Well, we don't
know,'' she said. But she is certain of this: ``I don't think
pushing grocery carts and doing minimum-wage jobs . . . is good
enough for her. I think she can do better.''

<P>
   The future, like the past, seems far more bleak for Julie
Barnes, some 280 miles away. Last fall, she scratched out a
transient existence in shelters and warehouses, free but sometimes
hungry or cold. This winter and spring, she has lived in a
Framingham, Mass. jail, sharing a cell and wearing prison garb, but
receiving at least one benefit she likely did not before: prenatal
care for the child who will be born before summer.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's father is Thomas Levesque, a hollow-cheeked man who
often was Julie's companion on the streets. They fought regularly,
sometimes violently, but they usually clung together. And they
squatted together in the Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co.
building on the night of Dec. 3, before a fight and a knocked-over
candle led to the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, after a manhunt, the pair was arrested. The
city was still in mourning; the six lost men had yet to be
recovered. The memorial, attended by 30,000 firefighters, had not
yet taken place. The warehouse was still smoldering.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Barnes and Levesque were placed in the custody of the same
state that had taken Julie's sister, Leeann, 16 years earlier. Bail
was set at $1 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before, when the Department of Social Services
intervened less completely in Julie Barnes's life, she drifted
between her divorced parents' homes, living at times in New
Hampshire and at times in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   She was a quiet, baby-faced girl who carried small cats in her
backpack, wandered without a coat on cold evenings, and carved out
a secret hideaway in the hedges near her house. Acquaintances said
she was ``slow,'' a fact reflected by her childlike handwriting and
her enrollment in special education classes, before she dropped out
of high school.
</P>
<P>
   And they said she often bragged about relationships with men _
including Levesque, who, like Julie, has been described as slow.
Now, he lives at the state prison in West Boylston, Mass. awaiting
a pretrial conference in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The case is now in the discovery phase, said Julie's
court-appointed lawyer, Louis Aloise. Lawyers are studying reports
about the fire and considering motions. A trial probably would not
begin until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Julie Barnes waits in a maximum-security section of
the Framingham jail. She has had visitors: her mother, her mother's
companion, her mother's friends. But the days in jail have not been
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's sad about being confined,'' Aloise said. ``She's still
having a difficult time comprehending why she has to stay in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Julie's bail was reduced to $75,000, and Levesque's
to $250,000. Neither defendant's family has the money.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Kings. But they hope to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer King has always known she was adopted. Her parents like
to tell her that they picked her out from hundreds of babies,
charmed by her smiling face.
</P>
<P>
   So when they pieced together the facts about Julie Barnes, they
told Jennifer right away. You have another sister, they said, and
she's in trouble. That much, Jennifer understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kind of got blamed,'' she told a visitor recently. ``It's
kind of sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also told Jennifer about their plan for Julie's
future, devised after hours of family discussions and conversations
with lawyers. They want to bring Julie to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   They would take her to court appearances, Debb King says, and
help set her up with a more comfortable, nurturing life in between.
They hope she can live in a shelter or a halfway house, or possibly
with them. They want to persuade her to put her baby up for
adoption _ or, at least, to connect her quickly with a network of
social services.
</P>
<P>
   Debb King started to work on the project in December, sending
letters to senators and governors and state representatives. Only a
few responded. She called attorneys who had experience dealing with
disabled clients. Only a few called back.
</P>
<P>
   She understands the delicacy of the situation, the tremendous
grief that followed the Worcester fire, the human urge to find _
and punish _ the person who's responsible. Helping Julie, she
realizes, might not be a popular goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been so publicized, I don't think they want to
get involved,'' she said. ``I get sympathy, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debb hopes to visit Julie soon, and wants to take her for an
independent psychiatric evaluation before the trial. She feels a
sense of urgency, with the baby due next month.
</P>
<P>
   She has enlisted the help of Sister Lucille MacDonald, a local
nun who runs a homeless shelter and a transitional home for
pregnant women. She is accustomed to people with criminal records,
single mothers, the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   And she thinks Julie Barnes has a better chance for a fresh
start far from Worcester, in a place where few would recognize her
on the street _ except, perhaps, as someone who bears a striking
resemblance to Jennifer King.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Barnes knows about Jennifer, and is interested in meeting
her, Aloise said. As for the Kings' ambitions, Tim is more
hesitant. He wants to see her released on bail, but he knows the
cost is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as realistic as their being able to raise $75,000,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are trying. They have set up a bank fund, and are
hoping for donations. They continue to search for help.
</P>
<P>
   And they try to answer the questions their daughter raises at
the dinner table. Jennifer is curious about, and anxious to meet,
the sister who looks so much like her. She often asks when Julie is
coming to Maine. She wants it to be soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to help her,'' she recently told Debb. ``She's my
sister.''

ON NEW CD, PEARL JAM WANTS TO BE HEARD THROUGH BOTH EARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid a radio climate clogged with angry, testosterone-fueled
acts like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock, the Seattle band Pearl
Jam is suddenly standing out as elder statesmen. Pearl Jam had
spewed a similar anger when it helped launch the grunge movement in
the early '90s, but has since matured into a career act that favors
craftsmanship over blind rage.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam's new single, ``Nothing As It Seems,'' even has a
pensive Pink Floyd-like sound. Written by bassist Jeff Ament, it is
``a dark, heavy tale,'' as he puts it, stemming from a conversation
overheard during a couple's breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a song about judgment and not always
understanding what is going on with another person,'' Ament said in
a telephone interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in Pearl Jam over the last decade are quite apparent
on its new album, ``Binaural,'' which comes out Tuesday. While
there are still some blistering rock tracks, the best songs are the
softer meditations, laced with atmospheres provided by new
co-producer Tchad Blake, who has worked with Suzanne Vega, Neil
Finn, Lisa Germano, and the American Music Club.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever thought that slower songs would outdistance the rockers
on a Pearl Jam album? Certainly not rock radio stations, some of
which have balked at the new single. KROQ, the Los Angeles giant,
did not play ``Nothing As It Seems'' when it was released, but has
since relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the band felt good about the song, because it was
different from what we had done before,'' said Ament. ``And as
artists, you're always trying to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album is a demanding record and will take some extra
listening for many Pearl Jam fans. The results are mixed. Give the
band credit for sonic experimentation, but there's a sense that the
band may actually have spent too much time in the studio. The
recording process, under Blake's tutelage, ``was more methodical
this time and took a year,'' said guitarist Mike McCready, who
admitted that the slowest songs initially came out better. Because
of dissatisfaction with how they sounded, the band asked former
producer Brendan O'Brien to come in and remix them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rock tracks have problems. The opening
``Breakerfall,'' despite a sharp McCready guitar intro taken from
The Who's ``I Can See for Miles,'' never fully lifts off. Nor does
``Evacuation,'' a muddy version of a rote rave-up. A better effort
is ``Grievance,'' a punky, Eddie Vedder-penned tune in which he
sings of how the innocent are crushed in American society. Thus:
``I pledge my grievance to the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedder also contributes the bizarre but likable ``Soon Forget,''
in which he plays a ukulele and sings about a money-hoarding loser
who dies ``clutching benjamins'' in his hand. ``Ed and Chris
Cornell (formerly of Seattle peers Soundgarden) had talked about
how hard it is to write a sad song on ukulele,'' said McCready.
``So Ed took that as a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the key move for Pearl Jam is that Vedder has stepped
back to let his bandmates write more songs in recent years. ``It's
definitely more democratic now,'' said Ament. ``If Ed wanted us to
make an album of just his songs, we'd probably do it. But it makes
it better for the band if he's giving us respect back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best new songs come from rhythm guitarist Stone
Gossard. His standout is ``Thin Air,'' a gentle accoustic-flavored
love song that Vedder sings to perfection. ``There's a light when
my baby's in my arms,'' goes the central verse. It is Pearl Jam at
its least complex _ and as pretty a song as these guys have ever
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parting Ways,'' with a lovely cello line topping a lyric about
another pair of lovers contemplating a breakup, is the album's
final song.
</P>
<P>
   The album title, ``Binaural,'' means to ``listen with both
ears,'' said McCready. It also was the name given to the dummy
placed in the studio by the eccentric Blake, who put microphones in
each of its ears. ``We had it looming over us,'' McCready said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most cerebral album Pearl Jam has made. It runs
against the grain of contemporary rock radio, but despite its
glitches, shows a band still breathing plenty of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a good time and we'll probably do up to eight of
these new songs on the road,'' said McCready, whose group plays the
Tweeter Center Aug. 28 and 29. ``This feels like a rebirth for us.
I know that sounds like Spinal Tap, but I'm really excited. It's
always good to push boundaries.''

IT'S JUDGMENT DAY FOR TELEVISION NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are more than 200 million television viewers in the United
States, and the networks absolutely love, honor, and cherish each
and every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some TV watchers the networks love best of all:
media buyers. It is those presumed savants of the advertising world
who advise their clients to buy commercial time on this sitcom or
that drama, and it is they who will be judge and jury as the annual
``upfront'' presentations begin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial revenue being the lifeblood of television, this week
is crucial for NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, UPN, and the WB as they take
turns unveiling their fall lineups before about 1,000 media buyers,
corporate bigwigs, and reporters. Sure, the upfront means an end to
suspense for fans of shows such as ``Sports Night,'' ``City of
Angels,'' and ``Felicity'' because they'll finally learn whether
the programs have been canceled or renewed. But the upfront
showcase is primarily about dueling for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Clips from dozens of new pilots will be screened, network
executives will test the legal limits of hyperbole in lauding said
pilots, and the big names of prime time will drop by to sprinkle a
little stardust on the proceedings. ``This is their first target
audience, and they want to generate excitement about their new
shows, because Madison Avenue is going to commit literally billions
of dollars to these shows,'' said J. Max Robins, a senior editor at
TV Guide. ``They want to wow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some networks, of course, are under more pressure than others to
deliver a boffo performance. According to numerous advertising
executives, the Fox and WB networks _ which suffered through
lackluster seasons _ have the most to prove. But CBS and NBC also
have holes to fill; the Peacock Network in particular needs to show
it has regained its Midas touch when it comes to comedies.
Front-running ABC, meanwhile, needs to coo only six words in the
ears of skittish advertisers: ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
The network may even add a fourth night of the ratings blockbuster,
more bad news for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it eat everything in its path but it creates a
built-in audience to expose other ABC programs,'' said John Rash,
senior vice president at Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis.
``Everyone in the industry is still trying to figure out why `Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire' is so successful.''
</P>
<P>
   While they continue scratching their heads about that, the TV
picture will get clearer in other respects this week. Based on
Globe interviews and forecasts published in USA Today and Variety,
the fall season shapes up as a parade of familiar faces in new
guises.
</P>
<P>
   The current season has been notably strong when it comes to new
dramas (``The West Wing,'' ``Once and Again,'' ``Judging Amy''),
and notably weak when it comes to new comedies (only Fox's
``Malcolm in the Middle'' is a bona fide hit). But the networks
seem determined to try, try again. NBC is expected to dump
``Veronica's Closet,'' finally answering the prayers of TV critics
everywhere, while also brooming ``Stark Raving Mad'' and ``Jesse.''
That will clear room for new sitcoms, including a detective comedy
starring Michael Richards (Kramer on ``Seinfeld''). Moreover,
according to Variety, NBC may take the bold step of moving
``Frasier'' from Thursday at 9 p.m. _ one of the premier slots in
prime time _ to Tuesday, and replacing it with critically acclaimed
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' which now airs on Tuesday. NBC averted a major
problem Sunday when the cast of ``Friends'' accepted a contract for
two more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC faces a challenge because they've had a bunch of slippage
in more time periods than the other guys,'' said Bill Cella,
executive vice president of broadcasting and programming at
Universal McCann in New York. ``The `Millionaire' juggernaut has
affected their Thursday night.''
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, 5 of the 11 new pilots are also sitcoms, including
``Lost and Found,'' starring Geena Davis as a single woman who
marries a widower with children. According to USA Today, CBS is
likely to weigh in with a sitcom starring Bette Midler and another
with former ``Cybill'' star Christine Baranski, while the WB will
offer ``Hype,'' a comedy about a Las Vegas showgirl, and UPN is
likely to offer two sitcoms, ``Girlfriends,'' about the friendship
of four women, and ``One on One,'' a look at the life of a TV
sports reporter. Fox, meanwhile, is hoping the producing team of
Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner (``That '70s Show,'' ``Roseanne'') can
deliver another hit with ``Don't Ask,'' a comedy starring John
Goodman as a gay father in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for a comedy,'' said TV Guide's Robins.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers are looking for evidence that the networks have
figured out ways to put a new face on the increasingly stale sitcom
format. ``There are a lot of sitcoms out there that look and sound
alike,'' said Steve Grubbs, executive vice president of broadcast
buying at BBDO Inc., a New York advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for concepts that are a little different,'' added
Grubbs. ``If you look at the successes over the past few years, the
shows that have really broken through to become hits are those that
have utilized a formula that hasn't been on the air for a while or
that have created a whole new genre: `The X-Files,' `The Simpsons,'
`Millionaire.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Grubbs predicted that the quest for little-used genres
might make this the year when the variety show has a comeback. The
``reality'' genre also might gain more steam, despite the debacle
of Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?,'' if CBS is
successful this summer with ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Network-owned shows are expected to have the upper hand in
getting on the schedule because of the profits they bring in
syndication, meaning that independent producers and studios will
fight uphill battles. ``It seems that 30 to 40 percent of the shows
they are looking at are owned by the networks,'' said Michael A.
Guariglia, a former CBS sales executive who is now director of
national broadcast buying for Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos.
``Those are the ones that are going to get special attention.''
</P>
<P>
   However, certain superstar producers will be able to buck the
trend. At Fox, for instance, three good bets include ``The
Teachers,'' a drama about a Boston-area high school from David E.
Kelley (``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal''); ``Don't Ask,'' the
Goodman comedy; and ``The Street,'' a show about Wall Street
brokers from Darren Star (``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Sex and the
City''). At NBC, ``Law &AMP; Order'' producer Dick Wolf will supervise
a new drama about an investigative reporter, titled ``Deadline''
and starring Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   This week will either answer or dash the prayers of fervent fans
of certain shows. Devotees of NBC's canceled ``Freaks and Geeks,''
for instance, have been waging a long-shot crusade to get another
network to pick up the show. Fans of ``Homicide'' may see a return
of series star Andre Braugher in an ABC drama called ``Gideon's
Crossing.'' The legions who can't get enough of ``The Fugitive''
may see a remake surface on CBS with Tim Daly of ``Wings.''

HALF A HEART 
By Rosellen Brown. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 403 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who grew up knowing the place will tell you that Houston
is nothing more than an old cotton and oil town that got too proud
of itself. These days, it's a high-tack paradise of designer malls
and cloverleafs, its atmospheric conditions dictated by sweltering
heat and the smell of money. The city has always been rife with
irony: Yellow fever nearly took it down until the populace figured
out how to kill mosquitoes, around the same time they discovered
oil. Heading west during Reconstruction, a large black population
settled in the center of Houston, near what would become the
railroads and the Ship Channel; the white middle classes, poised
for the promise of segregation by flight, responded by building
ever outward. So the racial tensions of the city _ and they were
legion _ were eased far more by sprawl than by accommodation. And
the only thing black about all that lily-white money was the sludge
from the petroleum industry that made it.
</P>
<P>
   It's an excellent setting for a story of racial indignities and
iniquities, in other words, and Rosellen Brown, who lived and
taught in Houston for years, has made the place a cat's cradle of
nuance and complexity for the mother-daughter domestic drama of
``Half a Heart.'' This is her first novel since ``Before and
After'' (1992), in which she carefully rendered the interior spaces
of a family soldered together, for better or worse, by violence and
loss. With its probing story of a white Jewish mother and the
half-black daughter who was lost to her during infancy, ``Half a
Heart'' has glimmerings of that psychic capability. But the novel,
which opens in 1986, is more far-flung and garrulous than it is
deep.
</P>
<P>
   In following the arc of Miriam Vener's life over a couple of
decades, it volleys back and forth through the civil rights
movement in Mississippi and the Houston milieu of comfortable,
all-white privilege where she now lives, with day trips to New
Hampshire and New York. The connecting link is Veronica Reece, an
18-year-old now living with her black father, Eljay Reece, in
Brooklyn _ a savvy, walnut-skinned girl who just graduated
salutatorian from a private school and is on her way to Stanford.
Then one day a letter arrives with a Houston postmark, which is the
first of Miriam's heart-rending efforts to correct the great wrong
(and void) of both women's lives.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Half a Heart'' is hardly a romanticized
portrait of a sweet reunion between tragic mother and lost
duckling. The first meeting between Miriam and Ronnee, as she's now
called, is more summit conference than celebration, with each wary
of the other and of her own feelings of ambivalence. Married to a
successful, kind-hearted ophthalmologist, Miriam has long since
given up her academic career, and seems to have spent the last
several years poised between effete liberal and alienated Houston
matron. She and her husband, Barry, have two sons and a daughter,
all preteens, whom she's just packed off to summer camp. (This
detail, like too much of the novel, feels mechanically convenient:
temporarily empty nest, Houston summer, ensuing void _ all conspire
to get that letter in the mail within the novel's opening pages.)
Ronnee, who grew up with only shades of the truth about her absent
white mother, is languishing in Brooklyn with Eljay, a charismatic
activist who whisked her away from Miriam when she was 8 months
old. The girl is also trying to figure out how to pay her tuition
at Stanford _ ``White Folks' Heaven,'' according to Eljay _ and
this olive branch from her rich Texas mama couldn't have come at a
better time. ``If she acted it well enough,'' she thinks with
determination about her reunion with Miriam, ``it would buy her a
future, since it was too late for a past.''
</P>
<P>
   So we're set for all kinds of regret, disappointment, grim
resentment, and dual agendas by the time Miriam shows up at
Ronnee's door. Suffering through their first few days together at
the Veners' summerhouse in New Hampshire, the two are called back
to Houston when Miriam's mother, in the early stages of
Alzheimer's, takes a turn for the worse. Thus thrust into an
oppressive (and all-white) world of entitlement, secrecy, and
mannered nouveau riche, Ronnee does what any self-respecting angry
teenager would do: She finds a boyfriend who will shock everybody,
and she herself gets into trouble. And Miriam does what any
guilt-ridden mother would do, which is to alternate between hating
her present life and mourning her old one, between adoring her
long-lost daughter and wanting to strangle her. Barry, who could
have easily wound up a lost soul among all this yeasty working
through, emerges as a decent guy _ someone who soldiers on within a
milieu of hypocrisy and satin-voiced racism.
</P>
<P>
   Scene by scene, ``Half a Heart'' is an uneven book. It possesses
moments of agonizing authenticity, as when Miriam returns to the
first horrid months after she lost Veronica. Her civil rights days,
when she traveled to Mississippi with so many other young white
idealists, are mostly delivered with a convincing mix of grace and
irony; Brown isn't afraid to confront the rocky terrain where good
intentions meet interracial estrangement. But often this novel
relies on mere sentimentality when it might have aspired toward
greater literary and psychological sophistication. The novel it
most calls to mind is Jacquelyn Mitchard's ``The Deep End of the
Ocean'': a riveting family drama, but limited by its own free fall
into one character's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problem is structural: You can feel Brown hurrying
her characters from one locale or emotional stage to the next, and
it feels as though the train took off an hour ahead of schedule.
And some of it is credibility: By using a lengthy soliloquy from
Miriam to relay the story of Ronnee's birth, she introduces certain
facts that no mother ever would or should tell a child (Oh, honey,
I thought about having an abortion! Aren't we glad I didn't?), then
leaves us to believe that such a revelation would have no
consequence. And while Miriam herself was surely meant to be
someone whose central torment has fostered her confusion and
complexity _ a woman up against her own fears and human failures _
she's often delivered with a narrative dissonance that makes her
seem irritatingly contradictory. When Miriam is fighting the good
fight in Mississippi in the 1960s, she comes across as a familiar,
even sympathetic character; when she starts making revolutionary
waves in Houston in the '80s, you simply want to spritz her off
with ice water and tell her to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   These are mostly amateurish errors that are beneath Brown, who
is admired for her resonant characters. But the weaknesses of the
novel don't much affect its high-octane momentum, which will appeal
to buckets of readers in search of a respectable domestic soap: one
with plenty of mother-daughter anguish and mint julep bigotry.
Brown has done her novel a great service by making its most
persuasive character a sullen young woman with her heart in two
worlds _ walking the wilds of Houston's upper-crust suburbs, and
knowing she's on the wrong side of town.

AND YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a revolution passes far enough into history that the
revolutionaries start dying of old age and long histories begin to
appear, it's time for a look back at the epoch.
</P>
<P>
   Which means the moment has arrived to consider the sexual
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Alex Comfort, the British physician whose book ``The
Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking'' became an early '70s
emblem of the avant-garde, passed away in March at age 80, almost
as David Allyn's ``Make Love, Not War: The Sexual Revolution, An
Unfettered History'' came into print.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn's book chronicles the erotic liberation that supposedly
started with the publication of Helen Gurley Brown's ``Sex and the
Single Girl'' in 1962, gathered momentum with the women's
liberation and gay and lesbian movements, reached its apex (or
nadir) with wide-release pornographic films, open marriages, and
spouse-swapping in the 1970s, then receded before the onset of
herpes and AIDS in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That trajectory has become part of the sacred and irreverent
history of the baby boom. But if, as Oscar Wilde quipped, the one
duty we owe history is to rewrite it, what can be said of the era
of Eros?
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, a few things you may not have known about sex, but
which, after the revolution, you would hardly have been afraid to

<P>
   One occupational hazard of being a baby boomer is a tendency to
confuse their generation's history with that of the world. Yet a
scrupulous review of the historical record suggests that boomers
were neither the first to have sex nor even the first to rebel
against a conservative social ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this account: ``Many people, especially the young,
wanted to experiment with sensual pleasures _ drugs, `free love,'
new kinds of poetry and decorative designs.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Well, if you're a boomer, it should . . . to
your great-great-great-grandparents. It's a description of the
sexual revolution that swept Europe and North America after the
Crimean War (1853-56) had rattled the moral code of the time.
</P>
<P>
   War has long occasioned a rethinking of societal mores, and if
the culture of questioning coincident with the Vietnam War
catalyzed the most recent sexual revolution, the Crimean War and
World War I seem to have had similar effects in their eras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been at least three sexual revolutions in the last
150 years,'' notes Dennis P. Sugrue, a clinical psychologist and
president-elect of the American Association of Sex Educators,
Counselors, and Therapists. ``Then . . . in the next generation
there is a kind of pulling back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bedtime stories &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While college students may have tumbled into bed in the '60s and
'70s with the abandon that comes of altered consciousness, as a
whole young Americans weren't nearly as promiscuous as the term
``sexual revolution'' suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Not, at least, according to what is widely recognized as the
best information, ``The Social Organization of Sexuality,'' a
data-packed tome based on in-depth 1992 surveys of 3,432 adults by
a team of University of Chicago social scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Two demographic groups in that study can be said to have come of
age during the daze of the sexual revolution. Among men born
between 1943 and 1952, 53.4 percent said by age 30 they had had
four or fewer sex partners. For men born between 1953 and 1962, 51
percent said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   For women born between 1943-1952, 82.2 percent claimed four or
fewer partners by age 30. Among those born from 1953 to 1962, 77.5
said they had had four or fewer partners by the same age. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A (not so brave) new world &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although conservatives regularly paint American culture as
hopelessly dissolute, by the standards of our European
contemporaries, we are actually pillars of sexual rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 paper, a team of sociologists compared attitudes in 24
European and Asian countries on four issues: premarital sex,
teenage sex, extramarital sex, and homosexual sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are among the most sexually conservative in the
Western world,'' reports Eric Widmer, an assistant professor of
sociology at the University of Geneva and coauthor of the scholarly
paper about sexual attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with 80 percent of Americans surveyed saying
extramarital sex was always wrong, we were among the least tolerant
of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one percent of Americans said premarital sex was always or
almost always wrong, making us prudes by European standards. For
example, only 6 percent of Swedes frowned on premarital sex, and
only 25 percent of Russians said nyet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The kids are all right &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and
Talk magazine have all done stories about the supposed nonchalance
with which young teens engage in oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   And yet others insist that paints an inaccurate portrait of
today's teenagers. One who holds that view is William Strauss,
coauthor of ``Generations,'' the social history documenting the
conflicting values, attitudes, and aspirations of each generation.
Strauss, who with coauthor Neil Howe has studied (and surveyed)
members of the generation born after 1982 for their book
``Millennials Rising,'' due out in September, sees a set of
distinctly different sexual attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They speak more openly about sex than boomers did when they
were teenagers, but their attitudes are more conservative than you
would have heard from teenagers in the 1960s,'' says Strauss. In
part, he says, that's a reaction against the generations above
them, in part a testament to the new peer-group power held by high
school girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now more acceptable to be sexually abstinent or to go
slow,'' says Strauss. ``If in the 1960s there was more going on
than adults knew, in the year 2000 there is in all likelihood less
going on than adults think.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he stresses evidence is lacking, Dr. John Bancroft,
director of the Kinsey Institute, agrees that young people seem
more sexually circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression one gets . . . is that we have been moving from
a more liberated to a more cautious era at the end of the 20th
century,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about enduring changes that find their root in
the so-called Sexual Revolution, the clearest differences are two:
society became more tolerant of premarital sex and women began to
catch up with men in sexual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premarital sex is now widely accepted, which means that both
men and women move into relationships with more knowledge, more
experience, and more expectations,'' says Shirley Zussman, a
Manhattan-based sex and marital therapist.
</P>
<P>
   And though gender differences still exist, the University of
Chicago study reveals a greater parity of experience for those who
came of age since the mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: 54.4 percent of women born between 1933-42 were
virgins when they married, and 21.9 percent of men. Among women
born after 1953, some 20 percent were virgins, only about 4 percent
higher than men's also lowered figure.
</P>
<P>
   Another sense of the change comes from these figures: 67 percent
of women born from 1933-42 reported having had only one sexual
partner by the time they turned 30, with 25.5 percent saying two to
four partners, and 2.6 percent saying they had had sex with five or
more people.
</P>
<P>
   However, for women born from 1952-62, only 35.6 percent claimed
just one partner, while 40 percent said two to four partners, and
22.4 percent said they had had sex with five or more people.
</P>
<P>
   And though unmarried women ages 18 to 29 had fewer partners in a
given year than unmarried men of the same age, as a population
segment, they were slightly less likely to have had no sexual
partners at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double standard lessened during this time,'' says
Bancroft, of the Kinsey Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But if women have claimed the right to stigma-free sexual
experience, most of that sex takes place within a defined
relationship of some sort, says Shirley Glass, a Maryland clinical
psychologist and relationship expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though women are having sex earlier and more frequently,
they still tend to link sex with an emotional attachment, and that
is across the board, premarital and extramarital,'' Glass says.
``That has been one of the most consistent gender differences.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the country has essentially accepted sexual liberation
for the unmarried, we have not experienced the sort of widespread
loosening of marital ties that once might have been expected with
the advent of open marriages, group marriages, and swinging couples
that made headlines in the late 1960s and '70s. Indeed, Edward O.
Laumann, the University of Chicago sociologist and lead author of
``The Social Organization of Sexuality,'' says that only about 4
percent of Americans have sex with someone other than their spouse
in any given year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
You can talk talk talk about it &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One last legacy is a cultural candor that hasn't gone away,
despite the conservative backlash against erotic excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick up any women's magazine and there are three or four
articles about how to make better love, how to please your partner,
how to orgasm, and so forth,'' says Sugrue, the association
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not only just any women's magazine, actually. Cosmo Girl, meet
Maxim Guy. The so-called lad mags feature the same kind of how-to
articles, with advice for men on how to please women.
</P>
<P>
   That reflects a widespread acceptance of, and emphasis on,
relational sex for pleasure's sake _ but responsible pleasure.
What's happened, argues David Brooks in his new book, ``Bobos in
Paradise,'' is that mainstream America has appropriated the
bohemian value of sexual pleasure-seeking but imposed on it a
bourgeois emphasis on self-control and respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The erotic section in Barnes &AMP; Noble owes more to the
University of Iowa writing program than to anything subversive,''
says Brooks. ``What was countercultural and daring . . . has been
subsumed into respectable mainstream culture.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They gathered, the mothers said, to save their
children from guns.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights advocates said they were there to protect their
constitional right to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the hyperbole surrounding the weekend's ``Million
Mom March,'' the duelling sets of statistics and the saturated
media coverage of multiple shooting scenes, some basic truths have
been obscured, according to academic, government and police
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The gun violence crisis is easing, not worsening. Not all of the
gun-control measures touted on Capitol Hill have been shown to
work. Most disturbing, some sociologists say, is that the problem
may be much deeper: a culture of violence in the United States,
which continues to outpace many industrialized nations in the rate
of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying theme of the Million Mom March is `too many
guns,' '' said David Kopel, a New York University adjunct professor
who has written on gun control. ``That's too simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   While the idea seems to make intuitive sense, Kopel said merely
reducing the overall number of guns in the United States, now at an
estimated 250 million, would not reduce crime. And many of the
proposals floating around Capitol Hill would not effectively target
the problem: the people who use guns illegally, Kopel and others
say.
</P>
<P>
   The gun buyback program, a prominent part of the Clinton
administration's gun-control campaign, was cited as an example of
``what doesn't work'' in a 1998 report commissioned by the
administration's own Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing and registering gun buyers also draw skeptics, who
argue that the rule wouldn't affect criminals, who presumably
wouldn't bother getting legal permission to own a gun. The
International Association of Chiefs of Police, which favors certain
controls, has taken no position on licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Banning certain kinds of guns has a limited impact, if any,
research shows, since criminals would simply use other guns. The
1994 ban on so-called assault weapons had an ``unclear'' effect on
gun violence, and did nothing to reduce the average number of
murder victims per shooting incident, according to a report by the
Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs.
</P>
<P>
   The most common guns recommended for outright prohibition _
assault weapons and ``Saturday Night Specials'' _ are in fact used
in a very small percentage of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Child safety locks are an appealing thought, gun-control
skeptics concede. Even Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the
Republican presidential candidate who generally opposes gun
control, on Friday offered to give gun locks to owners.
</P>
<P>
   But such locks probably won't save as many lives as advocates
suggest. According to an estimate by Gary Kleck, a criminology
professor at Florida State University, there are fewer than 100
fatal handgun accidents involving pre-adolescent children each year
in the United States,
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, gun locks require the cooperation of the owner. A law
requiring gun locks probably would not have prevented a 6-year-old
boy in Michigan from shooting his classmate, Kayla Rolland, critics
say, because the boy picked up the weapon in a home being used as a
crack house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that seems to be done for public relations
purposes,'' said Joyce Malcolm, a history professor at Bentley
College and author of an upcoming book on gun control in Britain
and the United States. ``There's a real temptation to impose laws
that aren't going to make any difference. You really kind of
misdirect your energies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights advocates argue that regulations such as mandatory
gun locks and waiting periods would hamper their ability to protect
themselves. But researchers generally agree that these laws would
not prevent a lawful citizen from obtaining a gun.
</P>
<P>
   To gun-control activists, the equation is simple: Fewer guns
mean fewer gun deaths. ``We start reducing the number of guns out
there, and I am telling you, we are going to save untold numbers of
lives,'' said Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode
Island and a leading gun-control advocate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Legally purchased guns can simply be stolen during a break-in,
Kennedy said, giving a proven criminal a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   One idea Kennedy strongly supports is the gun buyback program.
But Gretchen Michael, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
acknowledged that ``there is no empirical evidence'' that gun
buyback programs reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, in which police offer cash for guns, do not target
guns at risk of being used in a crime, said an analysis by Lawrence
W. Sherman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studied the
matter for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clinton administration is requesting an additional
$15 million in next year's budget for gun buy-backs to offer $50 a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the emotional debate over gun control is the
perception that horrific shooting deaths, particularly multiple
murders, are exploding. But government statistics indicate the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides, along with crime in general, are down. Both the
murder rate and the number of killings of youngsters younger than
18 have been declining steadily since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers bandied about by gun-control advocates, the
number of youths younger than 18 murdered by any method in 1998 was
fewer than 2,000, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The 4,000 to 5,000 youth gun deaths cited by activists often
include ``children'' as old as 21, as well as many suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple shootings represent a minuscule part of homicides, and
the proportion of murders involving more than two victims has
remained virtually the same _ less than 1 percent, the Justice
Department numbers report.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that guns play a big role in murders. The US
homicide rate is much higher than in most industrialized nations,
and guns are used in about two-thirds of the murders. So what does
work to reduce gun violence?
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Law, which requires background checks on potential gun
buyers, has stopped 500,000 handgun purchases at licensed dealers,
the Justice Department's Michael said. It's impossible to predict
whether the denied guns would have been used in crimes, or whether
the would-be purchasers acquired guns somewhere else. But those
screened out are presumably a higher-risk group, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Programs aimed at collecting illegal guns and prosecuting gun
violators more harshly and consistently appear to be working, said
Michael and law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Cease-Fire in Boston and Project Exile in Richmond,
Va. _ programs that target illegal guns _ have decreased gun
violence in the two cities, Michael said. Boston has been lauded
for its program, which incorporates clergy, community leaders,
police, academics and city officials in a zero-tolerance campaign
against youth gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond's program carries a five-year mandatory sentence for
certain gun-possession violations.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem, academics say, may be cultural. Rooted in a
frontier mentality, Americans behave more violently than people in
other countries _ even those with far easier access to guns, said
New York University's Kopel.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, for example, is ``armed to the teeth,'' with
virtually every household having at least one gun, even a machine
gun, Kopel noted. But homicides are rare there.
</P>
<P>
   And in Britain, often touted as an example of strong gun-control
success, homicides and other violent crimes are on the rise, said
Malcolm of Bentley College. Manchester, England, is referred to as
``Gunchester.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at a culture of violence, the celebration of
`bang-bang, you're dead''' in media and entertainment, said Mary
Stange, author of the upcoming book ``Gun Women: Firearms and
Feminism in Contemporary America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, there's a socio-cultural factor that's
driving'' the gun violence, said Bob Cottrell, a constitutional law
professor at George Washington University who has written
extensively about firearms in America. ``It's not just the sheer
availability of guns.''

JAMES BOND ENDURES IN `WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The World Is Not Enough'' (DVD) _ Is there any
franchise more durable than James Bond? While the icon can be
shaken (if not stirred), he seems impregnable to social change.
That must be where producer Cubby Broccoli (yes, the vegetable is
named after his family, not the other way around) came up with this
unwieldy title. Pierce Brosnan is back, and he's as suave as they
come. He also reinvents the self-deprecating Sean Connery wit that
saves the character from becoming a sanctimonious fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' _ Bob Hoskins deserved an Oscar nomination
for his role as a well-mannered murderer in Atom Egoyan's most
underrated work. The beauty of the film is in the ambiguity as star
and director deftly avoid being pigeonholed in boxes labeled good
and evil. There's no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock would have loved
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' _ There's just too much reproduction
of the surface of Graham Greene's novel, and none of the depth.
Julianne Moore is fine as Greene's distressed adulteress, but what
does she see in the astronomically overrated Ralph Fiennes? Stilted
and stiff when it should be open and sexy, this one is
suffocatingly respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' _ Oscar nominee Richard Farnsworth seems
an unlikely collaborator for director David Lynch, but it's a
magical match-up. While most believe this G-rated Disney movie is
not a David Lynch-type film, it is. In its own way, it's as
menacing as ``Blue Velvet.''

ENVIRONMENTALISM THAT FACTORS IN THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LAND THAT COULD BE 
Environmental Environmentalism and Democracy in the Twenty-First
Century 
By William A. Shutkin. MIT Press. 340 pp. $27.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Land That Could Be,'' William A. Shutkin argues that a
new era of ``civic environmentalism'' is underway in America,
rooted in a kind of democracy that revives communities and
political participation, reconciles racial and socioeconomic
inequities, and reverses the recent tide of privatization with
renewed public investment.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds ambitious, it is. Shutkin is the latest of
several authors seeking to redefine environmentalism, making it
more egalitarian and less elitist, more hopeful and less gloomy, a
movement that ultimately finds a comfortable place for people in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   For Shutkin, civic environmentalism is already healing the
nation's cultural as well as ecological ills, reflecting the
desires of 19th-century Vermont conservationist George Perkins
Marsh and 20th-century Harlem poet Langston Hughes, who in
different ways called on America to engage ``in the project of
becoming co-workers with nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic environmentalism ``marries these two American visions,
creating a whole equal to the task of rebuilding America's
communities from the ground up, of repairing the damaged social and
environmental fabric that is American society at the beginning of
the twenty-first century,'' Shutkin writes.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as that may be, Shutkin _ who cofounded Boston's
Alternatives for Community &AMP; Environment and teaches at MIT and
Boston College _ is not up to the task of exploring it. There is
much to praise in his book, but it suffers from thin reporting and
breezy analysis, driven by euphemism more than evidence to suggest
that civic environmentalism is more accomplished than it actually
is.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling is Shutkin's ambivalence toward rural America. On
the one hand, he sees civic environmentalism occurring in urban,
suburban, and rural America, offering four case studies reflecting
that. On the other hand, he is often dismissive of rural America,
based on a questionable sense that the country's worst ecological
threats are necessarily in cities, imperiling the poor and minority
people who by and large live there.
</P>
<P>
   He at one point describes rural New England villages as
pristine, when those who have spent time in them would be hard
pressed to characterize them that favorably. At another point, he
seems surprised to discover hard times in rural Colorado.
``Although there are few people of color in Routt County, save for
the migrant ranch hands and ski resort workers who pass in and out
of the area, there is poverty and disaffection.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, this ambivalence suggests an author at odds with
himself, wanting to write a book that is not exclusively urban, but
not sure how the rural landscape fits in. Part of Shutkin's
difficulty lies in environmentalism's historic bias against the
urban landscape, which Shutkin sketchily chronicles, but rightfully
criticizes. That bias dates at least to Thoreau and persists to
this day in a pastoral-chic enclave of elitists who simply will not
get their hands dirty with real ecological problems, urban or
rural. And that enclave is growing.
</P>
<P>
   But at worst, Shutkin's ambivalence reveals a politically
correct, urban-chic bias, fostering an urban environmental elitism
no more constructive or defensible than the rural environmental
elitism he criticizes. Yes, many cities are wastelands and many
urbanites are at risk. But has Shutkin seen what logging has done
to rural Maine, mining to rural Montana, nuclear weapons testing to
rural Nevada? Shutkin fails to discern the enclave from the rest of
rural America, whose struggles are largely being ignored by both
the pastoral-chic and urban-chic celebrants of American
environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Shutkin adequately details the country's ``civic decline'' and
its ecological harm. But his six-point solution (democratic
process, community and regional planning, education, environmental
justice, industrial ecology, and place) reads more like a
candidate's position paper or consultant's mission statement than
an environmentalist's vision.
</P>
<P>
   And his case studies are unconvincing. The Dudley Neighborhood's
urban agriculture experiment in Boston is impressive, but
incipient. Oakland, Calif.'s, Fruitvale Transit Village is
underway, but just one project. Both pose contradictions he skims
over. He rants, for instance, about the waste sites in cities like
Boston and Oakland, yet is nonchalant about the liability and
toxicity issues in cleanups crucial to the cities' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Shutkin's study of Routt County's ``community-based conservation
and conservation-based development'' is his weakest, describing so
many plans, strategies, and visions without much happening on the
ground that, he concedes, residents joked about being ``blinded by
vision.'' And his study of New Jersey's ``smart growth, community
planning, and cooperation'' is much the same, a compilation of
planning activities neither new nor remarkable, or new and
remarkable but not yet effecting change.
</P>
<P>
   Shutkin has admirably tried to articulate a shift in American
environmentalism. He needs to ponder harder about why it is
occurring, where it is evident, and whether it really will make a
difference in how Americans see their relationship with nature.

AMERICA THE CHEESY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PASTORALIA 
By George Saunders. Riverhead. 188 pp. $22.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago George Saunders's first story collection,
``CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,'' established him as a searing
satirist with a peculiar sensibility that allows him to wreak havoc
on a cheesy American landscape that is often uproariously
implausible yet sickeningly familiar. In ``Pastoralia,'' the title
story of his latest collection, Saunders returns with a favored
device that introduces us to another of his imaginary theme parks
set approximately 15 minutes into the vaguely Orwellian future.
</P>
<P>
   This time we're ushered to a futuristic exhibit of prehistory
where a hapless cave man employee, ``Thinking Positive/Saying
Positive,'' is being pressured by the corporate powers that be to
inform on his harried cave woman co-worker. Her offenses include
exhibiting pathetic modern-day human behavioral traits, such as
smoking and using ``freaking English'' instead of cave woman
grunts, to bemoan her sorrowful efforts to support her drug-abusing
son and ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part this is fiercely funny. But when the twist
comes _ slowly, subtly, in a wave of unwanted recognition _ it's a
piercing indictment of the paranoia and boosterism that define the
modern workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders's trademark theme parks are absent from the remaining
stories here. Which isn't necessarily a blessing, since we are
taken instead to that terrifying terrain that has become so
pervasive that many of us pretend it doesn't exist: the strip
malls, food courts, and tacky subdivisions plastered along the
infinite ``Self-Storage Parkway'' at the schlocky fringe of the
American Dream. Of course, we've all been hit with good-sense
warnings about suburban sprawl. But Saunders focuses on the
repellent personal stories at the vast existential margins,
conjuring a desert of discount outlets such as FoodSoQuik,
DrugTown, and HardwareNiche _ all the while reminding us there are
real people out there.
</P>
<P>
   People like Neil Yaniky, a diminutive, balding figure trapped in
a motivational seminar at a nondescript Hyatt, whose chief concern
is that everyone there will be able to tell ``he was a big stupid
faker, because he had no career, really, and no business, but only
soldered little triangular things in his basement, for forty-seven
cents a little triangular thing, for CompuParts, although he had
high hopes for something better, which is why he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Yaniky is Saunders's prototypical antihero: a
physically repugnant, self-loathing product of anonymous housing
tracts and fast food restaurants burdened with clinging dependents,
low-wage employment, and radically attenuated hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes and dreams nonetheless. At a minimum, Saunders's
characters inevitably hope for a better job _ something a tad
classier than, say, a gig waiting tables at ``JoySticks,'' where
each member of the all-male wait staff is obliged to offer the
occasional glimpse at a certain anatomical part, hoping the
customers don't send his ``Cute Rating'' plunging from ``Honeypie''
to ``Stinker.'' Yet it is painfully clear that, in their wildest
dreams, what Saunders's characters really yearn for is just the
slightest assurance _ from an unfeeling spouse, an uncaring parent,
or the unforgiving world at large _ that their utterly anonymous
and painfully insignificant lives somehow matter.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, these are people who play by the rules only to
suffer profound disappointment. In ``Sea Oak,'' a horror story set
in a mythical housing tract where ``there's no sea and no oak, just
a hundred subsidized apartments and a rear view of FedEx,'' a
doting aunt with a grotesque surprise for her nieces and
grandnieces suddenly asks, ``Why do some people got everything and
I got nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the dream of being merely seen assumes ridiculous
proportions. In ``The Falls,'' an office gofer who admits having
spent ``the best years of his life swearing at a photocopier'' idly
imagines a better life: ``If only he could escape BlasCorp and do
something significant, such as discover a critical vaccine. But it
was too late, and he had never been good at biology and in fact had
flunked it twice. But some kind of moment in the sun would
certainly not be unwelcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Saunders is under 40, it can safely be said that he is
already a master of the self-flagellating interior monologue. Time
and again, his characters roam the subdivided earth berating
themselves for their looks, their innumerable failures of nerve,
and their inability either to luck into fame or to rack up the sort
of improbable achievements that would garner the most singular
assurance society has to offer: a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only he could be part of some great historical event like
the codgers he saw on PBS who had been slugged in the Haymarket
Riot or known Medgar Evers or lost beatific mothers on the
Titanic,'' the office gofer laments. ``His childhood dreams had
been so bright, he had hoped for so much, it couldn't be true that
he was a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is true _ though maybe not. For there are chinks of
strange light refracted through the darkness of Saunders's satire.
Admittedly, we leave most of his characters resigned to their
subsistence-level doom. Yaniky, for instance, returns to his
miserable home filled with motivational self-knowledge and the
determination to evict his clinging, mildly retarded sister from
the premises _ only to weaken at the sight of ``the poor dorky
thing.'' And in ``Firpo in the World,'' when an overweight
youngster ridiculed by his mother and most of his neighbors is
finally told that he's beautiful and that God loves him, the words
come only at the moment of his death from the motorist who has just
collided with his bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   But Saunders allows other characters moments of undeniable
grace, however twisted. In ``The Barber's Unhappiness,'' an
overweight, middle-aged hairclipper still living with his mother
somehow finds the courage to ask an unattractive woman for a date _
opening a door to unfathomable possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final story, ``The Falls,'' that self-flagellating
office gofer is suddenly presented with a chance to become all that
he has yearned to be. It's an unexpected and truly frightening
prospect, and at the same time a perfect ending for this second,
striking collection.

ASSESSING THE LIVES OF US LATINOS PAST AND PRESENT

Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America 
By Juan Gonzalez 
Viking. 346 pp. $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latter part of the last century, the growth of Latinos in
this country _ particularly in California and Texas _ sparked a
heated backlash against newcomers. In this country of immigrants,
the battle cry became to seal off our borders and take away any
rights from those we deemed not to belong.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time Americans expressed such nativist
feelings; we have suffered many xenophobic waves. But as Juan
Gonzalez explains in ``Harvest of Empire,'' the United States has
only itself to blame for this immigrant influx. America reaps what
it has sowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Latin America had not been raped and pillaged by U.S.
capital since its independence,'' argues Gonzalez, ``millions of
desperate workers would not now be coming here in such numbers to
reclaim a share of that wealth.'' Gonzalez, a journalist and Puerto
Rican community activist, carefully buttresses that argument with
hundreds of interviews and painstaking research. The result is a
sweeping study of the US role in the Americas, its consequences,
and the state of Latinos in this country today.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez carries out this ambitious undertaking expertly,
presenting eye-opening facts and wonderful histories of Latino
families. At times, however, his extensive research interrupts his
prose, making some parts of his account burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   In the first section of the book, cleverly called ``Roots,'' or
``Las Raices,'' Gonzalez juxtaposes the development of colonial
societies on the American continent, showing how the culture of the
English-speaking northern settlers differed radically from that of
their Spanish-speaking counterparts to the south. He broadly
examines the two societies' approaches to race, religion, land, and
politics to explain why the United States evolved into a superpower
while Latin America declined.
</P>
<P>
   It's a history lesson unknown to most Americans. When Spain's
colonies were moving toward independence in the early 1800s,
Gonzalez points out, they ``were far richer in resources,
territory, and population than the infant United States.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened? American imperialism _ both political and
economic.
</P>
<P>
   In an indictment of American actions toward its neighbors,
Gonzalez describes how this nation usurped Florida and a chunk of
Mexican land north of the Rio Grande, pretended to protect Latin
America's nascent nations from future European colonization, and
then proceeded to conquer Latin America itself. The leaders of this
country acquired Cuba and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American
War, expanded into Panama to build the canal, and encouraged the
creation of financially dependent and politically manageable banana
republics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branches,'' or ``Las Ramas,'' the book's second section, is
the most compelling. Gonzalez relates the stories of a handful of
families, including his own, to explain immigration patterns from
various Latin American countries. We learn why these people fled
their homelands for our shores, as well as how they were received
and adjusted to life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we meet the Gonzalezes, who came from US-controlled Puerto
Rico to New York in 1946. We meet the Canales family of South
Texas, which traces its lineage in the area _ then Mexico _ to the
1640s. We get to know Luis Del Rosario, who came from Cuba in 1979,
and learn how the US government has helped Cubans settle here since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez introduces us to the Dominican Lucianos, who fled a
US-tolerated dictatorship and the mayhem that followed its
US-supported toppling; the Whites, West Indians who lived and
worked in the segregated Panama Canal Zone; the Mendez family, who
escaped from a violent, drug-infested Colombia. We also meet
Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Nicaraguans who were forced to
emigrate because of US-backed civil wars in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvest,'' or ``La Cosecha,'' the book's culmination, is a
veritable paella, filled with so many ingredients that it borders
on being too freewheeling. Gonzalez examines Latino political
activism during the last 50 years, reveals little-known cultural
contributions Latinos have made to this country, and debunks
prevailing myths about Latin Americans. No, they don't come here to
soak up welfare benefits, but contribute significantly to US
society in taxes and Social Security payments. Latino immigrants do
not steal jobs from US citizens, but have improved local economies
by taking lower-wage jobs that others don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also dissects the impact of free trade in Latin
America, the battle over language, culture, and assimilation, and
the Puerto Rican experience, recommending that the United States
make its last colony an associated republic.
</P>
<P>
   In the epilogue, Gonzalez enumerates changes in national policy
toward Latinos, including ending the cheap labor market in Mexico,
colonial status in Puerto Rico, US militarism in Latin America, and
the economic blockade in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez overreached, perhaps, in ``Harvest of Empire.'' But as
the number of Hispanics in America is expected to swell to more
than 40 million by 2010, his passionate portrayal of a people whose
encounters with the United States in their lands and ours has been
difficult and heart-wrenching needs to be part of the national
dialogue.

IN HIS OWN LEAGUE, WOODY ALLEN HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the morning after the New York Knicks beat the Miami Heat
in the second game of their playoff series, and just a few hours
before Woody Allen will show his latest film, ``Small Time
Crooks,'' to an audience of Harvard students at the Harvard Square
Theater before it opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in clothes that seem leftover from his days as a
stand-up comic in the Village in the '60s _ brown corduroy pants
and a beige crew-neck sweater over a blue-striped button-down shirt
_ Allen speaks openly and easily about these two predominant
interests of his, basketball and movies. And about their striking
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   There's a moment in his new film when Allen's character and his
incompetent colleagues are tunneling through a cellar wall in the
basement of a cookie store in an attempt to rob a bank a few doors
down. One guy is shoveling the dirt onto another shovel held by a
second guy, who transfers the load into a trash bag. To Allen's
mind, that's not very efficient. When he comments on it, though,
one of his cronies shouts out something about teamwork. And while
the real-life Allen has written, directed, and starred in 31 films
over a movie career that started in 1965, he understands the value
of teamwork as well as any NBA head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years the problem with the Knicks was bad casting,'' he
says. ``It was like having a good, solid movie with a dull cast.
Five years ago they had no interesting players. They might grind
out a win but it wasn't fun to watch. Now they have a star _
Latrell Sprewell. He's a charismatic leader. They're fun to watch .
. . and they win, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more liberal than any coach,'' he says, pursuing the
connection. ``I let the actors change lines, make suggestions,
whatever they want. That's why I cast people like Tracey Ullman and
Jon Lovitz and Elaine May in this picture. I want them to make
suggestions. To feel comfortable with their characters.''
</P>
<P>
   And no NBA head coach has had the kind of longevity and success
that Allen has managed in his competitive team sport. It has helped
that his small but devoted American following is supplemented by
huge popularity in Europe. But a prime reason Allen has succeeded _
in an industry where the Monday-morning box-office reports are now
read the way the NBA standings are, as a definitive record of
winning and losing _ is that he's very good at managing the
movie-biz version of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep my budgets down,'' he says. ``The average movie is made
for $34 million, $35 million, and I made this one for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the actors know that we can't offer them $10 million or
$20 million per picture,'' he continues. ``I send them the script
and if they want the part, they'll do it. It's $50,000 and that's
it. I was very lucky to get Sean Penn for `Sweet and Lowdown.' It's
the movies' equivalent of pro bono work.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
He shall scrimp and save &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about casting himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``My acting talents are very limited,'' says a suddenly serious
Allen. ``I can play low-lifes, which is what I am, and an
intellectual _ because of the way I look _ which I am not. People
have this impression of me as an intellectual but I'm like Ray, the
guy I play in the movie: I'd rather stay home and eat turkey
meatballs and drink beer and watch sports on television. Honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's all the talk about limited budgets but Allen is
suddenly reminded of a time early in his career when he was married
to Louise Lasser, and they played in a regular poker game with
other couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played for very little,'' he recalls. ``Maybe you could
lose $100 or $150 a night. Slowly, that started to climb until one
night I heard Louise say to the wife of a composer friend, `I'll
see your $1,500 and raise you $1,500.' That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   This aversion to high-rolling is an attitude that has helped him
as he enters his fifth decade of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not as vulnerable if the stakes are low,'' he agrees.
``Also, I've been very lucky to have studio people and producers
who protect me. Arthur Krim at United Artists. And Mike Medavoy.
And now (producer) Jean Doumanian. I'm very lucky to have had them
for patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Small Time Crooks,'' an obvious homage to ``The
Honeymooners,'' Allen mixes sight gags and jokes with self-assured
character development.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, I didn't have much confidence,'' he says of
how his approach has changed over the years. ``So in those early
films _ `Take the Money and Run' and `Bananas' _ I was going for
gag, gag, gag. I was afraid to stop. Now, I get the laughs from the
characters.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mooning over `The Honeymooners' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And one character that Allen himself laughs at is Jackie
Gleason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing for (Sid) Caesar on `Your Show of Shows'
with all those great guys _ Larry Gelbart, Neil Simon, Carl Reiner
_ we were doing satirical, smart, cerebral material,'' says Allen,
with just a hint that the gang on the 23d floor looked down on the
broader, more physical comedy that Gleason represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought much of it until I started watching Gleason on
TV in reruns,'' says Allen. ``And they can say what they want about
`I Love Lucy' and `The Dick Van Dyke Show' _ and they were very
good _ but I think `The Honeymooners' is the funniest show in the
history of television. And Gleason is really a genius. When I was
writing this one, I thought of Ray as Ralph and Tracey Ullman as
Alice and Michael Rapaport as Art Carney. When that show is on, we
stop whatever we're doing and just laugh. And it's not the kind of
laugh that requires homework.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Small Time Crooks'' is a tribute to ``The Honeymooners,''
why didn't Allen _ whose black-and-white work is so rich _ shoot it
the old-fashioned way?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love black and white,'' he says, passionately. ``But the
laboratories are so ill-equipped to deal with it. They always have
trouble. . . . The film bubbles up. . . . They just don't take the
kind of care and attention required.''
</P>
<P>
   Another element to Allen's career that has remained steadfast is
that he never directs other people's work. Although, at times, he's
been tempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone sent me this novel `King of the Jews' by Leslie
Epstein, and I read it and it's a real tour de force,'' he says,
referring to the Brookline-based novelist who heads the creative
writing program at Boston University. ``It's a bravura piece and
he's quite a wonderful writer. And it's a wonderful piece of
imaginative writing in the same class as `One Hundred Years of
Solitude.' I've also read some of his other books and I really like
his Goldkorn stories. But I don't do other people's work.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of Allen's most recent film appearances, as the primary
subject in Barbara Kopple's ``Wild Man Blues,'' a movie about
Allen's European tour with a jazz band, there's an uncomfortable
moment. Toward the end of the movie, Allen and his wife, Soon Yi
Previn, are sitting in his parents' apartment while his mother
berates him.
</P>
<P>
   Did his parents see the film? And what did they think of their
performances?
</P>
<P>
   Allen shrugs. ``My father will be 100 this year and my mother is
94,'' he says. ``They loved the picture. It's me they don't like.
She really does wish I'd become a pharmacist.''
</P>
<P>
   But she must be the only one.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Allen to hop over to Harvard. ``It's great how
this little college tour has worked out,'' he says. ``Without
planning it this way, I'll be home to watch the Knicks tomorrow
night.'' And Allen, who built his reputation on his comic skills at
depressive schtick, smiles. He seems happy.

said Kenneth Blackman, the manager of Santa Rosa, a city of 114,000
that is 60 miles north of San Francisco. Blackman said municipal
officials encourage businesses by streamlining the review process
for companies' expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   One high-growth Santa Rosa company singled out by Forbes is G&AMP;G
Specialty Foods. Its best-selling product is Goldy's Cheese Dip,
but the company also makes a variety of hummus, baked brie and
other cheese spreads, according to co-owners Chris Glab and Rick
Goldberg, who moved the company from San Francisco in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine, other winners in Santa Rosa's economy
are Amy's Kitchen Inc., which produces vegetarian convenience
foods; Lasercraft Inc., a picture-frame etching business; and
Flowmaster Inc., which makes gas-efficient mufflers that are
popular with race car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``High housing and wage costs are reducing the area's
attractiveness for non-high-tech firms,'' the Forbes article says
of the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In its survey Forbes focused on broad economic indicators
including wages and employment growth. The rankings were based on a
range of financial data, mostly gathered from the federal
government, and all crunched by regional economy experts at the
Milken Institute in Santa Monica, the magazine said. The statistics
measure jobs and earned income as well as output in several
critical technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A smaller metropolitan area like Santa Rosa has an easier time
showing up on the list with its high growth rate,'' said Tim
Ferguson, assistant managing editor of Forbes and editor of its
Best Places list. ``It has benefited mightily from the migration of
wealth in the Bay Area and from its good-living industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The other top areas listed by Forbes, in order, are: Boulder,
Colo.; Boise City, Idaho; San Diego; Orange County, Calif.; San
Antonio; West Palm Beach, Fla.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Fort
Collins, Colo.; Oakland, Calif.; Seattle; Charlotte, N.C.; and Fort
Worth, Texas.

<P>
   ! 1/2 ``Battlefield Earth'' Hollywood pulp sci-fi. It's heavy,
dated, and lifeless despite the best efforts of John Travolta to
pump some energy into it. He plays a comic monster/heavy, doing
nasty things to everybody, drenched in self-pity at being stuck on
such a ratty little planet as Earth, never dreaming that
freedom-loving, cave-dwelling humans mean to kick him off the
planet. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Big Kahuna'' Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito as
industrial-lubricant salesmen at a convention in Wichita, trying to
conceal their anxiety and despair. Spacey is his usual stylishly
sardonic self, and DeVito is soulful. But the piece's talkiness
betrays its stage origins, and its fortune-cookie philosophizing
increasingly tests the ingenuity of both stars. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Center Stage'' The story is old, but the energies are new
in another variation on kids dying to make it as performers, in
this case with a thinly veiled version of the American Ballet
Theatre. The likable young ensemble cast, which includes ballet
dancers Ethan Stiefel, Amanda Schull, and Sascha Radetsky,
overcomes predictability and the frequent echoes of predecessors.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``Decline of Western Civilization, Part III'' Penelope Spheeris's
documentary on contemporary LA punk-rock fans. Most of them are
street kids who hang together and panhandle for beer money _
touchingly innocent beneath their body piercings, spiked hair, and
everything-sucks attitude. All too aware that they're more discards
than rebels, they're heartbreaking in their seeming acceptance of
their own defeat and their attempt to be family to one another.
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Human Traffic'' A Welsh take on contemporary 20-somethings who
hate their jobs and live for getting together at weekend raves,
where they dance and do drugs. But it plays like ``Trainspotting''
Lite. Lorraine Pilkington is the standout. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Time Code'' Mike Figgis drags Hollywood film into the digital
age. Using state-of-the-art video cameras and shooting in real
time, he then projects four separate stories simultaneously on
quadruple screens. The result has some of the immediacy of breaking
TV news as seemingly disparate people converge on an LA office
building housing a small film-production company in crisis _ as,
indeed, are they. A lot of it is claptrap, but its tabloid moves
keep you involved; so does Figgis's envelope-pushing use of the new
technology. (R)

FROM SHRINK TO SHAKESPEARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It isn't every sitcom star who can bump William
Shakespeare off a marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey Grammer gets top billing and the Bard goes unmentioned in
the preshow publicity and most of the buzz about the ``Macbeth''
starring Grammer that opens its pre-Broadway run at the Colonial
Theatre this week.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that fans who would normally shirk Shakespeare will
turn out to see Frasier Crane play the Bloody Thane, the show's
producers are peddling a persona, not a play. Grammer's familiar
baritone is ubiquitous on local airwaves. In one radio ad, he talks
about how he looks forward getting back to the city ``Cheers'' was
set in. In another, he observes drolly: ``I haven't frightened
myself this much since I rolled my car over four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Highbrows are rolling their eyes, of course, at the Cheers
reference and allusion to Grammer's pre-Betty Ford days _ not to
mention the notion that a TV actor has any business playing
Shakespeare's tortured tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   What few enthusiasts or skeptics seem to anticipate is the
strong possibility that Grammer, a three-time Emmy winner, might be
good. This is not a vainglorious psychiatrist and dilettante
playing the Scottish king, after all, but an actor who's done his
share of Shakespeare _ and reportedly done it well.
</P>
<P>
   When Grammer appeared in the title role in ``Richard II'' at the
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1992, a critic for the LA Times,
who otherwise loathed the production, called his performance
``towering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelsey taught me Shakespeare,'' says Diane Venora, Lady
Macbeth to Grammer's lord, a veteran of the Public Theatre/New York
Shakespeare Festival, taking a break outside a Manhattan rehearsal
studio, while Grammer wraps up a morning of jousting and shouting.
``We were in the same class at Juilliard, and he knew more about
Shakespeare than anyone. He's a classical actor who happens to have
made a successful career in television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrown out of Juilliard at the age of 20. On the most
practical level, it was because I wasn't going to class,'' Grammer
says later over lunch in the Old Town Bar and Restaurant in New
York's Flatiron District. ``I spent the next year auditioning in
New York, trying to get work.''
</P>
<P>
   He was plying a typical New York performer's trade _ painting
offices _ when he ran into Nicky Martin, now the artistic director
of Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. ``And he looked at me as I
was hanging a dropped ceiling and he said `Are you an actor?'
`Would you like to audition for the Old Globe Theatre (in San
Diego)?' And I said `yes.' And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammer worked with the Old Globe for three years, and returned
to New York, where ``I waited tables and was a busboy and got into
a play at the Guthrie'' Theatre in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he auditioned for the role of Macbeth in a production
directed by opera impresario Sarah Caldwell, at New York's Lincoln
Center. He landed the role of understudy, and filled in for the
lead, Philip Anglim, for several weeks. (Martin, who saw Grammer's
performance, said it was ``superb.'')
</P>
<P>
   Grammer insists he was ``too young when I played it _ I was 25.
I didn't quite have the maturity, or the size to embrace what I do
think is one of the more important, powerful roles in the
Shakespearean canon.'' He says that this new ``Macbeth'' is his
chance ``to get it right.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A stage actor offstage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Old Town is a dark-paneled, red-oil-tablecloth,
well-kept-New York-secret sort of place, its walls adorned with
signed photos of actors, writers, and other local notables who've
frequented the restaurant over the years. Grammer sits beneath an
array of pictures and magazine profiles of Frank McCourt.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there's a frisson of excitement, as someone
realizes that Frasier Crane is eating a cheeseburger at a corner
table. When a waitress bustles over to say, ``I finally figured out
why I know you!'' Grammer smiles graciously. ``Isn't that
charming,'' he says, as if no one had ever picked him out in a
lunchroom before.
</P>
<P>
   Stardom notwithstanding, he seems more a mid-career stage actor
immersed in a major role than a TV personality.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's more demanding roles _ an
ambitious young man ``too full o' th' milk of human kindness'' at
the outset of the drama, who devolves into a ``dead butcher'' by
its end. It is an actor's challenge to make the murderous king
sympathetic throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language, even in the beginning of the play, is a little
more innocent in its approach,'' observes Grammer. ``And then he
starts to take on the power to conjure the darker forces around us.
He gets into the business of state. Then he's a lot more brusque
and to the point. In the end, (what he says) flares with some
extraordinary human emotions. The `Tomorrow and tomorrow and
tomorrow' speech is a naked, bare moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Terry Hands and Grammer ``found a common ground of
thinking about the play, where we think it's very spare,'' says the
actor. ``Terry says it should be done as if it were a freight train
_ that there's a momentum than can't be stopped. It is written in
jump cuts. It doesn't have a flow to it. It's scene, scene, scene,
scene, scene,'' he continues, snapping his fingers. ``That is
pretty ideal for the visual habits of today's viewing public. It
loans itself to a contemporary staging of this play.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammer is ``surprised that some people were so surprised that I
was going to do this. Maybe I'm just being naive,'' he says.
``Frankly, if you watch Frasier, the guy is Shakespearean. That
role is huge _ larger than almost anything I've even seen done in
theater. I've never played anybody who goes as far as he goes. I
mean, when he was jumping up and down on a bed, trying to have sex
with himself, I thought, `This is definitely without a net.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very limited imaginations in my profession, and
`Frasier' has certainly pigeonholed me in certain people's minds,''
he continues. ``I take on this role as a possible means to change
that perspective. I also do it because I believe that I am an actor
capable of a great many roles.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Damned spots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most men and women of the theater, Grammer acknowledges the
legend and superstition that have historically been associated with
``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   At the first performance of the play in 1606, a young Hal
Berridge, who played Lady Macbeth, collapsed from a fever and later
died. Legend has it that Shakespeare himself had to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   In New York in 1849, just blocks away from where Grammer is
eating lunch, the infamous Astor Place Riots erupted in 1849 during
a performance of ``Macbeth'' starring British actor William Charles
Macready. Ardent fans of his American Shakespearean rival, Edwin
Forrest, were infuriated that their man was not onstage. More than
20 people were killed and three dozen injured in the rioting.
</P>
<P>
   Famous actors have experienced freak accidents while playing the
Thane (Laurence Olivier). Reputable thespians receive their worst
reviews (John Barrymore and Peter O'Toole.) In and around Boston,
the two most recent major productions of what theater folk refer to
superstitiously as ``the Scottish play'' suffered ``the curse of
`Macbeth.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 version starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson
was beset with difficulties before it got to Boston and once it
went to Broadway, not the least being that it was helmed by three
successive directors. In 1993, the American Repertory Theatre
mounted a scaled-back production of ``Macbeth'' with Christopher
Lloyd, who abruptly left town without saying where he was going,
weeks into rehearsal. The ART combed the country for experienced
Macbeths, and ended up hiring Philip Anglim.
</P>
<P>
   ``What curse?'' says Grammer, laughing. Then he dutifully darts
his eyes around the room, as actors tend to do. ``I'm not going to
be cocky about it. What it is is that the level of focus is so
intense throughout this play that it's very easy for people to make
mistakes. You get a little sluggish, and somebody gets hit on the
head with a sword. Boom!''
</P>
<P>
   Concentration is key. So is an adage spoken by an entertainer he
emulates, the late Jack Benny: ``Always play up to your audience.'
I heard him say that once on Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 17 at the time, and I thought, `That's the way you
should play Shakespeare.' Don't slow it down. Or play down to your
audience. Play up to them so that they sit up and take the ride
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always pegged the success of `Frasier' to the fact we
play up to the audience.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Grammer's acting day, playing the part of an
uptight shrink or Shakespearean character unraveling isn't all that
different. ``Throughout the process of being on television for 17
years, I've still remained the guy who started out as just an
actor. Somewhere along the way, I guess, success or television
identity can obscure that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest things that ever happened to me was when I
was doing Cassio in `Othello' on Broadway with James Earl Jones and
Christopher Plummer. And one afternoon I came downstairs after the
matinee and a little boy was standing out front and said `Mr.
Grammer, I saw you play Macbeth, and I've been reading Shakespeare
ever since, would you give me your autograph?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I ever wanted as an actor _ to open up another mind
to Shakespeare.''

_ could tip the balance on genetically altered crops worldwide.
Should Brazil reject biotechnology's lure, it would be a big
setback for American companies that have already been hurt by
fierce resistance in Europe. But if Brazil's huge agricultural
sector joins the biotechnology fold, it may someday be difficult
for consumers anywhere to find any food free of genetically
modified material. That is because the United States, Brazil and

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS _ RAMALLAH, West Bank _ In the worst
fighting since September 1997, Palestinian police and Israeli
soldiers engaged in an hours-long gun battle in the streets of this
West Bank city. The fighting started after rock-throwing
Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers to mark the Palestinian
anniversary, ``Catastrophe'' _ or the declaration of Israeli
independence in 1948. It also came on a day in which Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was expected to propose turning over more land
to the Palestinian Authority. But Palestinian frustrations have
been running high for months as peace talks have stalled, and
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails began a hunger strike. There
have already been reports of dead and injured. Developing. (Kaplow,

   MEXICO-YOUTHVOTE _ MEXICO CITY _ About 10 million new and young
voters have been added to Mexico's voting population since the 1994
presidential election. They're a significant electoral bloc and
polls are showing they are favoring right-leaning candidate Vicente
Fox heavily. What's this new generation like? Are they less afraid
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and change?

   HILLARY _ Hillary Clinton will make history Tuesday when she is
formally nominated as a senate candidate at the New York Democratic
convention. Not that anyone will notice. From New York City to
Albany, only one word is on people's lips: Rudy. New York Mayor
Giuliani may have more to say in the next couple of hours about his
plans. Yesterday, he said a Newsweek report that he's dropping out
of the U.S. Senate race is ``totally inaccurate.'' The report says
Giuliani's course of treatment for prostate cancer will force him
to give up his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton. (Vejnoska,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

<P>
   SCI-CO2-EMISSIONS (Undated) _ As the economic and political
difficulty of reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes ever more
obvious, a move is under way to manipulate the carbon cycle so that
it will remove more heat-trapping gases from the air. But the
ambitious idea is surrounded by questions of potential risks and
obstacles. Some researchers are looking for ways to remove carbon
from industrial emissions before they are released. But more
promising, many believe, are prospects for increasing the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by what is called the
terrestrial biosphere: the whole complex of living things on land,
mainly plants and various tiny inhabitants of the soil. The
expansion of these carbon reservoirs, or ``sinks'' in vegetation
and soil has been sanctioned under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. By
William K. Stevens. (2050 words)

   SCI-SPACE-STATION (Undated) _ The space station is falling,
slipping gradually from its position. To blame: sun spots. But now,
NASA is preparing to launch on Thursday the space shuttle Atlantis
on an 11-day mission to nudge the space station upward by 20 to 25
miles, a temporary solution until a Russian craft arrives to help
keep it in place. By Kenneth Chang. (1665 words0

<P>
   SCI-HANDEDNESS-GENE (Undated) _ The latest word on what makes
people left- or right-handed comes from a geneticist at the
National Cancer Institute laboratory here who has been working for
years with yeast and mutant mice and has developed a theory that he
believes explains why 9 of 10 people in all cultures are
right-handed, why left-handed parents are more likely to have
left-handed children and why identical twins often have different
handedness. Most people, he says, have a specific dominant gene
that makes them right-handed. But about 20 percent of people lack
the right-handed gene, and these people without the gene have a
50-50 possibility of being right-handed or left-handed. By David E.

criminals (Jack the Ripper, Billy the Kid).

Baptista, chairman and curator of ornithology and mammalogy of the

birds and has written some 127 papers on them. By Claudia Dreifus.

keep bacteria from being killed in radiation and possible
implications of the findings, and the 5,000-year history of El
Nino. By Henry Fountain. (670 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CYBERSEX (Undated) _ For most people, forays into cybersex
are relatively harmless recreational pursuits. But experts in the
field say that the affordability, accessibility and anonymity of
the Internet are fueling a brand new psychological disorder _
cybersex addiction _ that appears to be spreading with astonishing
rapidity and bringing turmoil to the lives of those affected. By
Jane E. Brody. (1850 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: In
treating cybersex addiction, the aim is not to deprive those
afflicted with access to computers or sexual outlets but to prevent
their abuse. Before treatment for any disorder can begin, a proper
diagnosis must be made. Someone has to recognize that a problem
exists and the person afflicted has to acknowledge that he or she
needs help to overcome it. As with other addictions, denial is a
common element in cybersex addiction, and people typically maintain
that denial until the bottom falls out. By Jane E. Brody. (1300
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCHIZOPHRENIA-SMELL (Undated) _ In schizophrenia, the sense
of smell is impaired. People with schizophrenia often display what
psychiatrists describe as a ``blunting'' of emotional response that
makes it difficult for them to relate to others. But they also,
researchers have found, show deficits in their ability to detect,
identify and remember odors. Now a new study, appearing in this
month's American Journal of Psychiatry, suggests that these
abnormalities in the sense of smell have their root in abnormal
brain structure. By Erica Goode. (790 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENETIC-SCREENING (Undated) _ While genetic screening tests
are remarkable diagnostic tools, they are not without potential
harm to those who happen to carry a deleterious trait. As a
physician who routinely orders such tests, I thought I long
understood this dynamic. But I needed my wife, Kate, for a more
definitive lesson. Her pregnancy raised the point, after she tested
positive for a genetic disorder. By Howard Markel, M.D. (1050

</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-ELDERLY (Undated) _ Three large new studies are
challenging the safety and benefits of clotbusting drugs for older
people suffering heart attacks, particularly those 75 and older.
The drugs fail to benefit many such heart attack patients, and
those 75 and older may be at higher risk of death from bleeding,
strokes and a ruptured heart, two of the studies found. By Lawrence
K. Altman. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study has found that a purified form of snake venom can
act as an effective ``clot busting'' drug to lessen the damage of
strokes, potentially joining a growing arsenal of anti-stroke
medications. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The vaccine against Lyme disease, so far only given to adults,
has been found to be safe and effective in children as young as 4,
according to research presented on Sunday. (200 words)

   _ Runners who get dehydrated face obvious dangers, but drinking
too much water during a race can also be deadly, according to a

</P>
<P>
   _ A Pennsylvania law against ``drive-by deliveries'' _ limits
set by insurance companies on how long mothers and infants could
remain in the hospital after birth _ has succeeded in extending the
average length of stay, but at a cost that may outweigh the law's
benefits, according to a study released Sunday. The extra cost was
$20 million to $25 million a year in Philadelphia. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study reaffirms the value of fiber as a treatment for
adult onset diabetes. (200 words)

   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: How do birds
turn in flight? They bank just like planes, but their tails appear
to offer no vertical rudder surface. By C. Claiborne Ray. (300

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Tuesday, May 16.
</P>
<P>
   NY-OPERA-KELLOGG (New York) _ When Paul Kellogg became the
artistic and general director of the New York City Opera in 1996,
the company was carrying a $5 million debt, had lost its sense of
artistic direction and was coping emotionally with the death at 48
from AIDS of its previous director, the conductor Christopher
Keene. Revitalizing the City Opera was going to be a formidable
challenge. A talk with Kellogg and a progress report. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   CANNES-NOTEBOOK (Cannes, France) _ A Critic's Notebook: For the
roughly two weeks or so that the Cannes Film Festival hits town,
the city becomes obsessed with movies and moviemakers who are
equally obsessed with promoting their films, a situation that leads
to a flood of Americans. In fact, probably the last time such a
large number of Americans were butchering English on the beaches of
France was during the invasion of Normandy. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   JAMAICA-FILM (Kingston, Jamaica) _ The success of ``Third World

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CLIMBS A WHOPPING 0.9 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. factories, mines and utilities stepped up their output in
April at the fastest pace in almost two years, as they struggled to
keep up with booming demand for energy and U.S.-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production, a broad measure of the nation's so-called
old-economy factory and utility output, jumped a staggering 0.9
percent in April, the largest gain since August 1998, the Federal
Reserve said Monday. That comes on the heels of an also-stunning
0.7 percent March output figure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proportion of factory capacity being actively
used notched up to 82.1 percent in April vs. 81.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   The data were only slightly stronger than analysts' average
expectations for a 0.8 percent rise in production, and slightly
below expectations for a 81.8 percent capacity utilization rate,
and likely had little influence on the movement of financial
markets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers were yet another indicator that the U.S. economy
continues to run at a hectic pace, fueled by heavy demand from both
consumers and businesses. With manufacturing and utilities being
stretched to their limits, economists and Fed officials worry that
the imbalance of supply and demand will lead to price inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to bring supply and demand back into balance, the
Fed has raised a benchmark short-term interest rate five times in
quarter-percentage-point increments since June. The key federal
funds rate, which acts as a foundation for all other rates from
credit cards to mortgages, now stands at 6 percent. In theory,
higher interest rates slow demand by making it more costly for
consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, but the Fed's efforts
so far have done little to impede the broad-based economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists expect the Fed to increase the magnitude of its
efforts by raising rates by half a percentage point when its
policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets on
Tuesday. Markets will also have to grapple with a report Tuesday on
consumer price inflation, which has shown acceleration in recent
months, and could lead to concerns that the Fed will keep raising
rates steadily at its next few meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The overall growth of industrial production was broad-based.
Manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent in April following a 0.9
percent increase in March. Utilities stepped up their production of
gas and electricity by 2.8 percent after March's 1.8 percent drop,
while mining companies increased production by 0.4 percent in April
following a 1 percent gain in March.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of automobiles rose to a 13.3 million annualized pace
in April vs. 13.0 million in March, while output of consumer goods
rose 0.6 percent after staying steady the prior month.

POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: 2 fact boxes plus caption below) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON _ As the ferry boats draw close to Catalina Island's
southeastern tip, visitors see the postcard cove of Avalon Bay,
dotted with sails; they see the town's clutch of cottage dwellings
on the hills that rim the bay; they take in the considerable sweep
of arid, unsettled land that is the island's interior.
</P>
<P>
   But the eye is inexorably drawn to a structure at the water's
edge on thewest end of the bay: the Casino. It is 140 feet tall. It
is round. It is of a lavish design that has been alternately
characterized as Spanish colonial revival with Mediterranean and
Adriatic influences and a Moorish-Alhambra balcony. You can't miss
it.
</P>
<P>
   And that was exactly the intent at its conception. As a result,
it has come to be Catalina's most defining landmark _ no matter how
out of place it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. bought the
entire island in 1919, he devised a plan to resuscitate the
island's sagging tourism fortunes. Central to this plan would be an
enormous entertainment center, with a 20,000-square-foot ballroom
on one level and an elaborate movie theater_ with a massive pipe
organ for silent films, plus optimal acoustics for the new rage of
``talkies'' _ on another.
</P>
<P>
   No expense would be spared. After all, you couldn't lure people
to this island with the promise of quaint charm. Heck, in the
1920s, they could find that in San Pedro or Long Beach ... or, for
that matter, Los Angeles. No, this palace had to be something
special.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley and an army of designers and builders succeeded. When it
opened 71 years ago this month, visitors marveled at the elaborate
touches: exotic murals, subtle lighting, art deco furnishings,
oceans of hardwood for paneling and floors, extensive use of
gold-leaf and sterling-silver-leaf accents. A balcony nearly
encircled the ballroom. And a cantilever design employed in the
construction meant that there was not a single pillar to intrude on
the ambience of either the ballroom or the theater.
</P>
<P>
   People came in droves, riding steam ships to dance to big bands,
see movies, listen to symphony and choral performances, socialize,
sip refreshments and breathe in the ocean breezes that wafted in
from the channel. They didn't gamble. In the nomenclature of the
time, casino meant entertainment club; there never has been a
gaming table in the place.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Casino is still a powerful tourist lure, but on a
scale that is much less grand. You see them get off the boats, pass
by the shops of Crescent Avenue and continue along the seawall out
to Casino Point. They gaze up at this eminence, peer in through the
beveled-glass windows, and test the doors, invariably to find them
locked.
</P>
<P>
   This is a building with a vibrant past, but a comparatively
dormant present.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get into the building is to attend a movie (the
theater still functions as one _ the only one on the island, in
fact), attend one of the infrequent public events here or take one
of the 50-minute tours conducted by the Santa Catalina Island Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the Casino's heyday _ in the 1930s and again immediately
after World War II _ dances and musical concerts were held almost
nightly during the summer season. No more. This year, the ballroom
is booked for public events on just 11 of the 101 days between
Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A Swing (dance) Camp, to be held June 1-4 and June 8-11, will
represent an unmistakable link with the building's past glory. But
much of the time, the house will be dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different era,'' said Wayne Griffin, president of the
Santa Catalina Island Visitors Bureau and a 22-year island
resident. ``Things didn't cost what they do to put on today. There
weren't the legal and insurance issues there are today.''
</P>
<P>
   The tastes and interests of the traveler have changed, too, with
a greater orientation toward the outdoors. Even the Casino tour,
which is outstanding, can be a tough sell on a bright, sunny day,
especially when tour buses are headed inland in search of buffalo
and semi-submersibles are embarking into nature's fish bowl. And in
the evenings, visitors seem content to prowl the impromptu street
fair that is Crescent Avenue, sipping a cocktail in one of the many
open-air establishments _ where sports events on satellite TV
compete with the views of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia might get lip service, but little more. ``Probably 20
years ago,'' said Griffin, ``they used to try a big-band series (in
the Casino), but there just wasn't the market for it. A lot of
people would call up and say, `I wish you had that.' But when
somebody went to the trouble and expense of putting it on, nobody
came.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,184-seat Avalon Theatre, with its terrific acoustics, also
cries out for live theater, choral performances or even the
occasional revival film _ perhaps ``Treasure Island'' or ``Mutiny
on the Bounty,'' both of which were filmed on Catalina in the early
'30s. But such enterprises would have to be sustainable. The 22
miles of open ocean (not to mention the $38 round-trip boat fare)
discourages theater troupes, while the theater's contract with its
distributor precludes any regular schedule of revival films in the
evenings. (Instead, visitors who want to experience the theater in
its glory are stuck with first-run pieces of junk like ``The
Beach.'')
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 3,500 permanent residents on the island,
meanwhile, can be expected to generate only so much business.
</P>
<P>
   It's still possible to achieve tiny glimpses of a bygone era,
though. The Swing Camp, put on by the Pasadena Ballroom Dance
Association, features instruction and evening dances _ and
organizers have been particularly pleased to see a recent surge of
dancers in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater, local organist Bob Salisbury unleashes the
original Page pipe organ in all its splendor for a 45-minute
performance on Friday, Saturday and holiday evenings. The concert
precedes the first showing of the evening's movie, a tradition that
dates to 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the theater and its organ will be given full rein
for Rudolph Valentino in ``The Sheik'' and ``Son of the Sheik,'' a
silent-film benefit to be staged for the 13th straight year by the
Catalina Island Museum Society. Salisbury, whose day job involves
fielding 911 calls for the Sheriff's substation on Catalina, is
currently working on the score _ employing the organ's vast array
of sound effects _ for the June 24 double feature.
</P>
<P>
   The Casino is also used for occasional music events, including
concerts featuring artists as diverse as Stephen Stills and John
Tesh. Griffin said many organizers are encouraged to schedule
events in the off-season, so as to beef up the island's
traditionally slack period. Accordingly, a surf-music festival is
scheduled for late September, an extended jazz festival for October
and a swing dance and costume ball the weekend preceding Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of the Casino's history can also be gained through a
tour, provided you're willing to activate your imagination. The
50-minute tour is generally conducted three times a day (times vary
by day) and is a bit pricey: $9.75 for adults. But it's a
fascinating excursion back in time.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is magnificent. The theater lobby alone is richly
paneled with 4,500 square feet of black walnut, a hardwood that
today costs about $6 a foot for any board narrower than 9 inches.
The auditorium walls are adorned by John Gabriel Beckman murals and
highlighted by floodlights hidden behind a 7-foot wall. The themes
reflect early California and Catalina, from Gabrielino Indians to
Spanish exploration to island plant and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Our tour group _ only a couple dozen at midday on a Sunday _ had
been listening to the guide speak to us in a normal voice from the
stage for several minutes before we realized he wasn't using a
microphone. Small wonder engineers for New York's Radio City Music
Hall traveled here to study this design and patterned that
auditorium's acoustics after it.
</P>
<P>
   Elevator technology was fairly primitive in the 1920s, so we
reached the mezzanine and ballroom levels by ascending a series of
wide, stockyard-like ramps, rather than stairs. Wrigley, desirous
of being able to move large numbers of people quickly and easily,
borrowed this design element from the ballpark in Chicago that
bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   You're liable to hear a few gasps as you step into the ballroom.
The room's vastness is enhanced by the absence of pillars _ the
result of a complicated cantilever design in which the balcony and
the downward pressure of the roof provide counterweight on a couple
of 178-foot, 50-ton steel girders passing beneath your feet at
right angles. The ceiling is a great umbrella. And a spectacular
view of the ocean, Avalon Bay and Catalina's hills can be taken in
through a 250-degree span of windows and balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about all those stomping feet disturbing any theater
patrons below. Sound and vibration is absorbed through extensive
layering beneath the hardwood floor: felt, acoustical paper, pine
subfloor, cork. They obviously built with durability in mind in the
late 1920s: Our guide told us that Avalon High School's basketball
team played its home games here when its gym was being worked on in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, exhausted dancers could refresh themselves at an
expansive ... soda fountain? Yes, turns out the Wrigleys were
staunch prohibitionists, even after the repeal of the 18th
Amendment in 1933. So revelers had to content themselves with
libations such as the Wrigley Welcome _ crushed cherries, vanilla
ice cream, orange sherbet, marshmallow, whipped cream, chopped
walnuts, cherry; 35 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not to say the place was dry all those years. ``The
drinks were served without it (alcohol),'' said Diane Conover, a
museum staffer and former Casino tour guide, ``but that doesn't
mean they went down that way. Silver flasks were very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-service bar wasn't installed until 1948, coinciding with
a post-war surge in the popularity of the Casino. By the early
1950s, the bill would include such entertainers as Jimmy Dorsey,
Woody Herman, Stan Kenton and Dick Haymes.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the early '60s, big bands were playing to dance
crowds five nights a week during the summer high season, but this
began to fizzle out in the middle of that decade, and the Casino
has maintained only a tenuous link with its golden age since then.
</P>
<P>
   Other events have also been casualties of apathy and changing
tastes: symphony and band concerts, a performance of Handel's
``Messiah'' each Christmas by an island choral group.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, said the visitors bureau's Griffin, ``It was
a major volunteer commitment. The woman who ran it moved off the
island and no one else stepped up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Casino may soon be losing another precious tradition.
Salisbury, who has served as organist since 1958, is preparing to
swap island life for a retreat in the San Bernardino Mountains. He
and wife Mary recently bought a home in Running Springs and plan to
move there next April.
</P>
<P>
   Time to pass the torch to another? ``I would,'' Salisbury said,
a note of despair in his voice, ``but I can't find anyone to pass
it to.'' &QL;

TOYS R US SOARS PAST EARNINGS ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Stock price cited in last graf does not reflect market close)  
 By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toys R Us Inc.(TOY:NYSE), the world's largest toy retailer,
reported a 41 percent rise in first-quarter earnings Monday
sweeping past earnings estimates, as a result of higher sales in
its worldwide toy and juvenile businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Paramus, N.J.-based company said earnings before one-time
items for the quarter rose to $24 million, or 10 cents a diluted
share, from $17 million, or 7 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
projected earnings of 6 cents a share in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion, compared with $2.2
billion in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Including a pretax gain of $315 million from the initial public
offering of its Toys R Us Japan Ltd. unit and a loss of $9 million
related to its ToysRUs.com Internet operations, earnings totaled
$215 million, or 93 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The completion of our previously announced Japanese
subsidiary's IPO allows us to continue to report 48 percent of the
future earnings of this strong, independent company and to continue
to receive royalty income while at the same time eliminating the
debt related to the Japanese business,'' John Eyler, president and
chief executive of Toys R Us, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable toy store sales in the United States rose 2 percent
for the quarter, while international comparable toy store sales
rose 7 percent. The company's Babies R Us unit also posted a 10
percent increase in same-store sales, while its Kids R Us
same-store sales decreased from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Toys R Us said it would close 20 of its 205 Kids R Us
children's clothing stores and 15 underperforming international
stores in 2000 and would open stores geared toward babies and in
better-positioned overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it is in the midst of improving its
ToysRUs.com Web site and said it plans this year to focus on
resolving some highly publicized problems their Web site

<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON _ Most of Catalina Island's tourist lodgings are
clustered near Avalon's town center, which patrons might find to be
both a convenience and a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk from the boat dock to the small hotels that hug
Crescent Avenue, but your room is likely to be right on top of the
perpetual, late-night bash that is Avalon's pedestrian plaza.
</P>
<P>
   An establishment slightly inland can provide different
drawbacks. On a recent visit, I sampled the Hotel St. Lauren, a
big, pink, Victorian wedding cake of a hotel at the corner of
Metropole Avenue and Beacon Street. It was comfortable enough, but
Catalina, in favoring electric golf carts over internal-combustion
vehicles, has swapped one form of pollution for another.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean-view room on the second floor here was like having a
box at the Golf Cart 500. The carts continually scream up and down
the hills, all day and late into the night, their overtaxed motors
sounding like electric shavers during a power surge.
</P>
<P>
   For peace and quiet on Catalina _ without having to pay the
steep rates of the incomparable Inn on Mount Ada _ the best option
might be the Zane Grey Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   It perches on a hill above the island's Casino, at the west edge
of Avalon Bay. And Chimes Tower Road, which snakes past its front
door, gets only infrequent traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo's greatest attributes are its location _ the views
are terrific _ and its distinction as the former home of Grey, a
prolific writer of Western novels in the 1910s, '20s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   At that, this place might not be for everyone. It's rustic, with
simple, basic furnishings. It feels old, it smells old ... it is
old _ built at the author's bidding in 1926. Because it was later
converted from home to hotel, most of the guest rooms had to be
retrofitted with bathrooms, and in many cases it was a tight
squeeze. A 5-foot-11 patron is likely to find, for example, a
shower stall that is exactly 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have neither phones nor TVs. Instead, guests who want
to catch a particular show gather by the fireplace in the living
room _ and hope no one has chosen that particular moment to play
the Pueblo's grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat visitors to the Pueblo roll with these quirks, and
perhaps like the place all the more for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's an old building, there are some things we can't
change,'' said general manager Michael Shehabi. ``But everything is
functional, everything works. Sometimes people hear 'rustic' and
they're not sure what they're going to get. We make sure it's super
clean, but the rusticness stays _ we're not going to modernize it
at all. A lot of the guests tell me they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo has 16 guest rooms, seven of which have full ocean
views. Four of the nine canyon-view rooms have private balconies.
It also has something that's hard to come by in Catalina: a pool.
In deference to Grey's legacy, this one is in the shape of an
arrowhead.
</P>
<P>
   Three different sitting areas at the Pueblo provide excellent
views _ two of the bay, one of the scrub-covered hills to the west.
Those views come with a price, in that it's a steep climb from the
town center to here. It can be invigorating on a cool evening, but
if you're not up to it, complimentary taxi service is provided at
scheduled times during the day. (The taxi ride from the boat dock
to the hotel is also complimentary.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the Pueblo's nice touches is that each of the rooms is
named after one of Grey's novels. He produced more than 60 of them,
cranking them out at the rate of about one per month, and wrote
many of them at his home in Altadena or here. Most of the yarns are
moral tales featuring a loner protagonist with a mysterious past
who fights to uphold virtue and protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you stay in a room named for his most popular works
_ ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' (1912) or ``The Vanishing
American'' (1925) _ but you'll find a complete set of them in a
bookshelf in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can find the book that corresponds to your room. Then,
on a still Catalina night, in a room high above the hum of Avalon,
you can settle in with one of these books, and be transported into
Grey's world by words like these: ``There, beside his horse, stood
Lassiter, his dark apparel and the great black gun-sheaths
contrasting singularly with his gentle smile ...'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates at the Zane Grey Pueblo range from $135 to $165 in high
season (June through September). Until June 1, rates range from $80
to $110 on midweek nights, $135 to $165 on weekends. For
information or reservations, call (800) 378-3256 or (310) 510-0966.
The Pueblo's Web site is difficult to find and fairly unsatisfying
when you finally get there (it doesn't show pictures of individual
rooms, for example, as most lodging Web sites do). Go to
www.virtualcities.com, then click on ``Bed &AMP; Breakfast'' under
First Traveler's Choice. Then click on ``California,'' and scroll
down to ``Islands Off the Coast'' to find the Zane Grey Pueblo
entry. &QL;

LEXMARK MAKES HIGH RES, LOW COST PRINTER
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the old days of computing _ when entire programs fit on
one floppy disk _ printer resolution was measured in terms of pins.
The nine-pin printer had nine pins that jabbed at a ribbon and made
letters on paper. The 24-pin printer was a vast improvement. More
pins meant smoother text and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Pin-type printers have gone the way of green-and-black monitor
screens. They've been replaced by ink-jet printers that have far
higher resolution, are cheaper, print faster and print in full
color (something the pin printers did in their later years, but
with limited success).
</P>
<P>
   The highest resolution in the industry is built by Lexmark,
which uses ink cartridges with 1200-by-1200 dots-per-inch
resolution. The company announced this month that its new consumer
ink-jet, the Z52, will have a resolution of 2400-by-1200 dpi and
carry a street price of around $180.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said the high resolution can be printed on
plain paper (rather than the more expensive photo variety).
However, the best results will probably come from using the special
photo paper, particularly when printing photographs from
high-resolution cameras.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fast. The Z52 can produce a gray-scale page every four
seconds (15 pages a minute). It will print 7 pages a minute in
color.
</P>
<P>
   For Apple users, there is additional good news. The printer has
the normal printer-port connector, but also has Universal Serial
Bus support so it can be connected to newer Macintosh systems.
</P>
<P>
   The printer uses the same paper-handling system that reduces
paper jams, the same design as the popular Z51 printer that is
currently at the top of PC World's Top 10 Printer List.
</P>
<P>
   A Lexmark spokesman said the new printer has the highest
durability cycle of any Lexmark inkjet printers. Although priced
for the home market, the printer also can handle small-business
tasks, like dual-side printing. Since the printer only prints on
one side of the paper at a time, the pages have to be run through
the printer a second time.
</P>
<P>
   The Z52 will be available in major retail stores handling
computers and electronics. It carries a one-year warranty with a
next-business-day exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the company's Web site: www.lexmark.com.

&HT;     CROP YIELDS GROW DESPITE LAND LOST TO URBAN SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTROVILLE, Calif. _ From Mulligan Hill to Moro Cojo Slough
near the Salinas River mouth lie the foggy fields of noble thistle
that have won for Castroville the title ``Artichoke Capital of the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   The fields have shrunk 50 percent over the past two decades but
produce just as many artichokes, exemplifying a phenomenon that
sustains the vigor of California farming despite urban sprawl: more
crop from less land.
</P>
<P>
   California produces all of the artichokes grown in the United
States, and the industry's numbers stand as a fair example of the
efficient use to which farmland is now being put.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey County, where most of the artichokes are grown, the
cash value of the 1998 crop was $38.8 million on 43,115 tons
harvested from 6,451 acres. In 1983, by contrast, the $27.3 million
harvest was 36,720 tons from 9,135 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have nearly 14,000 acres in 'chokes, now we've got
less than half that,'' said Hugo Tottino, co-owner of Ocean Mist
Farms, which, with 3,600 acres, is the nation's preeminent grower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planting different (closer) spacings, we know how to use
fertilizer better, we're using drip (irrigation) to use water
better,'' said Tottino, whose father started the business in 1923.
And ``these young fellas with computers, they've changed a lot of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Mist, like other Salinas Valley growers, is experimenting
with 80-inch-wide beds for romaine, a variety of lettuce, to
increase its yield. The wider beds have five rows instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ground's expensive. You have to make the best use of it
you can,'' said Adrian Zendejas, pest management specialist and
field supervisor for Ocean Mist.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable per-acre increase in artichoke production is
matched in several vegetable crops grown in the Salinas Valley,
including the iceberg lettuce, signature crop of ``The Salad Bowl
of the World.'' Whereas 400 cartons per acre was once an acceptable
yield, the average is now closer to 1,000, according to deputy
agricultural Commissioner Gerry Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of prime farmland has been a chronic concern in
California since the end of World War II as urbanization eats up
orchards, vineyards and vegetable fields in Santa Clara, Orange,
San Bernardino and other counties where agriculture once
predominated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 12 million to 14 million newcomers expected by 2020
bound to increase the pressure for farmland conversion in
California, what is needed to assure a healthy future for
agriculture is a rational land conservation policy emphasizing
urban infill, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides believes that unless California policy makers start
focusing on community design that factors in agriculture and open
space, unplanned growth will inevitably bring on both economic and
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest hook the state has, its leverage, is that in the
next decade it's going to provide $70 (billion) to $100 billion for
capital investment in communities for infrastructure,'' Angelides
said. That money should be used to encourage building up urban
areas to spare farmland and open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to push money out the door for every project
that fosters irrational growth patterns,'' he said. ``It should be
done around strong regional plans supporting more sustainable
patterns of growth, and that (state) money is the most powerful
tool we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture may be in a state of relative diminution as other
(economic) sectors rise in California, but it is the leading
industry feeding people in this nation and in the world. It's huge
and significant for our society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1984 and 1996, California lost 218,243 acres of
irrigated land and 71,000 nonirrigated acres to urban conversion,
according to Greg Poseley, manager of the Department of
Conservation's farmland mapping program.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, because marginal land has been irrigated and
nurtured and brought into production to replace land lost to
streets and buildings, irrigated acreage farmed remains about what
it was in 1950, nine million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some remarkable changes in technology for farmers,''
including pest management, said Daniel Sumner, director of the
Agricultural Issues Center at the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Output per unit of irrigation water has gone up
substantially,'' and the state's farm productivity index _ a
complicated calculation measuring farm output divided by input _
has doubled since 1949, Sumner said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Food and Agriculture's statistics
service, state farmers grew an average of 27,047,781 tons of field
crops, fruits and nuts, vegetables and melons from 1950 to 1954. In
1997, the last year for which statistics are available, comparable
tonnage was 68,457,770.
</P>
<P>
   While lacking the glamour and international cachet of the film
and high-tech industries, California agriculture is equally
unusual, producing 350 crops _ a dozen grown only in the state _
with an on-the-farm value of $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ways in which farmers have compensated for the loss of
prime land on the urban edge, as well as rising production costs
and political problems associated with water use, is by shifting to
higher value crops.
</P>
<P>
   Almonds, pistachios, strawberries, walnuts and flowers are being
grown on land that was once pasture, barley and bean fields. They
have emerged among the state's most valuable crops.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almonds, for example, a comparatively minor crop in 1950, are
now being grown on 460,000 acres in Stanislaus, Kern, Fresno and
other Central Valley counties and have become California's No. 1
export crop, valued at $759.5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Low value sugar beets have disappeared from the Salinas Valley,
where Spreckels Sugar once had a huge plant to process a crop that
was second only to lettuce in acreage. Wine grapes, broccoli and
other row crops replaced the beets.
</P>
<P>
   With improved per-acre crop yields the rule, overproduction
remains a nagging problem in the fresh fruit and vegetable
industry. Consequently, some growers like David Mas Masumoto of Del
Mar, who grows peaches, nectarines and raisin grapes on his 80-acre
farm, have taken a different route to survival in what has
historically been a high-risk, free market business.
</P>
<P>
   Masumoto, whose 1995 book ``Epitaph for a Peach,'' has become a
minor classic among students of rural California life, has become
one of California's 727 certified organic farmers, forswearing
chemical pesticides and fertilizers and relying on Earth's
resources. ``My yields are just as good, but the management is a
lot more intensive. You have to be out in the field a lot, and
there's a lot more expensive hand labor,'' Masumoto said.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, certified organic produce fetches a higher price
in its special niche. ``Organic customers don't buy with their
eyes, they buy with their taste buds in mind,'' Masumoto said. And
they have rescued from the woodpile his Sun Crest peaches which,
while juicy and tasty, lack the cosmetic appeal of some other
varieties that have longer shelf life.

SPACEY, DEVITO REALLY SELL `THE BIG KAHUNA' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for Lebanon Daily News)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BIG KAHUNA 
Directed by: John Swanbeck 
Screenplay by: Roger Reuff (based on his play) 
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Peter Facinelli 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willy Loman never died, not really. In ``The Big Kahuna,'' he's
very much alive in the souls of three industrial lubricant salesmen
sweating to land a big customer at a convention in the heart of the
heartland _ Wichita, Kan. There isn't a lot of mercy out there for
them. The veteran drummers played by Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito
know this. They are not happy that their company's hospitality
suite budget does not extend beyond carrot sticks and a cheeseball,
while their rivals dangle platters of shrimp on ice to the
customers they're all wooing. So they're nervous.
</P>
<P>
   They handle it in different ways. Spacey's Larry expresses his
anxiety by running off at the mouth. Spacey running off at the
mouth has become one of the delights of contemporary moviegoing.
Ranging effortlessly between biting irony and outright insult in
his first film to be released since ``American Beauty,'' one has
only to note the wicked gleam in his eye, the chiseled mockery in
his tone, the slight curl of distaste at the edges of his lips, and
we know we're getting vintage Spacey as Larry lays into the
inadequacy of the hospitality suite and the callowness of the third
man on the team, Peter Facinelli's dewy-cheeked rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey is a stage-trained veteran, and there's more of his
corroded, self-loathing Hickey from Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman
Cometh'' than there is of Willy Loman. Arthur Miller's salesman
necessarily remained self-deludingly optimistic in order to keep
doing his job. Not Larry. He's smart enough to know he's in
trouble. He tries to tame his panic by talking a lot. But the more
he talks, the less he's saying. Larry begins on a note of high
attack, then arcs downward as he struggles to maintain his
composure and the feeling that he's successfully repelling the
threat he perceives in the younger man.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito's Phil becomes the dominant presence. It's one of
DeVito's best performances, partly because in this film that
reveals its stage origins in excessive, static talkiness, Phil has
less to say. When he does speak, there's a weight of authority in
his words that convinces us it has come from a rethinking of the
priorities he has lived by all his adult life. The expression
DeVito puts on Phil's face convinces us that introspection and
salesmanship don't mix. But neither does the old glad-handing
extroversion. That's really what seems to have panicked Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' (the title refers to the big-bucks guy the
salesmen are chasing) doesn't bring any profound new insights to
its musings on American values. Many are on the fortune-cookie
level. But the pleasure of watching Spacey and DeVito work makes
the slenderness of the subject matter almost palatable. Roger
Rueff, who wrote the script from his play, does at least have an
update to offer. It has to do with the fact that while the sales
game remains the same, the moves are changing. What sells these
days is decreased obviousness about the selling. Which is why the
fresh-faced rookie, with his straight-arrow churchgoing and family
values agenda, embodies the latest sales tool _ authenticity. A
nice twist. It lifts ``The Big Kahuna'' out of the cheeseball
class, if not out of the carrot stick category. It's no meal, but
it'll tide you over.

THERE'S NO SAVING `BATTLEFIELD EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>

BATTLEFIELD EARTH 
Directed by: Roger Christian 
Screenplay by: Corey Mandell, J. D.Shapiro (novel: L. Ron Hubbard) 
Starring: John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kim Coates,
Richard Tyson, Sabine Karsenti 
Running time: 117 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' is yet another reminder that a book can
sell milions of copies, as this sci-fi best-seller has, and still
be so badly written that it defies even the most sustained
professional effort to bring it to anything like life. Its story of
a heroic man freeing the planet from enslaving alien monsters in
the year 3000 is so heavy and lifeless that you keep waiting for
those three little front-row kibitzers from ``Mystery Science
Theatre 3000'' to appear at the bottom of the screen to start
goofing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Although L. Ron Hubbard's novel was published in 1982, it has
the anachronistic flavor of the most generic pulp sci-fi of the
'50s. Essentially, it's Hollywood camp that not even the most
devoted ministrations of John Travolta, who spent almost two
decades getting the film made, can salvage. During that time he
aged from playing the lead to playing the bad guy. He can't make
the bad guy scary enough to make a difference, although he does
have fun playing the guy's hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Terl is his name and he's from a race of nine-foot bipeds called
Psychlos with six thick hairy clawed fingers on each hand, a
mouthful of bad teeth, and gray breathing tubes coming out of their
noses because Psychlos can't handle Earth's atmosphere. Despite his
respiratory problems, Darth Vader he's not. All he wants is gold,
and he's seething because he's been put in charge of security on
what he regards as a ratty little planet while his fellow Psychlos
finish strip-mining it.
</P>
<P>
   It's amusing that this heavy spends so much time playing
self-pity when he isn't torturing, killing, or doing nasty things
to everyone. Still, it's not nearly amusing enough in this film
that seems barely able to fend off a quality of amateurishness
having to do with clumsy plotting and less than comic-strip balloon
quality dialogue. ``Jonnie, I've always known this was going to be
your destiny,'' Sabine Karsenti's pretty cavewoman and
self-proclaimed lifelong mate cries, straight-faced, when the
earthling rebel is ready to kick the Psychlos off the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Never is it quite explained why the cave-dwelling humans living
in the snow-covered Rockies don't bundle up more. As it is, they
prance around scantily clad in bits of rag and the odd fur. To the
Psychlos, they're less than dogs, and when they're captured they're
penned in zoos when they're not doing forced labor in the mines.
When Barry Pepper's Jonnie Goodboy is looking for a concept to tie
his revolutionary impulses together, he conveniently is led to
what's left of the Denver Public Library and happens on a copy of
the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of weaponry and machinery, the Psychlos are leagues
ahead of the humans. But after one session in front of a learning
ray that shoots his brain full of Psychlo knowledge, Johnnie is
substituting ingots of Fort Knox gold for the Rocky Mountain
nuggets he's told to mine, piloting Psychlo flying craft, and
telling the others who have been sprung from the zoo that they've
got seven days to save the planet. This includes mastering a remote
control device that will enable them to destroy the purple Psychlo
planet, light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   But even the battle scenes plod. You perhaps see the problem
faced by ``Battlefield Earth.'' It's too clunky to be taken
seriously, too dumb to be taken as comedy, too formulaic to have
any real personality. A lot of effort has been expended on models
and explosions and dark, oppressive visuals that suggest early
steel mills. But the material it's being expended upon is too
intractable to work on any level. ``Battlefield Earth'' begins as
retro pulp, ends up, figuratively speaking, as tons of wet
cardboard.

RAPE VICTIMS MAY NOT SUE ATTACKERS IN FEDERAL COURT, SUPREME COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the part of a
1994 federal law that allowed female rape victims to sue their
attackers in federal court, ruling 5-4 that Congress had exceeded
its reach and ventured into the domain of the states.
</P>
<P>
   The majority, in an opinion written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, voided the section of the Violence Against Women Act
that gave rape victims the right to sue their attackers for civil
damages. Monday's ruling does not affect sections of the act
providing for criminal charges and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the law, Congress went too far in relying on its
constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce and to
enforce the 14th Amendment's equal-protection guarantees, the
Supreme Court said in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law had argued that violence against women had
a substantial effect on interstate commerce by deterring women from
taking certain jobs, furthering their educations or traveling
freely, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The case decided Monday concerned a freshman at Virginia Tech
who accused two football players of raping her in her dormitory
room in 1994. The student, Christy Brzonkala, sued in 1995 after
the school took no action against one of the players, James
Crawford, and gave the other, Antonio Morrison, a deferred
suspension that permitted him to keep playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Brzonkala did not file a complaint until several months after
the incident. Morrison maintained that the sex was consentual,
while Crawford denied any participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the allegations here are true,'' Rehnquist wrote, ``no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for
the conduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federal system
that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and
not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas in upholding
a ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond. The
case is United States vs. Morrison, 99-5.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lines of Monday's ruling had seemed predictable when the
case was argued on Jan. 11, setting off a spirited argument about
the relative powers of the federal government and the states _ an
issue the high court has been addressing often of late.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the five justices in the majority Monday told the
Clinton administration, which argued in favor of the civil claims
section of the law, that by extension its approach would call for
federal laws regarding alimony, child support and other areas that
are left to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices in Monday's minority suggested in January that
leaving the federal rape-suit provision intact would just be one of
many instances of federal and state laws that are more or less
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent Monday, Souter said Congress passed the law in
1994 because the states had been unable to curb gender-based
violence.
</P>
<P>
   And Souter noted the irony that while Monday's majority ruling
was protective of the states' constitutional powers, 36 states and
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had filed briefs asking the court
to rule the other way.

&HT;     TRIAL PUTS NEWSPAPER COMPANY IN UNCOMFORTABLE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Suddenly, one of the nation's biggest media
companies found itself uncomfortably in the news.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a relatively straightforward newspaper acquisition
_ the Hearst Corp.'s $660 million purchase of the San Francisco
Chronicle _ has become a public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   An antitrust suit to stop Hearst from buying the Chronicle and
selling its Examiner has turned into a corporate soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   One after another of privately held Hearst's executives has been
compelled to take the witness stand to answer questions about the
financial management of the Examiner, and about whether Hearst
sought to grab a newspaper monopoly in a town that loves freedom of
expression even more than gourmet food.
</P>
<P>
   All Hearst wanted to do was buy the Chronicle and turn it into
what it called a ``world-class newspaper.'' But on the second day
of trial the man whom it had picked to do that _ Examiner Publisher
Timothy O. White _ was suspended for having testified the day
before that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials in
return for Brown's support of Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The saga has cast a shadow on Hearst's avowed ``commitment to
journalistic excellence,'' media specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a quid pro quo offer, it's a nightmare,'' said
Frank Woods, a former editorial writer at the New Orleans
Times-Picayune who now teaches media ethics at the Poynter
Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timothy White essentially verified every fear expressed by our
readers, (that) we are for sale. I strongly believe he made an
offer that most journalists . . . would not have dreamed of, but
the public needs to be told that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied that White's superiors knew of his offer and
said the company puts a premium on the editorial independence of
its 12 daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value journalistic integrity as much as any other news
organization,'' said Debra Shriver, a Hearst spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no rush to judgment here. It has been a
difficult situation, involving a very well-liked, well-respected
colleague. We have done the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst put White on indefinite paid leave pending an internal
review by a former federal judge of whether White or others
violated journalistic ethics. In a Hearst press release, White said
he had been ``tired and confused'' during his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, White said that he had wanted to
return to the witness stand to explain his testimony but that
Hearst's lawyers said no.
</P>
<P>
   White said his remark to Brown was a ``conversational throwaway
line.'' He said his testimony made the comment sound more
substantial than it was. ``In truth, it meant nothing,'' White
said, adding, ``In hindsight, it's not the kind of comment that
should be made by a publisher to a mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has highlighted the inherent tension between every
media company's profit-driven business side and its news gathering
and editorializing side, two sections that are supposed to be as
separate as church and state.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a series of controversies involving clashes
between those interdependent parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In newspapers, magazines and certainly broadcasting, it's more
and more a concern,'' said Thomas Leonard, associate dean of
Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Los Angeles Times admitted _ without telling its
editorial staff _ that business executives had agreed to split the
profits from a special magazine on the Staples Center with the
sports center's owners. In a 1995 case dramatized in the movie
``The Insider,'' CBS allegedly sat on an expose of a tobacco
company while the network's parent company was negotiating a
business deal with the cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco case, several media specialists said they
have been most troubled by White's testimony that he offered to
trade favorable editorials for Brown's support of Hearst's purchase
of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Woods noted that, like the Staples Center case, White's offer
put the publisher's business interests above the paper's editorial
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they both have in common is a business-side promise to
deliver something journalistically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said trial testimony raised questions about
whether George B. Irish, president of Hearst's newspaper division,
and other Hearst executives knew of White's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jaw dropped when I read that,'' said Marion Lewenstein,
professor of communication at Stanford University. ``I find it
difficult to believe they didn't know this was going on. It seems
(White) is taking the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar stems from an Aug. 30 e-mail to Irish, in which White
reported on his lunch meeting earlier that day with Brown. ``I
asked Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in New York
wanting to support him and cooperate with him when he was seeming
to go out of his way to make our lives difficult,'' White wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Brown and other local politicians opposed Hearst's
purchase of the Chronicle and possible closing of the Examiner,
saying they wanted San Francisco to have at least two daily
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   White later testified that he did not need to justify any
editorial position to his superiors, but wanted Brown to think he
did. White said he was trying to convey to Brown that his support
for Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle would result in more
favorable editorial treatment for him in the Examiner's editorial
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Irish has testified that he did not know of the offer, though he
acknowledged that White had briefed him on at least two meetings in
which the publisher sought Brown's support for Hearst's purchase of
the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's lawyers have said White's offer to Brown is irrelevant
to the legal issue: Did Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle violate
antitrust laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds up to nothing,'' said Gerald Connell, a Hearst lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, the lawyer for the man who filed the antitrust
suit, claims White's offer was part and parcel of Hearst's effort
to engineer an illegal newspaper monopoly by buying the Chronicle
and selling its Examiner to the publishers of the San Francisco
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Reilly, who made an unsuccessful attempt to buy the
Examiner and the plaintiff in the antitrust case, is seeking an
order that permanently bars Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the trial has been a painful reminder that
newspapers are businesses in a competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   William Woo, former editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, said
that even if Hearst wins the antitrust case, White's testimony has
hurt Hearst's main stock in trade: credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truthfulness of the company is being brought into
question,'' said Woo, a Stanford journalism professor who also
teaches journalism ethics at UC-Berkeley. ``It has put the
journalistic credibility of the company at stake.''

   Flying Turns
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do birds turn in flight? They bank just like planes, but
their tails appear to offer no vertical rudder surface.
</P>
<P>
   A. The assumption that a bird's tail functions only as a
horizontal surface is erroneous, said Ron Rohrbaugh, an
ornithologist at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tail does function as a rudder,'' he said. ``A bird can
twist its tail laterally, from left to right, and downward, so it
acts almost as a braking system that allows it to bank into
turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Some birds are better at this than others, he continued. ``For
example,'' he said, ``some hawks in the group known as accipiters,
which spend most of the time in forested settings, use their tails
as rudders so they can rapidly weave their way through trees
without striking them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other turning mechanisms as well. ``Some birds, like
waterfowl, that have large webbed feet can use their feet to steer
during landing,'' Rohrbaugh said. ``The feet have a lot of surface
area, which creates wind resistance, and can be used much the way
other birds might use their tails to steer.''
</P>
<P>
   Birds also steer by changing their wing configuration. ``They
can change the angle of attack, which is simply the angle at which
the wing intersects the stream of air,'' Rohrbaugh said. ``A
greater angle of attack creates more wind resistance, and applying
this differentially on each wing allows the bird to turn.''

TORNADOES, HAILSTORMS AND FLATTENED ROOFS ATTRACTING TOURISTS TO
U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CRYSTAL YEDNAK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Flattened homes and overturned cars _ not
exactly the images tourism officials plaster on travel brochures.
</P>
<P>
   But the scenes of devastation from recent tornadoes are luring
some foreigners to the United States to spend vacations jaunting
through Tornado Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of the Denver-based Storm Chasing Adventure Tours fork
out $2,000 for a two-week trip chasing severe weather in a
radar-equipped van.
</P>
<P>
   Tour season kicked off April 22 and will run through June, with
the van crisscrossing through tornado-prone Texas and Oklahoma,
tour operator Todd Thorn said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, his group of mostly British travelers made a stop
in Fort Worth to fill up on gas, soda and fresh air. Having left
Waco in the morning, they were on their way to New Mexico to take a
break at Carlsbad Caverns.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Texas weather isn't cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some good thunderstorms, but we're yet to strike
lucky on a tornado,'' said Steve Wakeham, a meteorologist on the
tour from Norfolk, England.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in traffic near Dallas on Friday, the group also missed
the storms and deadly tornado that struck Hill and Bosque counties
south of the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeham said it is rare to find storms in England that are as
severe as those found in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Peering from under a sun visor, Rita Ashton of Cambridge,
England, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see some really big hailstones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms and cloud formations have fascinated Ashton since
childhood. Last year, she became particularly interested in
tornadoes after a British TV special on twisters that profiled some
storm chasers.
</P>
<P>
   So for her silver wedding anniversary, Ashton asked husband,
David, for a storm-chasing adventure tour for two through Tornado
Alley, which includes parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   She is fascinated with the power nature has, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can predict it but you can't do anything to stop it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A weather tourist's day starts with a check of the radars to
seek the best potential sites for severe weather. With an average
of 168 tornadoes a year, Texas is often a destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is bigger in America, especially Texas,'' said
Wayne Webster, 25, of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Driving from storm to storm takes up most of the time. The group
may log hundreds of miles a day in the tour van, which is equipped
with a radar, satellite equipment to bring in uninterrupted Weather
Channel signals, a lightning detection monitor, computers and
radios. Each of the seven tourists can watch the Weather Channel on
TV monitors in the van as they head to the next destination.
</P>
<P>
   But 1,300 miles, three days, a few books and several CDs into
this trip, Jon Nicholson still hasn't seen what he came all the way
from Cambridge, England, to see _ the power of nature such as the
March 28 tornadoes in Fort Worth and adjacent Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado chasing first intrigued Nicholson after watching TV
coverage last year of the deadly Oklahoma tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   But tornadoes are not promised on every trip, Thorn said, even
though just about every other group sees one.
</P>
<P>
   A previous tour group had a bit more excitement, coming up on
the path of a tornado minutes after it touched down in Shreveport,
La., said Webster. He had a van seat on that first tour of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had to stop in our tracks because a tornado was
passing five miles south of us. It was so exciting,'' said Webster,
who works as an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   In his hometown of Dundee, Webster said he and friends drive up
to the mountains to watch lightning coming over the peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, heavy rains and maybe some hail are the most South
African weather-watchers can count on. Webster said he made the
trip to Texas specifically to see a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the violence and the lightning and the thunder, that's
what I enjoy the most,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Biggerstaff, faculty adviser to the Texas A&AMP;M Severe Storms
Data Acquisition Team, said tornadoes fascinate people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that in Oklahoma there are so many people
chasing storms that you almost can't drive down the highways,''
Biggerstaff said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased popularity has prompted concern that weather
enthusiasts could put themselves in harm's way, but Biggerstaff
added that he is unaware of injuries resulting from any organized
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the movie ``Twister'' helped popularize storm
chasing, Biggerstaff said. Weather information has also become much
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   For less than $2,000, weather-watchers can outfit their vehicles
with radars, laptops and TV monitors to track weather with near
precision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that they always find the tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn cited the difficulties in seeking out tornadoes and timing
the group's arrival within a few minutes of a twister touching
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be like finding a needle in a haystack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the customers come for the thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like with parachuting or bungee jumping, they go for the
thrill,'' he said. ``And the unknown amount of danger in it.''

   Io's Potent Moondust
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, a major volcanic eruption can spew billions of cubic
yards of ash and dust into the air. From there, it can be
distributed throughout the atmosphere and deflect enough sunlight
to lower temperatures worldwide for several years, as the massive
Krakatoa eruption did in 1883.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, yes, but nothing like what an extraterrestrial
volcano can do, to judge from recent research involving Jupiter's
moon Io, which scientists consider to be the most active volcanic
body in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Germany and Norway, analyzing data from the
Galileo spacecraft, which has been orbiting Jupiter since 1995,
have determined that volcanoes on Io are the source of streams of
dust that flow from the area of Jupiter into the rest of the solar
system. These dust streams, which were first discovered in 1992,
flow out about 175 million miles, or nearly twice the distance of
the Earth to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, reporting on their work in Nature, analyzed the
frequency of peak impacts on Galileo's dust detector. They found
that the peaks coincided with the periods of Io's orbit and
Jupiter's rotation. The dust, made up of tiny grains as small as
particles of smoke, is strongly affected by Jupiter's magnetic
field. Further study may provide insight into how the much more
abundant dust in the early days of the solar system behaved under
the influence of the sun's magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Spices as Shields
</P>
<P>
   They are not suggesting that a meal of chicken vindaloo might be
the best protection in the event of World War III, but scientists
in India have made the intriguing discovery that certain spices can
prevent bacteria from being destroyed by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in The Journal of Agricultural and
Food Chemistry, found that chili powder offered E. coli and other
bacteria the best protection against gamma rays, followed by black
pepper and turmeric. Antioxidants and perhaps other compounds in
the spices were found to help protect the bacterial DNA from
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists noted that the spices offered only limited
protection, and that in irradiation of processed foods, the dosage
levels are high enough to kill off all bacteria, no matter how
spicy the dish. But the researchers suggest that their work may
someday lead to the use of spice extracts to protect healthy
tissues in people undergoing radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino, the Ancient
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency to think of El Nino as a new phenomenon, as
modern as alternate side of the street parking, say, or microwave
popcorn. Scientists who study climate history, however, know that
El Nino events, when the waters of the eastern Pacific warm up and
influence the weather worldwide, have occurred for at least 5,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   Make that at least 17,500 years, according to researchers at the
University of Massachusetts. Writing in the journal Science, the
researchers describe evidence of a three- to five-year cycle of El
Nino events during the late part of the last ice age.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence was found not by trekking to the edge of the
Earth, but rather to the edge of the UMass campus in Amherst. The
scientists studied cores taken from a site usually used for
research on civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The cores were made up of sediments deposited toward the end of
the ice age, when what is known as the Laurentide Ice Sheet was
receding, leaving a huge lake that covered most of what is now the
Connecticut River Valley. The thickness of the annual sediment
layers in the cores reflects how fast the ice sheet was melting.
The researchers found that there was a cyclical variability in the
thick layers, when the warmth of El Nino events would have caused
the ice to melt faster.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that by showing that El Nino events
occurred under such vastly different conditions all those years
ago, their work will help scientists understand more about the
phenomenon today.

 &HT;    INTERNET CRIMINALS STAYING ONE CLICK AHEAD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The world's law-enforcement agencies are struggling to
keep pace with Internet criminals who strike without warning and
then slip nearly unseen into cyberspace leaving behind few clues,
officials at an international cyber-crime conference said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference, organized by the G8 group of
industrialized nations, is the first international gathering of law
enforcers, business representatives and government officials to
address the burgeoning problem of cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual crimewave is accompanying the surge in worldwide
Internet use that is forcing authorities to develop new sets of
skills to counter rivals who are developing sophisticated new scams
at rate that far outpaces conventional police tactics, industry and
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, because the Internet has no national borders
authorities are hampered as they pursue cyber-criminals across
jurisdictions where laws and customs often have not been brought up
to date.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, the chief scientist at Intel Corp., said that
government and industry leaders are beginning to find some
consensus in how to approach the problems of Internet crime but the
gap remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has outpaced any of our ability to agree on
some of the social ramifications of it,'' said Aucsmith, one of the
industry leaders at the conference. ``The technology is much easier
to evolve than are policies or laws.''
</P>
<P>
   James Robinson, head of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal
division, said law-enforcement officials confront a dizzying array
of issues in combating cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said cyber-criminals ``can sit at a laptop and commit a
crime across the street and weave it through seven countries and
pretty soon you don't have any idea where it's coming from,''
Robinson told reporters at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   International protocols will have to be changed to allow
investigators to move through various jurisdictions quickly. ``When
things are moving at such a speed, you can't sit there and work for
months and months to wait to have things translated and go through
this process,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the interests of law-enforcement agencies often
are in conflict with the desires of computer users to protect the
secrecy of their transactions and privacy of their communications,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tension between finding a way to secure the system
to minimize misuses that still allows us to do the job we need to
do,'' he said. ``We all think about coming across encrypted
communications ... that may involve terrorist acts or kidnapping or
other ... criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials say that it is very difficult to measure the
scope of Internet crime, there is a consensus that is growing
rapidly. The FBI opened an online fraud complaint center last
Monday and received 3,700 complaints in the first 3 1/2 days. ``We
were frankly kind of surprised because it isn't well-known, yet,''
said Tom Packard, the FBI's delegate at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heightened concerns about fraud with the explosion of
online financial transactions, many industry officials say they
worry more about viruses, such as the ``Love Bug'' variant that
struck hundreds of thousands of computers a week and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of serious crime is not that significant at the
moment,'' said Aucsmith of Intel, which produces the ubiquitous
Pentium microprocessors. ``However, the average person using the
Internet is actually subject to a considerable amount of attack.
Those attacks are the equivalent of cyberspace vandalism. They're
not fraud., not someone robbing you.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard said he was concerned by the apparent trust people put
in information on the Internet. ``What's more troubling to me is
the way people view the internet, and if it's on the Internet they
seem to be more trusting of it or more believing in it whether it's
a news article that they read in the Internet or baseball cards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest issues facing the conference is defining
the limits of industry self-regulation. Generally, Internet
companies resist government involvement, seeing in it a potential
form of censorship and an invitation to let states meddle with the
sector's organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer fighting cyber-crime with technical innovation,
educating users and companies about security risks, and making
better use of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   A conference delegate, Stephanie Perrin, chief privacy officer
at a Canadian company, Zero-Knowledge Systems. Inc., said firms,
while eager to uphold the law, are suspicious of ``extending the
arm of law enforcers into the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates hope the conference will develop a consensus on basic
principles in policing cyberspace. However, it is unlikely to
produce any sweeping multi-national policies. It ends Wednesday and
will report its conclusions to the G8 summit in Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 comprises the G7 group - Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - plus Russia.

RUSSIA FAILED TO ARREST YUGOSLAV GENERAL INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ The Yugoslav defense minister, Gen. Dragoljub
Ojdanic, indicted for war crimes during the Kosovo conflict, spent
five days on an official visit to Moscow last week without being
arrested by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic, who was the Yugoslav army chief of staff during the
Kosovo war last year, is believed to be the first publicly indicted
Yugoslav official to travel outside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and three
other officials, Ojdanic was indicted a year ago, on May 26, by the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on
charges of crimes against humanity and violation of the laws and
customs of war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal itself was established by the U.N. Security
Council, of which Russia is one of five permanent members. All
member states of the United Nations are supposed to arrest indicted
war criminals if possible.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian press reports printed the day after he
left, Ojdanic arrived in Moscow on May 7, coinciding with the
inauguration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ojdanic
reportedly met with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and attended the
May 9 military parade marking the end of World War II. He left
Moscow on May 12, after apparently helping to prepare the visit of
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, who arrived in Moscow
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, a spokesman for the tribunal, said the chief
prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, ``is alarmed by these reports.'' In a
telephone interview, Risley said Del Ponte would ask Moscow about
the reports ``and why a person indicted before the tribunal was not
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been a traditional ally of Yugoslavia and the Serbs
but helped the West negotiate an end to the war in Kosovo. Russian
troops also serve with U.N. peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.

BUSH-HATERS MAY HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bush-haters must be discouraged. They haven't been swamping
me with nasty e-mails, scathing letters and vitriolic phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   These folks object to being described as ``Bush-haters,'' by the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate George W. Bush,'' they always say. ``I just don't
think that stupid, smug, smirking so-and-so is qualified to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose they'd say if they hated him?
</P>
<P>
   I've never been able to figure out what it is about the Texas
governor that invites so much antagonism. He is a perfectly
pleasant person with a self-deprecating sense of humor and a
sincere sense of gratitude for the success that he has achieved in
both the private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these people apparently loathe Bush with a passion
not unlike that of the Clinton-haters who look upon every word and
deed of the current president as a personal affront.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Bush-haters were ecstatic when the Republican
presidential nominee-to-be seemed to stumble in some of the early
primaries. They were thrilled by the media-driven John McCain
uprising that temporarily rattled the Bush campaign and sapped his
record-setting campaign bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   But then Bush crushed McCain's challenge, secured the nomination
and set about the business of gearing up for the general election
campaign against Democrat Al Gore. The Bush-haters were despondent.
</P>
<P>
   And they grow more despondent every day as poll after poll shows
Bush edging past Gore in the ``horse race'' phase of the campaign _
and also expanding his appeal among the various voter groups whose
support will eventually add up to victory in the Electoral College.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that Bush has erased the ``gender gap''
that was so crucial to Bill Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996.
At least two polls, in fact, show Bush with a slight lead over Gore
among female voters _ a group that could very well decide the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, Bush-haters: The compassionate conservative is on a
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was definitely one of the best he's had since nailing
down his party's nomination way back in March. Bush racked up
impressive numbers in several polls, won an endorsement from McCain
and came up with a flurry of policy initiatives. His proposal to
provide free trigger locks to gun owners was perfectly timed to
coincide with Sunday's Million Mom March in support of gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also fared well on the TV interview circuit, answering
questions in a confident and succinct manner that refuted his
detractors' frequent claim that he is less than competent in such
forums.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, seems to be mired in quicksand. He has settled
into a boring and redundant pattern of false and/or irrelevant
attacks against Bush that are guaranteed to provoke yawns, if not
flat-out hostility, from voters. The vice president even enlisted
the aid of the Great Attacker, Clinton, who said that Bush would
appoint Supreme Court justices who are committed to repealing the
Roe vs. Wade decision that guarantees abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as Clinton well knows, has said again and again that he
will apply no such ``litmus test'' in his judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly understandable that the Clinton-Gore crowd would
resort to fiction in their criticism of Bush, since Bush would
prevail in any honest comparison of the Bush and Gore visions for
the nation's future. After Gore rips the Bush tax-cut plan as a
``risky scheme'' and terrorizes senior citizens with preposterous
characterizations of Bush's plan to save Social Security, the vice
president doesn't have much going for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could make the argument _ and probably will, if he gets
desperate enough _ that a Gore presidency would be just like four
more years of Clintonism. Talk about your risky schemes.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for the anti-Bush folks, I know. But don't
despair, Bush-haters; after he wins the election on Nov. 7, you'll
have four whole years to complain about him.

&HT;     TOURISM ON THE RISE IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Stands for HONG-KONG)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, tourism in East Asia was still reeling
from the financial crisis that battered the region in 1997 and
1998, with hotels, airlines and tour operators sharing the pain.
</P>
<P>
   All that is beginning to change, according to tourism
representatives gathered at the 49th annual conference of the
Pacific Asia Travel Association in Hong Kong earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   PATA, based in San Francisco from 1953 until the association
moved to Bangkok in 1998, is a worldwide trade organization for the
travel industry. PATA meetings are, accordingly, major
schmoozefests for tourism board officials, business executives and
politicians. Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, welcomed
the group in the spectacular convention center on the edge of
Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   According to numbers-crunchers at the PATA conference, tourism _
a bellwether business in the region _ is surging. Hotel occupancy
rates are up, the number of passengers on trans-Pacific flights is
rising, airlines are adding flights and buying new planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the middle of 1999, we have seen the return of growth
and confidence across almost all of Asia,'' said David Turnbull,
the chief executive at Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways.
Turnbull said the airline's passenger traffic grew 8 percent in the
first three months of 2000, and its cargo business increased by 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong _ Asia's most popular destination, with some 11
million visitors a year _ is a case study in economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong counted 1.9 million tourists in January and February,
a healthy 12.2 percent jump over the same months in 1999, according
to the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
   Lillibeth Bishop, the HKTA's publicity and promotions manager
for the Americas, attributed the dramatic rebound to ``improving
economies, competition among airlines, trade promotions and
positive media publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for countries that depend on the millions of
tourists and the billions of dollars they spend _ and an
encouraging sign for investors and U.S. multinationals waiting for
the Asian tigers to regain their roar.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good news across the Pacific in San Francisco, where
tourism generates revenues of $6.5 billion per year, according to
the San Francisco Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. Presumably, when
East Asian economies recover fully, and their citizens resume
traveling abroad in large numbers, tourist towns like San Francisco
will benefit, too.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, growth in two-way international air traffic is
driving development of San Francisco International Airport's new
$944 million International Terminal, which is set to open Sept. 26.
International travel is growing twice as fast as domestic travel,
according to airport spokesman Ron Wilson. Traffic to and from Asia
outpaced growth in other areas through most of the 1990s, Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nearly back to where we were before the Asian crisis,''
Wilson said.

   SOCIAL-SECURITY (Undated) _ Texas Gov. George Bush and Vice
President Al Gore campaign at opposite ends of the country, each
touting his plan for Social Security. Bush outlines a proposal that
would allow some investment of Social Security money in the stock

accounts _ would drain Social Security of funds needed to guarantee

<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. _ In medieval times, right-handed swordsmen had a
distinct advantage. They held their shield with their left hand _
over their heart _ and thus lived to fight another day, and to
reproduce, even after they had been stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   That, suggested Thomas Carlyle, the 19th century British writer,
is why so many more people are right-handed. The lefties never
lived to have offspring.
</P>
<P>
   It is a preposterous theory. Chances are, Carlyle, a brilliant
essayist and himself left-handed, offered it tongue in cheek to
tweak his contemporary Charles Darwin, whom he did not care for.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the question of what causes people to be
right-handed or left-handed is nearly as much of a mystery today as
it was when Carlyle addressed it in 1871.
</P>
<P>
   The latest word comes from a geneticist at the National Cancer
Institute laboratory here who has been working for years with yeast
and mutant mice and who has developed a novel theory that he
believes will explain why 9 out of 10 people in all cultures are
right-handed, why left-handed parents are more likely to have
left-handed children and why identical twins often have different
handedness.
</P>
<P>
   The geneticist, Dr. Amar J.S. Klar, hypothesizes that most
people have a specific dominant gene that makes them right-handed.
About 20 percent of people, under this theory, lack the
right-handed gene, and these people without the gene have a 50-50
possibility _ a random chance _ of being right-handed or
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a person has or lacks this gene, Klar supposes, is a
function of conventional genetics, just like eye color or baldness.
</P>
<P>
   The gene has yet to be identified _ assuming it exists. Klar is
assembling a group of about 100 families that he plans to subject
to genetic testing. If everything goes right, he said in an
interview in his lab, he hopes to be able to prove his theory by
isolating a right-handed gene, perhaps within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Across the continent, at the University of British Columbia in
Vancouver, Dr. Stanley Coren, a psychologist, has been working for
years to document his view that left-handedness has nothing to do
with genetic variables and almost everything to do with prenatal
traumas _ with some sort of stress that damages the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers around the world do not take the all-or-nothing
stands of Klar and Coren but hold that both genetics and
development are involved. But what are the genetic elements? What
are the developmental ones? There is no consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what causes handedness is interesting as a
matter of curiosity and pure science. It is hard to think of
another behavioral difference so observable and so fundamental that
has not been explained.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a practical reason to want to know the answer.
Left-handedness is closely identified with mental illnesses like
schizophrenia and language difficulties like dyslexia and
stuttering. If scientists knew the connection, they might be better
able to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in handedness per se,'' Klar said. ``I'm
interested in how the brain works, and handedness is the only
external feature we can monitor, because we can't look at the brain
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in India, Klar, who is right-handed, came to
this country to attend graduate school at the University of
Wisconsin and did postdoctoral work at the University of California
at Berkeley. Before going to the National Cancer Institute, he
worked under Dr. James D. Watson (a lefty), the co-discoverer of
the structure of DNA, at the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   His studies of handedness, he said, began with his interest in
the fact that yeast, single-cell organisms, have two distinct
sides. His theory about the right-handed gene and the absence of
this gene in lefties, he said, grew out of studies of mutant mice.
</P>
<P>
   In most mice, the heart is on the left side. But there is a
mutant strain of mice that have hearts on the right. When the
mutants mate, half the offspring have hearts on the left and half
on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Klar said, geneticists identified a gene that is
present in normal mice but totally missing in the mutants. ``If it
can work in mice,'' Klar asked, ``why can't it work for handedness
in people?''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the theory is that it explains a phenomenon that
has long baffled geneticists: how can identical twins with exactly
the same genetic makeup have different handedness, as 18 percent of
them do? Klar's explanation is that these twins lack the
right-handed gene, and each one has an equal chance of being
right-handed or left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses as inconclusive studies that militate against his
genetic theory, showing that more men than women are left-handed
and that left-handed mothers have a disproportionate number of
left-handed sons. Possibly, he said, these findings can be
explained by cultural factors like a tendency of left-handed males
to be more stubborn than left-handed females in resisting efforts
to switch them to using their right hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prove his hypothesis, Klar plans to test blood samples
or cheek swabs from the members of 100 families in which at least
one parent is right-handed and two of the children are left-handed.
``I'm looking for markers in their DNA to see how often these
particular children inherit particular markers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a rigid definition of what constitutes right-handedness.
He asks people which hand they use to throw a ball, use a spoon,
saw, sew, shoot marbles, bowl, cut with a knife, cut with scissors,
hammer and write. He does not consider people right-handed who
routinely use their left hands for any of these activities.
</P>
<P>
   As a research biologist who spends his life testing hypotheses,
Klar said, he is all too familiar with going down blind alleys. But
he said he was confident he would be able to isolate the
right-handed gene.
</P>
<P>
   Others experts wonder. One skeptic is Coren, the psychologist in
British Columbia, who created a splash about a decade ago with his
book, ``The Left-Handed Syndrome'' (Free Press, 1992), which
maintains that lefties die younger and are more prone to accidents
than right-handers. (Coren's avocation, incidentally, is writing
about dogs, and he has published such page-turners as ``How to
Speak Dog'' and ``What Do Dogs Know?'')
</P>
<P>
   Coren is convinced that humans are naturally right-handed and
that left-handedness is largely a consequence of what he calls
``birth stress,'' by which he means factors like an unnatural
placement that causes damage to the fetus in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Prenatal brain injuries explain why a larger percentage of
left-handers have psychological and emotional problems, he said. He
believes left-handedness runs in families because of a
predisposition of the women in those families to have difficult
pregnancies. As for the paradox of identical twins, he said twins
are always subjected to birth stress because of crowding in the
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scientists who have studied handedness _ Dr. Walter F.
McKeever, a psychologist at the University of Toledo in Ohio, and
Dr. Daniel H. Geschwind, a neurologist at the University of
California at Los Angeles _ said they believed that handedness was
heavily based in genetics. They said they doubted a single gene was
responsible, as Klar suggests. They give more weight than Klar to
developmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handedness is a complex behavior,'' Geschwind said, ``and no
complex behavior has ever been shown to be due to only a single
gene without any environmental influence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klar is undaunted. ``What's good for yeast should be good
for mice, and what's good for mice should be good for men,'' he
said. ``Biology is biology, and DNA is DNA.''

GOLFERS IMPROVE THEIR BODIES _ AND THEIR GAME _ THANKS TO A FITNESS
REGIMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not many people would associate professional golfers with
fitness. In his prime, Arnold Palmer was fairly athletic-looking
but always had a cigarette dangling from his lips. The young Jack
Nicklaus was called ``Fat Jack.'' And among today's golfers, Craig
Stadler, John Daly and Colin Montgomerie look like candidates for
the Slim Fast diet.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's reputation is built on the image of paunchy weekend
duffers traversing the fairways in golf carts, heading for the 19th
hole for a few beers after completing their round.
</P>
<P>
   But now, some of the younger professionals are threatening to
spoil it for those who think of golf more as a leisurely pursuit
than athletic event.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, golf's reputation as the perfect ``game'' for business
executives who want to relax and unwind _ no matter what their age
or how many hours a day they spend sitting behind a desk _ just may
be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   When David Duval tees off at the Colonial golf tournament this
week in Fort Worth, looking like a cover boy for Men's Health
magazine, and when Tiger Woods is seen fine-tuning his body at
local health clubs during tournaments, you can't help but make the
fitness connection.
</P>
<P>
   Today's professional golfers, men and women, are bigger, more
flexible and more powerful than ever, says Keith Kleven, a physical
therapist who works with a number of professional golfers,
including Woods, Mark O'Meara, Chris Riley and John Cook at his
clinic in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The best golfers today are more health conscious and into
rigorous daily training, including weight lifting, flexibility
exercises, aerobic conditioning and sport-specific training to
enhance body mechanics, says Kleven, a spokesman for the American
Physical Therapy Association.
</P>
<P>
   Duval exemplifies the movement. He has buffed up and trimmed
down, reportedly losing more than 30 pounds in the past three
years, including 15 since last fall when he decided to make
physical fitness a priority. His rigorous conditioning program
includes eating a fat-free diet, lifting weights and running four
to eight miles most days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Posture and mechanics are the key in golf _ and the right
exercises to increase strength, power and endurance,'' Kleven said
in a recent telephone interview. ``Power is the most important
thing, and that's a combination of strength and speed with freedom
of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Physical Therapy Association is using this PGA season to
emphasize that a health-conscious approach is just as important to
amateur golfers as it is to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pros make it look easy, but the golf swing is actually one
of the most difficult and complicated movements among all sports,
requiring stability in some joints and flexibility in others,''
Kleven says. ``Bending the knees before swinging, rotating the hips
and spine during the golf swing and using proper range of motion
techniques throughout the swing play a large role in preventing
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleven works with golfers on proper exercise and progression in
their personal fitness programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to help them maintain and increase
the balance between different muscles and bodily structures. They
need flexibility at the highest level for freedom of joint movement
in the spine and the extremities,'' he says. ``Flexibility is as
important as form.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries in golf are not usually the result of acute trauma from
direct contact or any outside influences, but rather from not
having the body conditioned to avoid the consequences of stress and
overuse, repetitive motions that cause trauma over a period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   And, it doesn't have to be every day.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend golfers have a tendency to swing with the speed and
force of a professional, often without warming up, and often after
sitting at a desk all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the weekend comes, they hit the links and blast the golf
balls as far as possible. Seven to eight times a golfer's weight is
compressed into the spine with every swing,'' Kleven says. ``With
this kind of force, it is easy to damage discs and strain muscles.
The most common injuries among golfers involve the spine, including
the upper and lower back and neck.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A GOLFER'S WARM-UP
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing aerobic conditioning is an essential component of golf
fitness, and strength training is an excellent injury-prevention
tool that can ultimately help golfers improve their game, but
warm-up stretching may be the most important fitness component for
both amateurs and pros.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is as important as form. Make a habit of warming up
and stretching, says Keith Kleven, a spokesman for the American
Physical Therapy Association.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers should spend at least 20 minutes warming up and
stretching all the major muscle groups, especially the lower back
and the lower extremities, before practice or play.
</P>
<P>
   You shouldn't wait until you're on the course before stretching
because that is neither practical nor conducive to a thorough
stretch, Kleven says.
</P>
<P>
   To keep endurance up and muscles warm and conditioned, he
suggests golfers walk the course whenever possible, rather than
take a cart.

SCI-HANDEDNESS-FAME) c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ About 90 percent of people are right-handed. Most of the rest
are distinctly left-handed, though some are ambidextrous to one
degree or another.
</P>
<P>
   _ When both parents are right-handed, 92 percent of their
children are. When one parent is left-handed, about 80 percent of
the children are right-handed. When both parents are left-handed,
about half their children are right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left-handedness runs in families. In the British royal family,
for example, the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles
and Prince William are all left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Males are somewhat more likely than females to be left-handed.
There is some evidence that the children of left-handed mothers and
right-handed fathers are more likely to be left-handed than are the
children of right-handed mothers and left-handed fathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a striking 18 percent of identical twins, products of the
same egg with exactly the same genetic makeup, one twin is
right-handed and the other left-handed. There also seems to be a
higher proportion of fraternal twins with different handedness than
is the case with other siblings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The left hemisphere of the brain controls the motor
coordination of right-handed people, and the right hemisphere
controls it in lefties. In almost all instances, the speech and
language of right-handed people are controlled by the left side of
their brain. But in left-handed people, the right hemisphere
controls speech and language in at least 30 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   _ A much larger percentage of young people than old people are
left-handed. This may be, as one researcher suggests, because
lefties die earlier. Or it may be because in an earlier time,
natural lefties were taught to write and perform other tasks with
their right hands and now think of themselves as right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A disproportionate number of lefties seem to be geniuses
(Einstein), artists (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Picasso) and athletes
(Babe Ruth). A disproportionate number also seem to be criminals
(Jack the Ripper, Billy the Kid).
</P>
<P>
   _ Except for Jimmy Carter, every president for the last
quarter-century has been left-handed. There is no question about
Gerald R. Ford, George Bush or Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan writes
and eats with his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmund Morris, the Reagan biographer, has little doubt that
Reagan is a natural lefty who is one of those who were trained to
use their right hands. In the movies, Morris says, Reagan always
twirled and shot pistols with his left hand, and as president, he
always waved with his left hand. The presidential string is about
to be broken. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are
both right-handed.

   THERAPIES: For Strokes, a Snake Oil With Results
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that a purified form of snake venom can
act as an effective ``clot busting'' drug to lessen the damage of
strokes, potentially joining a growing arsenal of anti-stroke
medications.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published last Wednesday in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, represented the largest trial to date
of ancrod, a substance derived from Malaysian pit vipers. Over five
years, 500 patients suffering acute strokes were assigned to
receive infusions of ancrod or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. David Sherman of the University of
Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, reported that 42
percent of patients receiving ancrod regained ``favorable
functional status'' compared with 34 percent of the placebo group,
and that fewer patients receiving the venom were left severely
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial that accompanied the article noted that ancrod is
not likely to replace the standard therapy, known as tPA, which is
easier to administer and has shown slightly better results. The
more promising line of research opened by the new study, it said,
is into ways of combining ancrod, tPA and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the editorial said, the results of tests of ancrod
and tPA underscore the need to educate the public about the
symptoms of stroke and the urgency of seeking treatment, since both
drugs can be given safely only within three hours of the onset of
the attack.

   PREVENTION: Building Lyme Immunity in Children
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine against Lyme disease, so far given only to adults,
has been found to be safe and effective in children as young as 4,
according to research presented on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the vaccine appears to work better in children than
adults, said the study's lead author, Dr. Neal Halsey of the Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health. Speaking at a joint meeting of the
Pediatric Academic Societies and the American Academy of Pediatrics
in Boston, Halsey said that children ages 4 to 14 appeared to get
the same level of protection after two shots that adults got from
three.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was given to 3,063 children and 1,024 were given a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of children receiving the vaccine did report slightly
higher rates of reactions like fever, headache and joint pain, but
these were described as mild and short-lived. After 13 months, all
of the children receiving the vaccine were found to have developed
immunity to the disease, Halsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study will be reviewed by the Food and Drug
Administration, which will decide whether to approve the vaccine,
known as Limerix, for use in children.

<P>
   SAFETY: When Excess Water Can Kill a Runner
</P>
<P>
   Runners who get dehydrated face obvious dangers, but drinking
too much water during a race can also be deadly, according to a
study in this month's issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen Arieff of the University of California at San
Francisco and researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
investigated seven cases in which runners who collapsed after a
marathon were found to be suffering hyponatremia, a shortage of
salt in the blood. One of the runners died.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other similar fatalities have been reported from
marathons. Arieff said he suspected that other deaths after
marathons were misidentified as heart attacks instead of
hyponatremia.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of dehydration have led to a mistaken belief that the safe
thing to do in a marathon ``is to drink as much as you can, as
often as you can,'' Arieff said.
</P>
<P>
   A complicated chain of metabolic events can lead to trouble, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise leads the body to release antidiurectic hormone, which
block normal elimination of excess fluid as urine. (Taking drugs
like ibuprofen can strengthen this effect, said Arieff.)
</P>
<P>
   During a race, so much blood is diverted to the muscles that the
intestines are unable to absorb the water a runner drinks. Once the
race ends, however, that water floods into the blood stream,
disrupting the body's salt balance. This can cause the brain to
swell, which in turn sets off a mechanism that releases water into
the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment for the condition is simple: add more salt to the
bloodstream. But the fluid in the lungs and the circumstances of
the collapse often lead emergency room doctors to suspect heart
trouble and to order treatments that make things worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how much water is enough? That varies from athlete to
athlete, Arieff said, and is definitely not a function of how
thirsty you feel. He recommends that marathoners weigh themselves
before and after a trial run, say a half-marathon, to figure out
how much water they will lose. And that's more or less the amount
they should drink, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: The Price of Ending `Drive-By Deliveries'
</P>
<P>
   A Pennsylvania law against ``drive-by deliveries'' _ limits set
by insurance companies on how long mothers and their newborn
infants can remain in the hospital _ has succeeded in extending the
average length of stay, but at a cost that may outweigh the law's
benefits, according to a study released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Greenspan and Dr. Jennifer Culhane, neonatologists at
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, compiled data on all
births in the city for two years before and two years after passage
of the law, which required that insurers cover at least 48 hours of
hospitalization for mothers and infants after vaginal deliveries
and 96 hours after Caesarean deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the average length of mothers' hospital stays
rose from 34 to 48 hours, and that the median cost rose from $5,200
to $6,800, with similar trends for infants. That added up to an
increased health care bill of $20 million to $25 million a year in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incredible increase in costs suggests that we might come
up with a better model to improve comfort and care and outcomes,''
Greenspan said. ``For $1,600, you can get a whole lot of outpatient
services that might have a bigger impact.''
</P>
<P>
   NUTRITION: A Dose of Fiber for Diabetes Regimen
</P>
<P>
   Fiber's reputation as a defense against cancer has taken a
beating lately, but a new study reported last week in The New
England Journal of Medicine reaffirms its value as a treatment for
adult onset diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the researchers examined 13 patients who spent six
weeks on a diet that followed the American Dietary Association
guidelines and six weeks on a diet that contained significantly
more fiber than specified in the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   When the patients were on the high fiber diet, their daily
plasma glucose concentrations were 10 percent lower, and other
measures dropped by similarly significant amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are from the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, both in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial that accompanied their report, Dr. Marc Rendell
of the Creighton Diabetes Center in Omaha noted that the
improvement was roughly equivalent to the usual effect of adding
another drug to &QC; the treatment regimen of a diabetic patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more desirable first to take full advantage of the
improvements that can be attained by dietary modification,'' before
adding medicine to medicine, he wrote.

&HT;     SAY CHEESE: ODD SPORTING HABITS ARE VERY BRITISH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the last Monday in May, the semi-besotted young men of
Gloucestershire, England, will gather atop treacherously steep
Cooper's Hill to renew one of the strangest traditions in the
history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   A local dignitary will let loose an 8-pound wheel of Double
Gloucester cheese, and the young men will hurl their bodies down
the hill in pursuit. In theory, whoever catches the bouncing,
bounding wheel gets to keep it; in practice, no one ever does.
Whoever gets to the bottom of the hill first is awarded the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to Roman times and perhaps earlier, it's a brutal,
full-contact sport. Bodies cartwheel down the hill, fanny-over-tea
kettle. Limbs and ankles twist and snap. Contestants and wayward
cheese wheels hurtle into the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances line the bottom of the hill, and each year they're
kept busy carting bloodied contestants and spectators off to the
hospital. In 1995, 18 out of 20 entrants were injured. The
following year there were 33 casualties, the year after that 27.
</P>
<P>
   As the carnage mounted, the event was cancelled in 1998 while
the organizers decided on safety measures. They added new crash
barriers and a rescue team and, most importantly, moved the race
from 6 p.m. to noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stops people having too much to drink before they come,''
explained Richard Jeffries, one of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to have worked: only one contestant was hospitalized
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since my wife Jeri and I hiked past Cooper's Hill on the
Cotswold Way 10 years ago, I've been morbidly fascinated with the
bizarre and peculiar sporting scene of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing gives the English more pleasure, in a quiet but
determined sort of way, than to do things oddly,'' wrote Bill
Bryson in ``Notes from a Small Island.'' This goes doubly for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cotswolds market town of Chipping Campden, for example,
they engage in the sport of ``shin kicking.'' A featured attraction
of the Dover Games in early June, it was banned from 1852 to 1952.
But, as one guidebook put it, ``it has been enthusiastically
revived by the town's orthopedic surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Customs and Ceremonies of Britain,'' the
following sports were once regularly practiced at British festivals
and celebrations: ``Grinning for the cake,'' ``Jumping in the bag''
and ``Chattering for a bladder of snuff by old women.'' Alas, the
book is cruelly silent about the details of these pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these practices, though, is as perversely odd and
cringe-producing as the Yorkshire sport of ferret-legging.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how Donald Katz described the sport in a 1983 article in
Outside Magazine: ``Basically, ferret-legging involves the tying of
a competitor's trousers at the ankles and the insertion into those
trousers of a couple of peculiarly vicious fur-coated, foot-long
carnivores called ferrets. The brave contestant's belt is then
pulled tight, and he proceeds to stand there in front of the judges
as long as he can, while animals with claws like hypodermic needles
and teeth like number 16 carpet tacks try their damnedest to get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that these are hunting ferrets _ which
apparently make pit bulls look timid by comparison _ rather than
docile domestic ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   Katz suggests that the sport evolved out of the practice by
Yorkshire hunters of keeping their ferrets warm and dry in their
trousers on drizzly days. Others believe it is the outgrowth of a
medieval British law that banned working-class people from owning
animals that were so effective at poaching rabbits from the game
reserves of the nobility. Poachers apparently stuffed their ferrets
down their pants to conceal them from gamekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's story profiled 72-year-old Reg Mellor, the ``king of
ferret legging,'' who at the time held the world's record, a
scarcely believable five hours, 26 minutes. (He could have gone
longer, he said, but all the spectators went home and workmen began
to dismantle the stage.)
</P>
<P>
   The article has achieved a curiously enduring cult following;
people _ almost always men _ fax old copies to friends of friends.
It's been reprinted in both anthologies Outside Magazine has
issued. The second, ``Best of Outside: The First 20 Years,'' is
still in print.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Mellor took his life a couple of years after the article
appeared. Some of his neighbors in the town of Barnsley thought the
sudden onslaught of publicity unhinged him; others said he had to
have been mentally unbalanced to participate in the sport in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ferret-legging in Yorkshire pretty much
died out with Mellor. However, I have heard rumors that it survives
in a remote corner of County Kildare in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, cheese-rolling shows no sign of fading away. ``They
say they'll keep doing it every year, no matter what,'' Rosemary
Hellerman, owner of the nearby Haven Tea House, told me when I
passed through. ``I doubt you could ever have anything like that in
America, not with all those lawyers.''

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ For the first time in four
years, Israeli and Palestinian troops engaged in hours of gun
battles in the West Bank Monday as Israeli forces suppressed
Palestinian demonstrations by shooting tear gas, rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition into stone-throwing crowds. Three
Palestinians were killed _ two police officers and a teen-ager _
and 350 were injured, according to Palestinian officials. Six
Israeli soldiers were injured, according to Israeli officials.
Against this violent backdrop, Prime Minister Ehud Barak won
Parliament's approval to transfer full control of three Palestinian
villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority, although
three parties in his fractious coalition did not support him and
one quit the government. By Deborah Sontag.

   SCI-CO2-EMISSIONS (Undated) _ As the economic and political
difficulty of reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes ever more
obvious, a move is under way to manipulate the carbon cycle so that
it will remove more heat-trapping gases from the air. But the
ambitious idea is surrounded by questions of potential risks and
obstacles. Some researchers are looking for ways to remove carbon
from industrial emissions before they are released. But more
promising, many believe, are prospects for increasing the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by what is called the
terrestrial biosphere: the whole complex of living things on land,
mainly plants and various tiny inhabitants of the soil. The
expansion of these carbon reservoirs, or ``sinks,'' in vegetation

believes explains why nine of 10 people in all cultures are
right-handed, why left-handed parents are more likely to have
left-handed children and why identical twins often have different
handedness. Most people, he says, have a specific dominant gene
that makes them right-handed. But about 20 percent of people lack
the right-handed gene, and these people without the gene have a
50-50 possibility of being right-handed or left-handed. By David E.

   WASHINGTON _ This Sunday, Mother's Day, tens of thousands of
women will descend upon Washington to demand that Congress pass
``sensible gun laws'' to protect their children. It will be by far
the largest gun-control rally ever held. A central concern for many
on the ``Million Mom March'' is one extraordinary fact: every day,
according to the U.S. Justice Department, 13 children are killed by
guns in America. It is one of the most disturbing statistics in the
gun-control debate. The number is true. It is also misleading. &QL;

ONE SIDE EFFECT OF GENETIC TESTS: FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    Dr. Howard Markel is a fellow at the Center for Scholars and
Writers of the New York Public Library and an associate professor
of history and of pediatrics and communicable diseases at the
University of Michigan.
 By HOWARD MARKEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon, the human genome will be completely mapped allowing
doctors to detect, treat and prevent disease on a level
unimaginable a few decades ago. But while genetic screening tests
are remarkable diagnostic tools, they are not without potential
harm to those who happen to carry a deleterious trait. As a
physician who routinely orders such tests, I thought I long
understood this dynamic. But I needed my wife, Kate, for a more
definitive lesson.
</P>
<P>
   When Kate told me she was pregnant with our first child I was,
of course, elated. Soon enough, I began to worry about the
possibility of a less than perfectly healthy baby. Most expectant
parents nervously ponder this issue, but my work as a pediatrician
creates an especially skewed vision: Many of the children who
inhabit my world are among that tiny minority with the most serious
and often the rarest illnesses. In a strange sense, when
abnormality and disease dominate your view, it becomes ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of her obstetrician, Kate underwent a complete
battery of genetic tests but this only sharpened my fears. What if
one of us carried a deadly disease that might be passed on to our
unborn child? Such mental meanderings reminded me that like many
doctors, I absolutely hate the idea of my (or my loved ones') being
a patient.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, I came home to find Kate nervously hunched over a
cup of tea. Before I could even take off my coat, she told me that
she tested positive for the genetic screening test for Tay Sachs
Disease (TSD), a rare genetic disease that clusters among Ashkenazi
Jews, of Central and Eastern European descent. Coded by a recessive
gene, meaning that one can be a silent carrier, the actual disease
requires both parents to have the trait. Even then, there is only a
one out of four chance that their baby will receive both genes.
</P>
<P>
   TSD is a horrific malady resulting from the baby's inability to
produce one critical enzyme (beta-hexosamidinase A) necessary for
normal brain growth and development. First described in the 1880s
by a British ophthalmologist, Warren Tay, and a New York City
neurologist, Bernard Sachs _ each of whom had many immigrant
Ashkenazi Jews among their patients _ the disease is 100 percent
fatal. Although newborns with the disease appear normal, within
several months, they begin to exhibit severe muscular weakness _
pediatricians call them ``floppy babies'' _ and difficulty doing
the activities infants typically do: rolling over, crawling and
walking, feeding, swallowing and ultimately breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding these problems are blindness, seizures and a
generalized haze of unresponsiveness. Death comes all too
mercifully for TSD babies long before a healthy child is readied
for kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one in our families had been identified as a TSD
carrier, we most certainly fit the profile. Both of Ashkenazi
Jewish descent, our grandparents were close friends and members of
the same Yiddish social clubs, known as landsmanshaftn, that were
formed in America at the turn of century to help newcomers adjust
to a new life. Not only did Kate's grandfather Ben dance at our
wedding, 24 years before he danced at my bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this intertwined family history, however, the odds of
our both being carriers, let alone the baby's having TSD were low.
Only one in 35 Ashkenazi Jews carry the trait and, before genetic
screening became available in the 1970s, about one in 3,500 to
4,000 of their newborns suffered from TSD. Today, the incidence is
much lower since more than 95 percent of the pregnancies are
terminated when TSD is identified by prenatal screening.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning as I rolled up my sleeve for a blood test,
I told myself that I ``knew'' all about TSD. I had even written
several scholarly papers on the stigma of genetic screening tests.
Such intellectualization, however, offered little comfort and did
not allay my fears. To worsen matters, when I told Kate that I had
discussed her carrier status with some of my friends, she was
perturbed that I divulged this information without discussing it
with her first, revealing how little I really understood about the
sensitivities of those labeled a ``carrier'' of a devastating
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news finds you quickly, doctors like to advise their
patients, but you often have to wait for good news. Each night as I
walked home from work, I prayed that this child would pass this
first hurdle unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   I bargained with God on how I would be a model parent. I wept at
the possibility that I, too, was a carrier and the potential
options facing my wife and me. In a small sense, I felt the
anguish, the helplessness, and the uncertainty of a patient. I was
reminded of what a patient once told me when confronted with a
terrible diagnosis: before someone tells you that you or your loved
one is sick you may have a hundred problems. Afterward, you have
only one.
</P>
<P>
   A week later Kate called me at the office. From the tone of her
voice, I immediately knew it was good news. ``You're negative,
Howard,'' she exclaimed, ``the baby can't have Tay-Sachs.'' As I

We were particularly fortunate in that many genetic screening tests
do not provide such definitive ``yes'' or ``no'' answers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer tests, like the BRCA1 genetic test for breast
cancer, only indicate a higher risk of developing a specific
disease without any clear guarantees one way or the other, creating
a host of new problems of decision making for patients.

   Kate is now in her eighth month of pregnancy and there are still
more tests for our unborn child to pass _ not counting a lifetime
of tribulations that await her or him a few weeks hence. We'll have
to take each day as it comes _ which is, most likely, how the noble
term patient originated.

   (UNDATED) _ When Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992, he applauded
the ``German model,'' highlighting the intimate links between
banks, unions, corporations, and government. But after Clinton
moved into the White House, he soon learned that the German
economic model was falling apart, and that the U.S. economy was in
fact far healthier and sturdier than Germany's. Eight years later,
Germany may be getting its economic house back in order. Under the
left-wing government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, the German
economy should grow at least 3 percent in 2000. This is
Reaganomics, twenty years after Reagan, albeit with a Teutonic
tilt...By Todd G. Buchholz, Worth Magazine &QL;

AS JOHN PAUL NEARS 80, CHURCH WEIGHS QUESTION OF SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JEFF ISRAELY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images of frailty are unavoidable: the elderly pontiff
nodding off at a Mass in Bethlehem, stumbling and cutting his head
in Warsaw, relying on a cart with wheels to traverse St. Peter's
Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   The once vigorous man who slipped away from the Vatican for
skiing holidays now physically trembles and slurs his speech,
apparent side effects of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Pope John Paul II's physical weakness seems to have
endeared him to the public _ the photographs of the frail old man
praying alone before the Western Wall in Jerusalem, shuffling
painfully across the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial seemed to serve
as powerful images of spiritual intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But as John Paul approaches his 80th birthday on Thursday,
Catholics have quietly begun to consider the inevitable moment when
John Paul's death or, less likely, retirement will create an
opening for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is the world's most visible and influential religious
figure, considered by observant Catholics to be infallible when
speaking on faith and morals. Not only is he the spiritual leader
of the largest branch of Christianity _ there are an estimated 1
billion Catholics _ but he also commands unrivaled access to the
media and to world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has used his pulpit to speak out on a variety of
economic and social policies, from his lifelong fight against
communism to his ardent opposition to abortion and capital
punishment. The results have been mixed, but his moral suasion was
cited by the White House when explaining its support for
international debt relief and by the governor of Missouri when
commuting the death sentence for a triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The next leader of the world's Catholics will be chosen, as
virtually all popes have been, by an extremely select group of men:
Roman Catholic cardinals under the age of 80. Right now, there are
104 cardinal-electors, although that number could rise if John Paul
creates more cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals aren't talking _ Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston
did not return a call seeking comment _ and when the time comes,
they will deliberate behind closed doors inside the Sistine Chapel.
But others have begun to write and speak about the first papal
election of the church's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among journalists at the Vatican, talk of who will be the next
pope started around eight years ago,'' said Marco Tosatti, who for
the last 18 years has been the Vatican correspondent for La Stampa,
a Turin-based daily. ``I've seen so many candidates over the years,
cardinals who six years ago a lot of people would say this could
very likely be the next pope, who are now dead or forgotten or very
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals believe the pope is actually chosen by the Holy
Spirit, who moves through them to guide their voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the cardinals will be looking for a
characteristic and then trying to find the man to fit that,'' said
the Rev. Todd Lajiness, a Detroit native who now works inside the
Vatican. ``That's a political, or I guess you could even say,
democratic, outlook. That's good for government. The church is a
much different entity.''
</P>
<P>
   But most observers say the cardinals also weigh a number of
strategic and political considerations when they gather.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key factors to be weighed when considering the
candidates for pope: age, geography, ideology, diplomatic and
communication skills, and health.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and church officials interviewed in Italy and the
United States generally seemed to agree that the cardinals are
likely to be seeking a pope who is:
</P>
<P>
   --Old. Karol Wojtyla was just 58 when he became Pope John Paul
II, and as a result, his papacy has already lasted 21 years. A long
papacy tends to concentrate church power in Rome, and the cardinals
are expected to look for a pope in his 70s who probably would have
a shorter tenure and accumulate less power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as they like the present pope, there are problems when
a pope stays too long,'' said Richard P. McBrien, a Notre Dame
theologian and author of ``Lives of the Popes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of complaints about this pontificate
because it has tended to recentralize authority in the Vatican, and
there is a lot of resentment of the way they treat bishops like
altar boys. They'd like some breathing space after such a long and
dominating pontificate as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   --European. John Paul is the first Slavic pope, and the first
non-Italian since Hadrian VI died in 1523. The Italian cardinals, a
declining plurality in the College of Cardinals, are expected to
make a play to win the papacy back, and there are also strong
candidates from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals, having made a bold move in choosing a Pole in
1978, are thought likely to retreat to their comfort zo.e. There is
a long-shot chance that the cardinals would do something more
dramatic, choosing a pope from the Southern Hemisphere to
acknowledge that Africa and Latin America are rapidly becoming the
heart of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no chance the next pope will be an
American, because Americans are viewed as too liberal and too
powerful, and because the one American cardinal in recent years
widely judged to be electable, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin of
Chicago, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American has no chance,'' said Brian H. Smith, professor of
religion at Ripon College. ``The American church is looked upon as
too liberal, we have a very outspoken laity, and America represents
wealth and power in the wornd.''
</P>
<P>
   --Conservative, but less so than John Paul. The College of
Cardinals is a conservative group, dominated by appointees of John
Paul II. But scholars say the cardinals have historically tended to
oscillate between conservative and more moderate papacies, and
after such a long conservative papacy they may be looking for
someone more open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinals are probably going to look for somebody who is a
bit more liberal, in terms of his views about authority, than the
current pontiff,'' said Fitchburg (Mass.) State College President
Michael P. Riccards, the author of ``Vicars of Christ: Popes,
Power, and Politics in the Modern World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a historic type of occurrence, as the cardinals,
who are pretty sophisticated, realize the institution has gone as
far as it can in one direction and try to bring it back to an even
keel,'' Riccards said.
</P>
<P>
   --Media-savvy and diplomatic. John Paul is the most traveled
pope in history, having taken 91 international trips during his
papacy; as a former actor he has been praised for his use of the
media to communicate positive images of the church, and he has
successfully improved relations with other religions. These
characteristics, particularly in an Information Age in which popes
are sure to remain highly visible, seem certain to become permanent
requirements for future popes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few positions in the modern world that have the
kind of visibility and moral force to them that the papacy can
have, and I think John Paul II has utilized that,'' said the Rev.
Donald P. Senior, president of Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago. ``The travels of the pope, and his use of the media have
become ingredients of the modern papacy. You couldn't have somebody
who would ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   This pope has succeeded at communicating despite his
increasingly slurred speech. He kisses the earth on arriving in a
new place, meets with youth, and prays in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the age of communication, the pope must have the ability to
communicate, . . . but there are many styles of communication,''
said Pietro Scoppola, an Italian religious history professor.
``This pope uses communication of the symbolical. There are times
he speaks and we can't understand everything he's saying, but the
image of him and his sickness symbolizes the weakness in all
humanity, the mystery of creation.''

EMOTIONAL MALADY IS LINKED TO SMELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sense of smell, as Marcel Proust and his madeleine made
clear, is intimately tied to feeling and memory.
</P>
<P>
   So it is perhaps not surprising that in schizophrenia, an
illness that plays havoc with the emotional capacities of those who
suffer from it, the sense of smell is impaired.
</P>
<P>
   People with schizophrenia often display what psychiatrists
describe as a ``blunting'' of emotional response that makes it
difficult for them to relate to others. But they also, researchers
have found, show deficits in their ability to detect, identify and
remember odors.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study, appearing in this month's American Journal of
Psychiatry, suggests that these abnormalities in the sense of smell
have their root in abnormal brain structure.
</P>
<P>
   Using magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Bruce Turetsky, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania, and his colleagues examined the olfactory bulbs _
blueberry-sized organs that act as relay stations between the nose
and brain _ in 26 schizophrenic patients and 22 comparison
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbs of patients with schizophrenia, the researchers found,
were on average 23 percent smaller in volume than those of control
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy in size, said Turetsky, was large enough that it
was clearly visible on the MRI scans. The difference between the
groups persisted even after cigarette smoking, the use of
anti-psychotic medications, age and other factors that might
influence the size of the bulbs were taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   The study, said Dr. Robert Bilder, associate director for human
research at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging of the Nathan
Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., is,
he believes, the first to reveal, in schizophrenia, a structural
abnormality in more primitive brain areas, which are also involved
in emotional processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 10 or 20 years,'' Bilder said, schizophrenia
researchers have paid ``an enormous amount of attention to the
higher parts of the brain and the associated higher cognitive
functions. This kind of a study is important in moving the focus to
lower brain systems, that are crucial to the regulation of emotion
and visceral functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation of the relationship between olfaction and
schizophrenia, Turetsky said, may also help shed light on the
emotional disturbances that are characteristic of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell is so tightly linked to emotional processing,'' Turetsky
said. ``It's essentially impossible to present an olfactory
stimulus that doesn't have an emotional valence to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The olfactory system offers scientists a unique window on both
normal and abnormal brain functioning, in part because it is so
clearly laid out, with sensory impulses traveling from receptors in
the nose to the olfactory bulbs, where they are decoded, and then
to olfactory centers in higher brain regions.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in olfaction observed in schizophrenia, researchers
believe, may also contain clues to how the disease develops. Many
scientists suspect that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental
disorder, a result of hereditary predisposition and some
environmental insult, perhaps occurring during the early months of
fetal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the smaller size of the olfactory bulbs in schizophrenia
reflects abnormalities occurring early in development or stems from
a degenerative process later in life is still unknown, Turetsky
said. But, he pointed out, olfactory neurons, unlike those in other
areas of the brain, die and are replaced throughout life,
displaying a plasticity that makes the olfactory system relatively
resistant to degenerative disease.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of smell or abnormalities in odor identification or
detection is also seen in some degenerative diseases, like
Alzheimer's. The next task facing the researchers, said Dr. John Q.
Trojanowski, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at
Penn, is to show that the smaller volume of the olfactory bulbs is
specific to schizophrenia and is not found in other illnesses, like
manic depression, alcoholism or dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have been studying the brains of patients
with schizophrenia for a century or more, no one appears to have
ever noticed a difference in the size of the olfactory bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Trojanowski said, may be that early researchers saw
no particular reason to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how the bulbs sit in the skull when you take
out the brain, it's easy to leave them behind,'' Trojanowski said.

   --Healthy. The cardinals were shocked when Albino Luciani, who
in 1978 became Pope John Paul I, died after just 33 days in office.
The papacy is an increasingly taxing job, and the cardinals are
expected to demand a certain level of vigor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ciro Benedettini, a Vatican spokesman, said it would be
inappropriate to comment on the topic of papal succession while
there is still an active pope in the chair of St. Peter. But
experts in Italy and the United States interviewed for this story
generally agreed that the world's cardinals, in their own unique
way, are already politicking, trying to demonstrate to one another
their intellectual heft, knowledge of world affairs, and an ability
to communicate through public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates most often mentioned as possible successors
are Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria, the president of the
pontifical council for interreligious dialogue, and Cardinal Carlo
Maria Martini of Italy, the archbishop of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Arinze would be the first black pope in modern times; there is
some debate over the race of Gelasius I, an African who was pope
from 492 to 496. Although he is from Africa, he is also a Vatican
insider. He would be a powerful choice symbolically, not only
because he is black but also because he is from the southern
hemisphere, but at age 67, he may be too young.
</P>
<P>
   Martini would be the first Jesuit pope, making him a favorite of
many American Catholic intellectuals, and he is a highly regarded,
frequently published scholar of scripture and spirituality.
However, he is viewed as too liberal by some.
</P>
<P>
   Other oft-mentioned candidates include Cardinal Lucas Moreira
Neves of Brazil, another Vatican insider from the southern
hemisphere, but a man who is in ill health; Cardinal Dionigi
Tettamanzi of Genoa, who, at age 65, is considered young but is
popular among cardinals and considered a possible compromise
candidate, Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, a moderate who is prefect
of the Vatican's Congregation for Oriental Churches.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is possible the next pope is not even a cardinal yet
_ Giacomo della Chiesa had been a cardinal for just four months
when he was elected Pope Benedict XV in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to weigh what to look for from the next pope
without considering the strengths and weaknesses of the current
pope. Numerous scholars said John Paul II will be remembered for
his successes at outreach to other religions and to the farthest
geographic corners of the church, but also for his intolerance of
liberal thinking and dissent within the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the world he's been a marvelous pope, but for the church
his legacy is going to be more problematic, because there's a good
deal of division now within the Catholic community,'' said Thomas
Groome, a Boston College theologian. ``The cardinals are astute
observers of the mood of the church, and I don't think we're going
to get a right-wing ideologue. Their own love for the church and
the tradition would signal that we need somebody who can sweep a
broad swath of inclusion down the mainstream of Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, scholars say, the shortage of priests will
force a debate about priestly celibacy and the ordination of women,
although change on either front is unlikely soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of aspects to this pope's pontificate have to be
continued, such as outreach to other religions and other
Christians, concern about the Third World, and outreach to the
poor,'' McBrien said. ``But the more challenging things will be
internal: how to restore a greater sense of unity, raise the morale
of those committed to working for the church on a full-time basis .
. . and limit the powers of the Roman curia. The ancient title of
pontiff means supreme bridge maker, and the pope has to be someone
who tries to reach out to all sides.''

U.S. PRISON PRACTICES VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL TREATY ON TORTURE, U.N.
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Use of electric stun belts and restraint chairs, which
human rights groups allege are widely employed to restrain
prisoners in the United States, almost inevitably violates the
international treaty against torture, a U.N. monitoring group said
Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Committee Against Torture, which examines the
compliance of 118 countries that have ratified the 1984 pact, also
singled out police brutality, chain gangs, sexual assaults of
female prisoners by law enforcement officials and detention of
minors as problem areas in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee's panel of 10 human rights experts urged U.S.
officials to ``abolish electro-shock stun belts and restraint
chairs as methods of restraining those in custody,'' on grounds
their use ``almost invariably leads to breaches'' of the treaty,
which the United States ratified in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Clinton administration,
whose representatives received the recommendations without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stun belts, which are placed around a prisoner's waist, are
allegedly used in as many as 100 U.S. jurisdictions. The Clinton
administration's top human rights official, Harold H. Koh, argued
that no lawsuits had been brought that substantiate the accusations
of death or serious injuries to prisoners from such restraints. He
said such devices are used only to transport dangerous inmates,
although Amnesty International asserted that in at least one case,
a judge had ordered an electric shock be given to a prisoner during
a public court proceeding.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first review of the United States' record on torture and
other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the
committee also asked the U.S. government to ``ensure that minors
are not held in prison with the regular prison population.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The committee's conclusions, which took three pages to list,
came in response to last week's U.S. government report, which is
required for all countries that have ratified the U.N. Convention
Against Torture. The United States was nearly five years late
filing its report, a fact noted by the committee, which also asked
that the United States file its second report in November next
year. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Drawing on numerous examples provided by Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, the experts closely
questioned U.S. State and Justice Department officials last week
about practices that fall under the rubric of torture. The
committee has no independent investigative capacity so it must rely
on information provided by human rights advocates and, in countries
like the United States, uncensored media reports. The expert panel
also has no authority to sanction countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty argued there were numerous instances of mistreatment by
police and custody officials ``disproportionately directed at
racial and ethnic minorities.'' The U.S. report, which admitted
that the U.S. record was not perfect, listed well-known cases like
Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was beaten and sodomized
with a broomstick by New York City police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Committee experts concluded that ``the number of cases of police
ill-treatment of civilians, and ill-treatment in prisons'' were
matters of concern. This was particularly true, they said, because
``much of this ill-treatment by police and prison guards seems to
be based upon discrimination.''  &QL;

MAGICAL MEMORIES, MOM AND VAN CLIBURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Against the expanse of Van Cliburn's historic career, the
concert three years ago in San Antonio scarcely warrants a
footnote. Cliburn performed his signature piece that night,
Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, which drew the crowd to its
feet, a common response for one celebrated among the musical giants
of the 1900s. There were no medals awarded afterward. No large
spread noting the event in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, the concert lingers among a life's milestones. My
mother and I were in the audience, the first time either one of us
had heard Cliburn play in person. The experience largely defied
description, as mystical moments often do.
</P>
<P>
   I had known of Cliburn for several years by then. He was the boy
from East Texas who conquered the world with his talent in 1958,
winning the Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition in Moscow
at the height of the Cold War. I had seen photographs of his
ticker-tape parade in New York that resulted, and had heard of the
Cliburn celebrity that once rivaled that of Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   I first saw Cliburn in 1993, while covering the Fort Worth piano
competition that bears his name. He raced up and down the aisles
between performances, a lanky man always dressed in a navy suit and
tie, always among the most exuberantly appreciative members of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   We met once during that competition, and I shook one of his
famously large hands. A few years later, an ankle injury I suffered
playing basketball forced me to cancel a coveted sit-down interview
with Cliburn. He responded by sending me a huge bouquet of flowers.
Another writer, Mary Rogers, went instead, and in the lovely
profile that resulted, she wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends note that he is an old-fashioned man with a sense of
elegance, who doesn't own a pair of tennis shoes and dresses always
in a suit and tie, even as he practices his art in the small hours
of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, they say, sentimental, generous and kind, with a
childlike trust in people and a deep faith in God. They say he is
simple _ unaffected by his fame _ and almost always late ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He prays, writes poetry, walks late at night and is composing
a sonata. He doesn't dwell on life's disappointments, has no time
for jealousies or betrayals and believes in the fundamental
goodness of people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was _ and is _ a man with an aura. It was natural, then, to
wonder at the aura's source. Finally, that night in San Antonio, my
mother and I experienced it. Cliburn, in his sonorous speaking
voice, narrated Aaron Copland's tribute to Abraham Lincoln. Then
came the concerto itself, the same music with which he had tamed
Moscow four decades before. A roaring San Antonio crowd would not
let him leave, calling him back for several encores, adulation that
seemed to surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   Most other specifics escape me. I do remember how fast his hands
moved across the keyboard, how those long fingers could produce
such delicacy, how the short hairs stood on my neck. And I remember
the sense of being transported, of partaking of something timeless.
I wondered if others remembered those things, too.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, while a music student in Dallas, Lauren
Eberhart attended the finals of the Van Cliburn International Piano
Competition in Fort Worth, then a reception at Cliburn's mansion.
She has recollections of meeting him briefly that night, and of
seeing a piano in almost every room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty neat,'' Eberhart said when I called her last
week. ``It was like, `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   So that night in San Antonio, Eberhart awaited Cliburn's
performance with a mixture of excitement and curiosity. She had
taken a position playing trumpet with the San Antonio Symphony, and
thus would enjoy an intimate perspective of the legend's
performance. Some masters, she knew, did not always live up to
expectations when heard in the flesh. She wondered whether this
would be true of Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was wonderful,'' Eberhart said. ``He was just a
wonderful player with a lot of strength and a lot of control over
his instrument. He could really be strong on the piano, but pull a
beautiful sound out of it. You would see why he had the reputation.
And the audience absolutely loved him. They were on their feet in a
hall that was not acoustically friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberhart said she kept the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just realize that you're hearing something and someone who
has a significant place in musical history.''
</P>
<P>
   Violist Daniel Reinker was also a member of the San Antonio
Symphony that night. Many great soloists have passed through San
Antonio, he told me recently, but few of Cliburn's stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people who came to that performance who don't
often come to hear our orchestra,'' Reinker said. ``They came to
hear him. That in itself was thrilling to have all those new people
in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the sort of performer who has a musical personality that
just transcends the normal musical performance. It was really
magical, his presence and knowing that it was an opportunity that
would not present itself again. ... It was the only time I've
performed with him, and I imagine it will be the only time. That's
part of what makes it magical. You know you've got to cling to it
because it might be your only chance to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got goose bumps just thinking about it,'' my mother told
me in a recent telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   She was a young woman when Cliburn triumphed in Moscow, and
witnessed the fame that followed. My mother lived for most of her
life in a small town in northern Minnesota. I remember her taking
us to a concert of the Minnesota symphony when it passed through
our town, but hearing someone like Van Cliburn was unthinkable. So
sitting next to me in the San Antonio concert hall, she thought,
``Am I really here? Am I really doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Cliburn started to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was breathtaking,'' Mom said. ``It's hard to believe that
so much talent can be contained in one person, who can play so
beautifully and get the audience so enthralled. Hearing him play,
and watching his fingers fly over the keys ... I remember looking
around at the audience. He had everybody in the palm of his hand.
It was like everybody was under hypnosis. It was just crazy, how he
could get everybody right where he wanted them, or right where they
wanted to be, I guess you would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those surreal experiences,'' she said. ``He
just gathered everybody up. The audience kept calling him back. I
thought, `My goodness. That man must be tired because he puts his
whole heart and soul and body into his music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she put her finger on it, the source of the aura, that is.
Cliburn, a man of unearthly talent, who puts his whole heart and
soul and body into his music. It is good fortune indeed to have
witnessed that result firsthand.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ At the start of the 19th century, Freetown was
remote and malarial, but also a place of hope. This settlement for
destitute Africans from England and former slaves from the Americas
had become the main base in west Africa for enforcing the British
act that abolished the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 21st century, Freetown symbolizes failure
and despair.
</P>
<P>
   The capital of Sierra Leone may be less brutalized than some
other parts of the country, but its people are nonetheless
physically and psychologically scarred by years of warfare, and
this week they had to watch as foreign aid workers were pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' peacekeeping mission had degenerated into a
shambles, calling into question the outside world's readiness to
help end the fighting not just in Sierra Leone but in any of
Africa's many dreadful wars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since the difficulties of helping Sierra Leone seemed so
intractable, and since Sierra Leone seemed to epitomize so much of
the rest of Africa, it began to look as though the world might just
give up on the entire continent.
</P>
<P>
   It was in response to accusations of indifference towards Africa
that the U.N. Security Council, at America's behest, started this
year with a ``month of Africa.'' It went well. AIDS, refugees and
wars were all on the agenda, and there were signs that the new
concern was not just a 31-day wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, for instance, has since pressed
ahead with plans to combat AIDS, doubling its budgetary requests to
Congress. Congress, for its part, is backing a bill that will ease
or abolish trade restrictions for 48 African countries.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and other donors showed last month that they were
ready to intensify the fight against malaria, a disease that causes
misery in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And the United Nations has gone ahead with its peacekeeping
plans, sending 8,000 troops to Sierra Leone and pledging another
5,500, all being well, for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   All, however, is not well. Since January, Mozambique and
Madagascar have been deluged by floods, famine has started to
reappear in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe has succumbed to
government-sponsored thuggery, and poverty and pestilence continue
unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Most seriously, wars still rage from north to south and east to
west. No one can blame Africans for the weather, but most of the
continent's shortcomings owe less to acts of God than to acts of
man.
</P>
<P>
   These acts are not exclusively African _ brutality, despotism
and corruption exist everywhere _ but African societies, for
reasons buried in their cultures, seem especially susceptible to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone manifests all the continent's worst
characteristics. It is an extreme, but not untypical, example of a
state with all the epiphenomena and none of the institutions of
government.
</P>
<P>
   It has poverty and disease in abundance, and riches too: its
diamonds sustain the rebels who terrorize the place. It is unusual
only in its brutality: rape, cannibalism and amputation have been
common, with children often among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   For this it can thank, above all, Foday Sankoh, the rabel leader
brought into government in an ill-advised ``peace'' deal last July.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, Sierra Leone is of no great importance. If it makes
any demands on the world's attention, beyond the simple one of
sympathy for its people, it is as a symbol for Africa. Yet the
United Nations has sent troops to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh wants them out, so that he can plunder and torture at
will. He has therefore done his best to terrify them, and their
political masters, by capturing several hundred U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, meaning the great powers who can render it
useful or supine, is torn by all the usual arguments. It agonizes
that it cannot stand idly by, as it did in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it cannot, after all its fine words in January, turn
its back on Africa. But neither can it keep a peace that does not
exist, nor intervene in every war in every corner of the globe. It
must beware of mission creep, and fight only where it can win.
</P>
<P>
   African wars are, above all, matters for fellow Africans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is merit in each of these propositions, though some of
them are contradictory. Fortunately, not all. The proper course for
the Security Council now is to authorize troops to snatch Sankoh
and put him on trial, for recent crimes if not for the ones
committed before he was given an0amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations must be given enough troops, with enough
equipment, training and sophisticated leadership, to quell the
rebels. Realistically, that means that some of them must be
First-World soldiers, drawn at least initially from the British
force already there, with a mandate to fight.
</P>
<P>
   And once any fighting is finished, the United Nations must stay
on in Sierra Leone, as it is staying on in the Balkans, to wage
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it must win. It must do so, first, for the people of
Sierra Leone; second, for the people of Africa; and, third, for the
people of any country similarly threatened in the future, which is
another way of saying for its own credibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Somali warlord, Muhammad Aideed, sent the Americans scuttling
from Africa in 1993. If another thug can with impunity see off the
entire United Nations, the organization may as well go out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that it should also send troops to Congo: the
situation there is far more complex, and even more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United Nations, whose recent history is littered with
meaningless vows of protection in ``safe'' areas, is forced by the
parsimony or fears of its First-World members to cut and run in
Sierra Leone, warlords everywhere will take it as a license to act
at will.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa especially, nothing would do more to justify despair. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The West should not fear a strong, prosperous, even
militarily competent Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin's rousing appeal to old-fashioned national pride
at the grand Kremlin ceremony on May 7 in which he was inaugurated
president was not in itself malign.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that Russians of all stripes should wish to
regain some of the self-respect they have lost in such quantities
since the Soviet empire shattered a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable, too, after the disappointment of the
feeble and wayward Boris Yeltsin, that the new president's youthful
and disciplined manner, and his plain intention to restore his
country to its place in the world, should raise many a Russian
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should it necessarily worry non-Russians. A self-assured,
rich Russia should be less difficult than a bitter, prickly, poor
one, still armed with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The West should wish Putin's presidency well. Moreover, the new
man in the Kremlin says many of the right things. Russia, he
correctly insists, needs a proper legal framework for undertaking
the sort of economic reforms that could eventually bring it justice
and equity as well as material prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeated his intention to reform taxes, to deregulate
business, to secure protection for investors' rights, and to reform
the landholding system so that individuals can own farms and
develop property.
</P>
<P>
   He has inducted some genuine reformers into his team. He has
rallied Russia's entrepreneurs, small businessmen as well as
magnates, to his flag. Most importantly, he has declared that the
day of the ``oligarchs,'' the tycoons who have been pulling many of
the country's political strings, is over.
</P>
<P>
   All that is good. It may not even be bad that Putin should be
consolidating power.
</P>
<P>
   He has forged an impressive understanding with the lower house
of parliament, the Duma, so that virtually all the parties in it,
including the diehard Communists at one end of the spectrum and the
economic liberals at the other, sound keen to give him a chance.
</P>
<P>
   He has already persuaded several foreign leaders that, as the
well-worn phrase goes, he is a man with whom they can do business.
</P>
<P>
   And on some issues he has actually delivered the goods: he has
persuaded the Duma, for instance, after years of stalling, to
ratify not just Start-2, the treaty to limit long-range missiles,
but also the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the doubts about Putin also linger, even mount. One is
whether his pledge to see off the oligarchs should be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing prominent criminals to justice would send a powerful
message, not just to Russians but to foreigners too, that the new
administration in Russia believes in the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Putin has done nothing that visibly distances
him from Yeltsin's establishment. He may perhaps be steeling
himself to take on one or other of the tycoons, but it seems more
likely that he is trying to play them off against each other.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment of Mikhail Kasyanov as prime minister is far
from reassuring. Kasyanov may be clever and tough, but nothing in
his past suggests that he is likely to be a scourge of the
oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made a friendly overture to the Poles, ever suspicious
of Russia, but his lieutenants have at the same time been making
nasty noises towards other neighbors, including the Balts, whose
recently restored independence from Russia is fragile.
</P>
<P>
   And the new president shows little readiness to come to terms
with the rebellious Chechens, still reeling from Putin's brutal war
against them.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing still are the signs that Putin, a former KGB
spy, holds civil rights in contempt, believing that an iron hand is
required to bring order to the country and that it should not be
unduly fettered by democratic constraints.
</P>
<P>
   He may, it is said, want to use the KGB's domestic successor to
deter political dissent and to undermine his legitimate opponents.
Some journalists say they and their employers are already being
bullied to get into line.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may also seek to curb the powers of the regional
governors, some of whom, it is true, have abused their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is early days. Putin has a stock of goodwill, both
within Russia and abroad. He seems intelligent. Some of the best as
well as the worst of the new Russians appear to have his ear.
</P>
<P>
   He will not gain the confidence of westerners, however, until he
shows that he is his own man, and that that man is someone who
believes in civil liberty and the rule of law, not just in the
strength of despots. &QL;

POWERFUL NEW PEARL JAM ALBUM OUT TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Pearl Jam song ``Rival'' opens with the menacing sounds
of a growling dog. ``Thin Air'' drips melancholy like a Roy Orbison
tear-jerker. And ``Breakerfall'' rages with the anguish and
desperation of an empty heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a girl on a ledge, she's got nowhere to turn/ 'Cause
all the love that she had was just wood that she burned,'' Eddie
Vedder sings in the angry, searing rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam's new album, ``Binaural,'' is due in stores Tuesday on
Epic Records. Powerful and atmospheric, it reflects the Seattle
band's collaboration with producer, engineer and musician Tchad
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The album, the band's sixth, comes out at a time when Pearl Jam
is in a good space, guitarist Stone Gossard said in a phone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's going fine. We've having a lot of fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The band is about to hit the road. It will begin a 27-date
European tour May 23 in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by a U.S. tour
beginning Aug. 3 in Virginia Beach, Va. Pearl Jam performed warmup
shows last week in Bellingham and Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pearl Jam feuded with Ticketmaster in the mid-'90s over
ticket service charges, the band will sell most of the tickets
through Ticketmaster and the remainder through local, independent
agents.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour gets under way, Pearl Jam will celebrate its 10th
anniversary as a band. The group's first album, ``Ten,'' catapulted
the band to international fame in the early '90s, a time when
grunge turned Seattle into a rock mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real milestone,'' Gossard said. ``And when we start
this tour, we will have had the same drummer for two tours in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron is the latest in a
string of Pearl Jam drummers, including Jack Irons, Dave Abbruzzese
and Dave Krusen. Cameron _ whose wife, April Cameron, played viola
on the new album _ replaced Irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt has been making records with us and touring with us, but
I don't know whether he's officially a member or not,'' Gossard
said. ``It's always been a little vague to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wife and a family and he's got his own musical
projects that he puts a lot of energy into. Those are all big
priorities in his life. But as long as he wants to play with us,
we'd love to have him. He's such a great musician and a great
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossard gave credit to producer Blake for the new album's
unusual title and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has worked with Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt
and Elvis Costello, is a member of Latin Playboys, the Los Lobos
side band featuring David Hidalgo, Louie Perez and Mitchell Froom.
The Playboys' 1999 album, ``Dose,'' is intense and surreal,
embellished with hi- and lo-fi sound effects and experimental
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sonics of his records and the atmosphere he creates are
pretty unique,''Gossard said. ``Tchad mixed a lot of songs on Tom
Waits' `Bone Machine.' Some of it was really industrial sounding,
but organic at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patient and creative, Blake was an asset in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who loves working on stuff because he
likes the way it sounds and not because he thinks it's going to be
a hit,'' he said. ``He's just very in tune with trying to be
creative in the studio and being patient with that process. He's a
great engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album got its title from the binaural microphone that
Blake brought into the studio. Normally used in acoustic laboratory
environments for testing and studying the nuances of human hearing,
the binaural mike resembles a plastic human head with microphones
where the ears would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a binaural mike, you basically set it out there in front
of you and it's a stereo recording device that simulates what
things would sound like in your head,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked up the word `binaural,' it meant to listen with
both ears. So it seemed like a fitting title for the album.''
</P>
<P>
   The binaural microphone is what gives the song ``Soon Forget''
its razor-sharp presence. Vedder, who wrote the song, accompanies
himself on ukelele on the tender, humorous track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette,'' Vedder
sings. ``Thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic.
... He's living a day he'll soon forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful little song, sentimental and fun at the same
time,'' Gossard said. ``I think it was something that everyone in
the band immediately responded to. As soon as we heard him play it,
we were like, `Oh, that's gotta go on the record.' I think Ed was
just joking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Recorded at Gossard's Studio Litho in Seattle, ``Binaural'' took
about eight months to write and record. It features music and
lyrics by Pearl Jam core members Gossard, Vedder, bassist Mike
McCready and bassist Jeff Ament, as well as drummer Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked over a longer period of time than we normally do,
but we weren't super-rigorous about it,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd work for a couple of weeks, then take a month or two off,
then come back and work for a couple more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossard wrote the music and lyrics for three songs, ``Rival,''
``Thin Air'' and ``Of the Girl,'' a sweet, simple love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work all different ways,'' Gossard said of his songwriting.
``You have a riff and you just start playing it and then you start
humming something and you start filling in words. That's how I do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever that mood is, you try to explore it and try to be as
unself-conscious about it as you can possibly be. Sometimes that
means singing the same riff for weeks and weeks until all of a
sudden the right words pop into your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivals'' (which opens with the growling of Blake's dog,
Dakota) is a vengeful, ominous song that begins with the words,
``All my rivals will see what I have in store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came up with the riff and we played with that for a
while,'' Gossard said. ``I kind of saw it as a cartoon exploration
of competition and paranoia and people's perspective on who's out
to get them. I thought of relating that to how nations deal with
each other and sort of push each other around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then while we were working on the album the whole
Columbine High School tragedy happened and it started reflecting
some of that stuff, too. So it just kind of has a weird mishmash of
influences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Binaural'' follows the release of last year's ``Live on Two
Legs'' and 1998's ``Yield.'' The single ``Nothing As It Seems'' was
released in April and is at No. 4 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock
chart.
</P>
<P>
   The original May 23 release date for ``Binaural'' _ the CD cover
features a Hubbell Telescope color photo of the Hourglass Nebula
encircling a dying star 8,000 light years from Earth _ was moved up
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, if you have the record done and it's
ready to get out, you might as well put it out as soon as
possible,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the advance copies go out, people will start to get
the record and if it ends up online, there may be a situation where
people are getting it before it goes on sale.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ So Tony Blair already thinks he knows why the New
Labour did so badly in the local elections on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   All his adult life, the British prime minister asserted in an
unrepentant speech five days later, he has been struggling to
represent ``a politics that does not fit neatly into traditional
categories of left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   This new approach, he says, confuses traditional voters, who
make the mistake of thinking: ``Yes, you may be competent but you
believe in nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's counter is that he does believe _ with a passion _ in
his new sort of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither new right nor old left, he denies that there is a need
to choose either failed religion, and promises to continue his
mission of ``modernizing'' Britain no matter how much his own party
may clamor to return to the true old faith.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, this restatement of the Blairite creed is both
admirable and maddening. It is, for a start, maddeningly
self-righteous.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister who keeps telling voters that his new ideas
have far outstripped their old thinking should not be surprised
when they take him down a peg, as Londoners have just done by
voting in Ken Livingstone, the man Blair forced out of the Labour
Party on the grounds that he would be a ``disaster'' as their new
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's creed is also maddeningly vague. If he has really torn
up the old map to strike out in some bold new direction he needs to
give a plainer sense of it than can be gleaned from the slogans
about modernization and waffle about the ``third way.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is there to admire? Mainly deeds, not words: an
independent Bank of England; competent economic management; the
expulsion of most hereditary peers from the House of Lords;
devolution; constructive engagement instead of guerrilla war with
the European Union; pressures to get more out of teachers and other
public workers; incentives to get young people from welfare into
work; a shift of money from universities (where students must now
pay their way) towards vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the execution of policy has been flawed. For
example, Labour might have escaped its humiliation in London if
Blair had not tried so transparently to cling on via his party to
the power he claimed to be surrendering to a mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But the record after three years is not bad. So far, Blair has
managed both to do useful things and to refrain from doing too many
foolish ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though no Thatcherite _ she would never have burdened firms with
the EU's social chapter or a minimum wage _ he has not slid back
into Old Labour ways.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Blair is to be admired for refusing so far to take
fright after last week's elections. Governments seldom fare well in
midterm local elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the results on May 4 went beyond the usual slap on the
wrist. The Tories gained 16 local councils while Labour lost 15.
Londoners did not just make Livingstone their mayor but also pushed
the official Labour candidate into third place and gave the Tories
most votes for the London assembly.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much consolation in the thought that London was an
own-goal: it was a humiliation all the same, and the own-goal
cannot explain last week's other losses.
</P>
<P>
   Labour has lost recent elections in Scotland, and was defeated
in last year's elections for the European Parliament. It performed
dismally in the election for the new Welsh assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally there were special factors on each occasion. But on
each occasion, many traditional Labour voters also chose to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Nobody can accuse Blair of not trying to imbue his new
politics with missionary zeal. He sermonizes at the drop of a hat.
But after last week's elections there is no longer much doubt about
what ails his party.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the ``third way,'' it does not turn on
Labour's heartlands like the old-time religion used to. Hence the
increasingly frantic calls on him to tack left and woo back the
``heartland'' voters.
</P>
<P>
   Why not bump up all state pensions, regardless whether the
beneficiaries are rich or poor? Why partially privatize the
air-traffic control system just when venting some anti-business
prejudice might work wonders in the demoralized heartlands?
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing the least surprising about this turn of events.
Two groups of voters acted in concert to give Blair his landslide
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One consisted of traditional Labour supporters who hoped that
once in office Blair would drop his New Labour pretensions and get
on with the familiar job of doling out the spoils.
</P>
<P>
   The other consisted of former Conservative voters, fed up with
John Major, who saw Blair as a more competent and interesting
species of compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later it is clear that the second group was right,
and that the first resents Blair's choice of their party as his
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps his nerve and remains deaf to the pleas for a left
turn, the same improbable coalition may very well carry him through
another general election.
</P>
<P>
   A Tory victory in a general election still seems wildly
implausible. And if it were to become more likely, Labour's core
voters might be galvanized to get out and vote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, and to his credit, Blair has explicitly refused to turn
to the left. But if he was ever to waver, that is when the danger
would begin. &QL;

MILLION MOM MARCH: ANNIE, GET YOUR GUN CONTROL

Times Syndicate is for use by clients of The Economist.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This Sunday, Mother's Day, tens of thousands of
women will descend upon Washington to demand that Congress pass
``sensible gun laws'' to protect their children.
</P>
<P>
   (A smaller number of self-described ``pistol-packin' mommas''
will counter-demonstrate against new gun laws, sensible or
otherwise.)
</P>
<P>
   To a city sated with political exhibitions, this ``Million Mom
March'' may seem just another in a long line of public displays.
Looked at another way, though, it is unusual: it is by far the
largest gun-control rally ever held.
</P>
<P>
   A central concern for many on the march is one extraordinary
fact: every day, according to the Justice Department, 13 children
are killed by guns in America.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most disturbing (and oft-cited) statistics in
the gun-control debate. The number is true. It is also misleading.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report in the American Journal of Public Health found
that 22 million children live in houses with guns _ and that in 43
percent of those houses, the guns are not locked away or fitted
with trigger locks (indeed in 9 percent of them, the guns are also
kept loaded).
</P>
<P>
   Worries about the accidental deaths of children are regularly
used to justify mandating child-safety locks or having laws
requiring the safe storage of guns. Yet 85 percent of the deaths in
the study were not of small children at home: they were of
teenagers between 15 and 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Most were killed in gang conflicts, often over drugs.
Child-safety locks may or may not be a good idea. But they would do
nothing to stop such killings.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children under five who were killed in gun
accidents in 1997 was 20 (or half the number who drowned in
five-gallon plastic buckets). For children aged 14 and under, the
figure was 142.
</P>
<P>
   So are the opponents of gun control right to cast doubt on the
usefulness of trigger locks or gun-storage laws? Not necessarily,
because even that last number is still nine times higher than 25
other industrialized countries combined.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, teenagers in America are 11 times more likely than
those in other countries to shoot themselves using a gun.
</P>
<P>
   So laws that stop troubled adolescents from getting hold of
loaded weapons must surely do some good.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says John Lott, a professor at the Yale Law School. He
told National Journal, a Washington magazine, that ``I could not
find a relationship between safe-storage laws and total accidental
gun deaths or suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he suggested, is that accidental gun deaths occur in
the ``not-so-law-abiding segments of society.'' These ignore gun
laws anyway, however strict.
</P>
<P>
   A good example was the notorious recent killing of one
six-year-old by another: the culprit took the weapon from his
uncle, who lived in a crack house and had a raft of arrest warrants
out against his name.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is an exception to Lott's rule that gun-storage laws
are pointless: Florida, the first state to adopt such a law, has
seen a big drop in accidental gunshot deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation may be not that it simply passed the law
(otherwise other states would have seen similar falls, too). It is
that Florida has made the biggest fuss, with stiff punishments and
high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   And if that is so, then the million moms may be justified in
their march. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting in their front row pews, Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton visibly squirmed. They were failing to join in the
thunderous applause filling St. Patrick's Cathedral in support of
the view that ``the church must always be unambiguously pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Their discomfort was entirely fitting. Cardinal John O'Connor,
whose funeral they were attending, was forever putting politicians
on the spot with his robust public expression of traditional
Catholic views on abortion, homosexual practices and the ordination
of women (against), and trade unions and the homeless (supportive).
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was, as he wished to be remembered, a good priest, not
just a turbulent one.
</P>
<P>
   By forming healthy friendships with many of the people he
publicly disagreed with, he transcended his office as New York's
top Catholic and became a figure who will be much missed by people
of all faiths and none.
</P>
<P>
   He had clout in the wider world, too, which may be why mourners
at the funeral on May 8 included America's previous, current and
next presidents.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement has a tough act to follow. O'Connor, who became
Archbishop of New York in 1984, achieved early notoriety by talking
of excommunicating Geraldine Ferraro, a Democratic candidate for
vice president, because of her pro-choice statements. The two later
became friends.
</P>
<P>
   He made similar noises about another prominent pro-choice
Catholic New Yorker, Mario Cuomo, when Cuomo was governor.
</P>
<P>
   He fought with Ed Koch over the mayor's order banning
discrimination against gays by employers, including the church. Yet
the two men later co-authored a book, ``His Eminence and
Hizzoner,'' and comforted each other during their illjesses.
</P>
<P>
   The growing friendship with Koch ran parallel with better
relations with New York's other Jews. Despite offending some Jewish
groups early on by describing America's many abortions as
``precisely the same'' as the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews, he
made it clear that anti-Semitism was unacceptable for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   He required Catholic schools to teach about the Holocaust, and
blamed the crucifixion on the Romans rather than the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Although he called for a Palestinian homeland, American Jews
later praised him for his role in the Vatican's rapprochement with
Israel. He fared less well with homosexual groups, though he earned
respect for his work with AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when George W. Bush decided to express remorse for
failing to condemn anti-Catholic intolerance during his speech to
the fundamentalist Protestant Bob Jones University, he wrote to
O'Connor as the de facto leader of the Catholic church in America.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a position his successor will inherit automatically,
though if he shares O'Connor's mastery of the press in the
country's news capital he could quickly take it.
</P>
<P>
   What he will inherit for certain is a church with plenty of
problems. Despite its reputation as the global capital of Mammon,
and despite its image in much of America as a modern Sodom and
Gomorrah, New York remains a remarkably religious city.
</P>
<P>
   Its many churches and synagogues do a brisk trade each weekend.
On Ash Wednesday, New York City's streets fill with smartly-dressed
professionals proudly sporting charcoal crosses on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   It is not career-threatening for two of the country's hottest
young actors to star in a sincere, affectionate (and, to British
eyes, excruciating) movie-comedy, ``Keeping the Faith,'' in which a
trendy young rabbi and priest in New York end up affirming the
principle of priestly celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   But finding real-life priests who are willing to be celibate,
let alone trendy, is another matter. As in much of the rich world,
New York's priests are dying off much more quickly than they are
being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop will face tough choices about how best to use
his shrinking troops. The diocese has huge existing commitments and
is in financial trouble, but it also wants to expand its influence
in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's unique personality slowed the decline in influence of
New York's Catholics. That decline may now accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop will not play the central role in city life
that some of his predecessors did (such as Cardinal Spellman,
archbishop from 1939 to 1967, who became known as ``The
Powerhouse'' because of his political muscle).
</P>
<P>
   And he will lead a flock of 2.6 million that gets less
homogeneous by the day.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor came from the same conservative theological school as
the pope _ as does the man named to succeed him, Edward Egan, the
Bishop of Bridgeport, Conn. But New York's Catholics, while
admiring the pope and O'Connor, mostly ignore their teaching on
contraception, and many would like a softer attitude to gays and
women priests.
</P>
<P>
   Some, notwithstanding the ovation in St. Patrick's last Monday,
would even like a softer line on abortion. Enough of a common
mind-set remains that when Rudolph Giuliani (another pro-choice
Catholic politician) last year denounced a painting of the Virgin
incorporating elephant dung, his approval rating jumped from 60
percent to 80 percent among white Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   This may be crucial in his battle with Hillary Clinton for a
Senate seat _ assuming that his multiple recent troubles have not
derailed him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a fast-growing number of New York's Catholics
are not white. Rumor has it that one of the main tasks set by the
Vatican for the new archbishop will be to prepare his flock for a
Latino successor. New York's powerful Irish Catholics are unlikely
to give up what they regard as a sinecure without a fierce
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, the new archbishop will inherit O'Connor's well of
good humor. He may need it. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ If you have ever watched a glacier being deployed to
fight a house fire, you will have some idea of the speed of the
cleanup that has been going on, for the past 15 years, at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford is generally held to be the most dangerously polluted
spot in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, finally losing
patience, has fired the contractor in charge of the most delicate
task at Hanford: stabilizing highly radioactive liquid wastes
stored in 177 rapidly decaying concrete tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor was BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear
Fuels, which is already in a load of trouble at home.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL had recently announced that the expected cost for its
20-year contract to turn wastes from the tanks into glass logs
would more than double, to $15.2 billion, from the $6.9 billion the
company had estimated in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's decision also came on the heels of considerable
turmoil within the company, mncluding the resignation in April of
its Hanford manager, Mike Lawrence, who complained he was a
``figurehead'' and was being kept in the dark about BNFL's plans
for the site.
</P>
<P>
   So billions have been spent, and not one gallon of the estimated
54 million gallons of waste has been rendered harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hanford-watchers are not particularly sorry. Many of them
had opposed BNFL's much-vaunted plan to ``privatize'' the cleanup
by procuring financing from commercial markets and charging the
government only when stabilized wastes were produced.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the plan was wildly expensive and was privatized in
name only, with the federal government still liable for financial
problems or the contractor's default.
</P>
<P>
   When BNFL was sacked, ``we were thrilled with the decision,''
says Dana Gold, a lawyer with the Government Accountability
Project, a Seattle-based organization that has kept an eye on the
Hanford work for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In Gold's estimation, Richardson's action suggests a growing
sense of urgency about Hanford. If so, that would be a startling
change.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Hanford reservation was set up, in 1943, to
produce plutonium for America's nuclear arsenal, engineers profited
from the site's remoteness to cut plenty of corners.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, they began storing nuclear waste in underground
concrete tanks, most of which were built with only a single wall.
The tanks were seen as a temporary solution; surely, the engineers
thought, someone would soon devise a way to manage radioactive
materials.
</P>
<P>
   But no fix came, and by now 69 of the 177 tanks are leaching
their poisons into the ground only three miles from the Columbia
River, which irrigates 1 million acres and provides a home for
salmon runs that give jobs to fishermen all the way to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Plutonium production at Hanford stopped in the mid-1980s. At the
time, this threatened to destroy the economies of the nearby cities
_ Pasco, Kennewick and Richland _ that housed the thousands of
engineers who operated the reactors and plutonium refineries.
</P>
<P>
   But soon a lucrative line of work emerged: cleaning up. After
most of the 1990s had been frittered away, along with billions of
dollars, BNFL assumed control of the storage-tank cleanup in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was hired for its supposed expertise in ``glassifying''
nuclear waste, a technique by which the waste is dried, combined
with molten glass and then poured into steel jackets. Glassifying
waste is apt to fail, however, when it is tried with a brew as
volatile as the one in Hanford's tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and the Department of Energy must now find a new
contractor while extricating the federal government from its
contractual obligations to BNFL, which may cost millions.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Pollet, the director of a Hanford watchdog group and a
longtime critic of the Hanford work, fears that Congress sill be so
disgusted by the BNFL debacle that it will withhold funding for a
new contractor for a year, delaying the work even more.
</P>
<P>
   Even on its rosiest assumptions, BNFL intended to process no
more than 10 percent of the worst waste by 2018. Pollet hopes a new
contractor can improve on that schedule, but he is not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repent at leisure,'' read a 1992 headline in The Economist on
the Hanford cleanup. Today, even a leisurely pace would be a
welcome improvement. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's economy has been roaring along, with low
inflation, for so long now that any mention of speed limits and
overheating was becoming decidedly unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In recent weeks, the signs that the economy is being
stretched beyond its limits have become unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Every measure of inflation has ticked up, particularly consumer
prices. Labor costs are accelerating. And productivity growth, the
elixir of the new economy, has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve's next policymaking
meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Will Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues raise interest rates by half a percentage point,
abandoning their current strategy of gradually tightening monetary
policy in quarter-point increments? Most economists reckon that
they will.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, however, is more fundamental. Is the
extraordinary American expansion of the 1990s at risk of ending in
the good old-fashioned way, with spiralling inflation forcing a
hard landing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question depends on three more questions. How
strong is today's inflationary pressure, and how quickly is it
likely to intensify? And will the economy slow down fast enough to
dampen price pressure without tipping into recession?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for inflationary pressure is now unambiguous.
Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in the year to March. Even
excluding the volatile categories of oil and food, ``core''
consumer prices rose 2.4 percent, roughly one half of a percentage
point faster than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The GDP price deflator rose by 2.7 percent in the first three
months of 2000, up from 1.2 percent in the middle quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of March's nasty inflation surprise might be
``one-offs'': tobacco prices, for instance, were affected by a tax
increase in New York state. Nonetheless _ and modest as they may be
_ there are broad-based upward trends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, prices of services _ from health care
to hotel rooms _ have risen at an annualized rate of 3.6 percent,
almost a percentage point faster than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   More important for longer-term price pressure, labor costs are
also rising. The employment-cost index, perhaps the most widely
watched gauge of wage pressure, rose 4.3 percent in the year to
March, its biggest jump for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages and higher benefit costs both fuelled the increase.
</P>
<P>
   For workers in private industry, wages and salaries rose 4.2
percent in the year to March, while overall benefit costs were up
5.5 percent over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits, in particular, have risen sharply. In another
recent report, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve noted that
health-care costs in Minnesota were up 10-12 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The downward nudge that low benefit costs gave to wage figures
seems to be over. That America's super-stretched labor market is
finally producing accelerating wages is hardly a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April, the lowest
level since 1970 and the lowest peacetime level since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a brave economist who actually puts a number on
where the ``natural'' rate of unemployment might be today, it is
almost certainly higher than 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the tight labor market show any signs of letting up.
Part of the jump in employment was caused by the temporary hiring
of hundreds of workers for the U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   But even excluding that, over 256,000 new jobs, on average, have
been created every month for the past six months. That is
substantially more than the already strong monthly average of
230,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 65 percent of Americans aged 16 and over are now
employed, a record high. And every measure of joblessness is at
record lows: unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics, for
instance, have hit their lowest level since records began.
</P>
<P>
   With a labor market this tight, wage pressure is likely to keep
building up. It may do so gradually, but it will be persistent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To what extent higher wage pressure will fuel inflation depends
on productivity growth. In the second half of 1999, productivity
grew so fast that it more than made up for rising wages. Unit labor
costs actually fell.
</P>
<P>
   Recent evidence suggests that this trend may be reversing.
American workers' output per hour rose by an annualized 2.4 percent
in the first three months of 2000, well below the 6.9 percent rate
of productivity growth in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, unit labor costs rose 1.8 percent in the first
three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is still a modest rise, well below the rate of
inflation. Compared with a year ago, unit labor costs have risen a
tiny 0.7 percent. And it is important not to exaggerate the impact
of one quarter's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it seems that productivity growth is slowing while
employment costs are accelerating. Economists at Goldman Sachs
expect unit labor costs to accelerate to 3.2 percent by the end of
the year. At those levels, more inflationary pressure will be
inevitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of a wage-price spiral, the labor market
needs to calm down. And in order for unemployment to rise a bit,
the economy clearly needs to cool off: not just to its sustainable
rate of growth, but quite possibly below that for a while.
</P>
<P>
   For only if the economy grows below trend will unemployment
begin to edge up again.
</P>
<P>
   Again, accelerating productivity means that no one knows exactly
where America's sustainable growth rate now lies. But it is
certainly below the annualized 7.3 percent by which the economy
grew during the last three months of 1999, and below the 5.4
percent it grew in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible (but still highly uncertain) guess is that
America's sustainable rate of growth now lies between 3.5 percent
and 4 percent. Can the economy slow to that level, and beyond,
without a hard landing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 350 WORDS _ FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,025 OR CONTINUE TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, it is hard to see much evidence of serious slowdown. In
many ways, the first quarter's GDP estimates understate just how
much demand has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   A huge trade deficit and drops in inventory dragged down overall
GDP growth, even though overall consumption grew by a staggering
8.3 percent at an annual rate, and investment in equipment and
software soared almost 24 percent, as companies stopped worrying
about Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   This rip-roaring rate is unlikely to continue. The post-Y2K
effect will not recur. And much of the consumption boom was
probably due to the exceptionally mild winter, which may have
induced people to spend more than they might normally have done.
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics are still strong: April sales of new houses were
firmer than expected. But retail sales unexpectedly fell in the
same month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given that exports are likely to rise in today's
more vibrant global economy, and that inventories will need to be
built up, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2000 could still be
well over 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a sustained slowdown, interest rates clearly need to
rise. But by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets have priced in a high probability of
short-term rates rising a full percentage point, to 7 percent, this
year. Some analysts expect an even more aggressive tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at J.P. Morgan, for instance, now forecast that the
federal funds rate will reach 7.25 percent by August, which implies
a total rise of 1.25 percent in only four months.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rapid tightening may well not happen, but it is not
unprecedented. In 1994, Greenspan raised short-term interest rates
by 1.5 percent in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   Quite plausibly, rates could rise enough to slow down the
economy sufficiently without bringing on a calamity. But once a
boiler has started steaming, it is certainly hard to carry on
boosting it without blowing it up. &QL;

   NEW YORK AND LITTLE ROCK _ She can't win. In New York, Hillary
Rodham Clinton is widely seen as an Arkansas carpetbagger, and is
hated for it. In Arkansas, however, she is seen as a New Yorker,
and is hated for that just as keenly.
</P>
<P>
   How deeply does the hatred go? Much more deeply than seems
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, retailers report a brisk trade in nine-inch Hillary
voodoo dolls that carry the invitation to ``stick it to her.''
Doormats bearing her likeness are also selling fast.
</P>
<P>
   The latest book attacking her, Peggy Noonan's ``The Case Against
Hillary Clinton,'' sits near the top of the New York Times
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   A daylong symposium on Hillary last month at the American
Enterprise Institute began with Christopher Hitchens, a left-wing
journalist, calling Mrs. Clinton a ``lachrymose professional
liar,'' and concluded with David Horowitz, a conservative, warning
his listeners that the first lady is a messianic socialist.
</P>
<P>
   The spectre of ``Senator Clinton,'' trumpeted through Web sites
such as HillaryNo.com, has helped Rudy Giuliani, her assumed rival,
to haul in an unprecedented $19 million in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He raised $30,000 of that, audaciously, on a one-day visit to
Little Rock, Ark., last summer. But it was a canny move on his
part, since if New York is one pole in the hate-Hillary axis,
Little Rock is undoubtedly the other.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Hillary was there again, hoping to raise money for her
New York race. She had not been to Little Rock for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, dressed just like a chic New Yorker in a luminous aqua
trouser suit, with perfectly coiffed hair, Mrs. Clinton told her
listeners how fondly she looked back on her days as the Arkansas
governor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Some found that hard to believe. Arkansans always believed that
Mrs. Clinton, who was actually born in Illinois, thought herself
too good for a poor and rural Southern state. Yet she is not too
proud to come begging, and she flew back to New York with more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton to blame for all this bad feeling? In some ways.
She still seems unsure whether to be a sharp new woman or a
submissive housewife (not since Margaret Thatcher has anybody
delivered such brass-knuckled attacks while dressed in a ruffled
blouse).
</P>
<P>
   In New York she is undoubtedly a carpetbagger, and has pandered
excessively to various sectors of the electorate. She has some
White House scandals to haunt her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her treatment still seems disproportionate. Apparently,
political opportunists in ruffled blouses are less acceptable to
the public than those who wear pinstriped suits.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-Hillary campaigns carry an undoubted whiff of sexism.
An even larger number, though, seem to be motivated by a desire to
get even with her husband. &QL;

   RABAT _ Four decades after independence, 80 percent of Morocco's
villages and half of its population have yet to get paved roads,
electricity and running water. But at least the country's peasants
can now get mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco is claiming the fastest mobile-phone growth in the world
_ albeit from a low base. The number of subscribers in the country
has quadrupled in six months to 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the state regulator, ANRT, expects
mobile connections to exceed the number of land lines. The boom is
helping Morocco leapfrog generations of development. While fixed
lines cover 6 percent of the population, the mobile network covers
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new mobile phone operator, Meditel, a Spanish-led group, was
up and running within nine months of winning the tender last year.
Three satellite operators, who were awarded their VSAT licenses
this month, hope to have their networks operating within just a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a hierarchical kingdom in which the state controls everything
from the airwaves to babies' names, such liberalization is
startling. It stems from a law in 1997 which busted Maroc Telecom's
monopoly. ANRT plans to break its hold on land lines by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say the speed and transparency of Morocco's telecom
reforms are unparalleled in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The government's need for cash is driving the liberalization.
Last summer, Morocco confounded economists when the government
earned $1.1 billion from the sale of a second GSM license to
Meditel _ double the amount Egypt, with twice the population,
earned from a similar sale. VSAT licenses are fetching $4 million a
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, the partial privatization of Maroc Telecom is
earmarked to bring another $1.5 billion into state coffers. The
sale is attracting bids from as far afield as Italy and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms are winning Morocco the regional edge. Across the
continent, only South Africa and Egypt have a higher mobile phone
penetration. While security-obsessed Tunisia and Algeria still
struggle with a single low-capacity GSM network, Morocco is
planning its third.
</P>
<P>
   Tunisia was the first country in Africa to market the Internet,
and helped launch the Web in Morocco. Today Tunisia has two
Internet providers, one owned by the president's daughter, the
other by a close relation, and Morocco has hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors now talk of turning Morocco into a regional hub. In a
heavily regulated region, Morocco's telecom sector has become a
pilot for a new way of administration. The regulator, not the
Ministry of Telecommunications, is in charge, and acts as an
independent arbitrator. Tariffs tumble, as Moroccans get a taste of
corporate competition.

   The World Bank hopes this new way of doing things will be
contagious: if it works in telecoms, it might also succeed in
transport. There has even been talk of liberalizing radio and
television. Who knows where it all might end? &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Under doddery Boris Yeltsin, Russian prime ministers
were the men who more or less ran the country, interrupted by the
odd snarl from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The job was exciting but usually brief. In the nine years of his
presidency, Yeltsin got through six prime ministers. Only one
lasted more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   For Mikhail Kasyanov, whom the undoddery Vladimir Putin
nominated as acting prime minister after the presidential
inauguration on May 7, things look set to be rather different.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the jealous Yeltsin could manage only a few hours' work
a week, and usually sacked his prime ministers for becoming too
popular, Putin is both fully in charge and less neurotic; a
well-regarded government will bolster his standing.
</P>
<P>
   The first big question facing Kasyanov is the role of the new
government, due to be announced later this month. Will it be a
political entity, as in the Yeltsin era, or a merely administrative
one, as in Soviet times, when its job was to carry out the orders
of the Communist Party?
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Putin's thinking tends towards the latter,
with a powerful Kremlin handing down instructions.
</P>
<P>
   A document published by a Russian newspaper last week,
supposedly leaked from the Kremlin, also suggested a central role
for the security services in managing politics, and a new
``political council'' to corral the main political parties behind
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians, so far, sound shocked. Even so, this would still
leave Kasyanov with the daunting task of creating an efficient
government, something Russia has never enjoyed in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The lower ranks of the civil service _ backward, ill trained and
underpaid _ are a swamp of waste and corruption. At the top, the
ministries in recent years have mostly been autonomous baronies.
Ministers and top civil servants all too often treat their work as
a source of speedy enrichment rather than public service.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in ministries dealing with natural resources, for
example, are ``owned'' by one or other of the big companies
involved, which in turn often belong or are linked to the
self-important tycoons known as oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   The fusion of their political and commercial interests in the
upper reaches of power has had pernicious results. An early test
will be whether Putin replaces the most spectacularly incompetent
and greedy figures, and with whom.
</P>
<P>
   A shuffle in January bumped some from the Yeltsin era down a
notch or two, but fell far short of a clean-out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of bringing in ``market-minded professionals,''
Putin has yet to make a drastic break with the previous gang;
admittedly, finding experienced, able, honest candidates would be
hard at the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   The soberest hope is that the businesslike Kasyanov may try to
nudge his government away from the worst habits of the past.
</P>
<P>
   What else will he manage in the Russia murkily emerging under
President Putin? Views on the 42-year-old Kasyanov differ.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Solntsevo, outside Moscow, a town with the reputation in
Russia that Palermo has in Italy, he spent the first decade of his
career as an obscure bureaucrat, perhaps _ like so many of Putin's
early favorites _ with links to the intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   In his main job since communism's collapse, renegotiating
Russia's foreign debts, he sharpened his excellent English, while
proving a quick-witted and decisive deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks partly to such qualities, Russia managed the unusual feat
of restructuring its debt to western banks twice in three years.
That was a striking achievement, given that its public finances
were actually looking relatively sound. But he was lucky too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the records he set were rather wind-assisted,'' notes
a foreigner who often dealt with him. ``People (in the West) didn't
want those negotiations to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Competent fixer that he is, it is too soon to say whether
Kasyanov's talent goes beyond manipulating the conflicting greed,
fear and impatience of western bankers. The bits of government he
has worked in, chiefly the finance ministry, are not stellar
examples of openness and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kasyanov is not said to have been involved in the
unorthodox financial practices of the Yeltsin years, which included
unaccounted-for international loans, off-the-books government
spending and mysterious tax breaks for well-connected companies, he
has not gone out of his way to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   He condemns corruption, but seems to define it narrowly, in
terms of specific cases of wrongdoing, rather than as something
endemic to a rotten system.
</P>
<P>
   Another big question hangs over his friendship with Russia's
most influential oligarch, Boris Berezovsky. One reform-minded
former deputy prime minister, Boris Nemtsov, says that Kasyanov's
appointment would mean ``the continuation of the oligarchs' rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Putin has said he will ``eliminate'' the oligarchs ``as a
class,'' the early signs are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The Putin-Kasyanov duo have in effect run Russia since January,
during which time Berezovsky and his chums have added the aluminium
industry to their empire, without even token resistance from the
government's anti-monopoly watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Like Putin, Kasyanov is by Russian standards well travelled and
well informed. Like Putin, he gives the strong impression of
believing politics is a zero-sum game: one side's gain is always
the other's loss.
</P>
<P>
   And like Putin, he shows little interest in human rights, and
has so far had trouble matching words to deeds. ``We are working
out a very ambitious reform program to be implemented immediately
after the presidential elections,'' Kasyanov promised a plutocrats'
gathering in Davos in January.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the program is a mystery. Kasyanov will certainly
provide a confident face to Putin's Russia, smooth or abrasive as
required.
</P>
<P>
   His government may be less shambolic than past administrations.
It may well condone more authoritarian and ruthless methods than
those of its post-Soviet predecessors; there is no sense of the
squeamish about Kasyanov.
</P>
<P>
   But will he deliver? Not unless he shows much more enthusiasm
for genuine economic, political and moral regeneration. &QL;

   &UR; THE NRA CANDIDATE: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In a video, a senior official of the National Rifle Association
suggested that the NRA would be able to ``work out'' of the Oval
Office if George W. Bush is elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush accused Al Gore, who staunchly supports gun
control these days, of being a member of the NRA. The NRA cannot
find any record of Gore's membership, but points out that Gore
received a high rating from them when he was a congressman from
Tennessee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENDORSEMENT OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain finally endorsed Bush on May 9 after a
meeting between the two in Pittsburgh. McCain said he looked
forward to campaigning ``enthusiastically'' for the Texas governor.
But he also admitted the endorsement was a case of ``take the
medicine now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HONEST ANSWER OF THE WEEK: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably because I liked the way it tasted. I _ there is
nothing better than a cold beer and Mexican food, cold beer and
barbeque.'' (Bush on why he took up drinking, ``20/20,'' ABC, May
5) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP QUIZ: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I thought you meant some band. The Taliban in Afghanistan!
Absolutely. Repressive.'' (Bush in Glamour magazine, June 2000) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREDICTION: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are going to fall asleep watching the drab
debate the dreary.'' (Ralph Nader, Green Party candidate, warning
voters what to expect if third-party candidates are not involved in
this autumn's presidential debates,``Meet the Press,'' May 7) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMPLIMENT: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Al Gore over the last ten days. He's been the attack
dog. I mean, he's been James Carville with more hair and less
charm.'' (Senator Mitch McConnell, CNN, May 7) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOT-SO-WOODEN MAN: &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, the Associated Press reported that, in private, Gore
sings country songs with an exaggerated twang. Then the New York
Times reported that he wowed an audience of the Anti-Defamation
League with a routine about Jewish country music (sample: ``I was
one of the chosen people _ until she chose someone else.'') &QL;

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bullish on social security choices

Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   George W. Bush outlined a plan today that would allow workers to
invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts. He also
promised to strengthen Medicare. Speaking at a senior citizens'
center outside Los Angeles, Bush didn't specify how large a portion
could be put in private accounts, but the most commonly discussed
option has been 2 percentage points of the current 12.4 percent
Social Security payroll tax. Bush also pledged to maintain current
benefits for those at or near retirement; put payroll taxes off
limits to prevent borrowing against the Social Security trust fund;
refuse to increase the current 12.4 percent payroll tax used to
fill the trust fund; preserve the system's current benefit payments
to widows, widowers and the disabled; and refuse to let the
government itself invest Social Security funds, preferring instead
to let individuals make the choice. Al Gore, speaking today outside
Philadelphia, argued that it is risky to chance retirement savings
on the whims of the stock market. He warned that taxpayers and the
government could be put in a position where they'll have to provide
``an S&AMP;L-type bailout for those retirees whose investments don't
pan out.'' But says Bush: ``He trusts the government to manage our
retirement; I trust individual Americans. I trust Americans to make
their own decisions and manage their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   BUT REPUBLICANS WITH AMBITIONS ARE WAITING
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani said today he still hasn't decided on what
treatment he'll get for his prostate cancer, let alone whether
he'll continue his Senate bid. He disputed a Newsweek report that
he had decided on surgery and radiation. He said he's learned from
talking with others with cancer that ``you change your mind about
it probably 10 times before you make the decision'' on treatment.
But he did say he had canceled planned fund-raisers in California
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Newsweek, citing unidentified sources,
reported that Giuliani chose ``the most extensive and
time-consuming course of treatment'' and that it would force him to
quit the race against Hillary Clinton. Democrats were predicting
that Giuliani's campaign is finished.
</P>
<P>
   THEY LIKE GOOD SCHOOLS, BUT NOT TAXES
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who has struggled with the
question of how to fund the state's schools, confirmed today she'll
seek a third term, but didn't say whether she'll renew her pledge
to veto an income tax. Shaheen had dodged the question for months,
prompting some to speculate she wouldn't take the traditional
pledge to veto the tax. New Hampshire, along with Alaska, are the
only states without a personal state income tax or general sales
tax, and anti-tax sentiment in New Hampshire runs high. But Shaheen
and state legislators have been grappling with an education funding
crisis triggered by a state Supreme Court order in late 1997 to
find a fairer way to pay for schools. Shaheen will face state Sen.
Mark Fernald, who supports a state income tax to solve the school
problem, in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BRADLEY POW-WOW IN THE WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's aides, according to USA Today, anticipate an
announcement, possibly this week, about a joint appearance between
their boss and Bill Bradley. Such an appearance would end two
months of estrangement, the aftermath of a bitter competition
between a vice president who wanted a clear field and his
ex-senator challenger. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane was quoted as
saying the campaigns are in ``close contact,'' but Bradley aides
say the two sides have had a ``non-relationship'' since Bradley
quit the race March 9. He has not spoken to Gore since, and
aide-to-aide calls have been rare.
</P>
<P>
   CINDY TO LEAD ARIZONANS IN PHILLY
</P>
<P>
   In the end, John McCain got his wish: His wife will lead the
Arizona delegation to the GOP convention this summer. Cindy McCain
was chosen at a state convention over the weekend after Gov. Jane
Hull stepped aside, stressing the need for party unity. McCain's
home state is one of seven he won during the primaries. By
installing his wife as delegation head, McCain assures himself
additional media exposure at the convention in Philadelphia: She'll
be the one announcing delivering Arizona's 30 delegates on national
TV. Hull had endorsed George W. Bush, which ticked off McCain. The
dispute simmered even after McCain dropped out. When Hull disclosed
her desire to lead the delegation, McCain dismissed the idea during
a nationally televised interview, expressing the preference for his
wife. This, in turn, angered Hull and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN MIFFED IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain canceled plans to campaign for Michigan
congressional candidates this week in what the Detroit News called
``an angry reaction'' to the Michigan GOP's choices for convention
delegates. McCain political director John Weaver said Michigan Gov.
John Engler and state GOP chairman Rusty Hills ``failed to keep
commitments'' to elect ``true McCain activists.'' Instead, most of
them are George W. Bush supporters who are pledged to vote McCain
on the first ballot. McCain had captured 52 of the state's 58
delegates but released six of them to Bush so Engler and others
could attend the convention.
</P>
<P>
   `PRETTY GOOD CHANCE' IN TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says he can win Tennessee in November even though
it's Al Gore's home state, and that he'll campaign there often.
``That's a state where I have a pretty good chance,'' he told
interviewers in Austin, because a lot of Tennessee people don't
want four more years of Clinton-Gore.'' The reasons Bush thinks he
can win there: the Clinton-Gore ticket carried the state by 2
percentage points in 1996, and that Tennessee has a Republican
governor (Don Sundquist) and two GOP senators (Fred Thompson and
Bill Frist). The most recent Tennessee poll, a two-month-old
Mason-Dixon survey, showed Gore leading 47-41 percent, with a 4
percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR MR. GOODVOTE
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an Al Gore presidency, the New York Times
reports, leaves many women unexcited, even those who are longtime
Democrats. ``I don't like the way he carries himself,'' the Times
quoted a Carla Hannan-Welch as saying. ``I see him putting his foot
in his mouth a lot.'' Helen Rabichow, a Chicago Democrat, has
conflicting feelings about Gore: ``I think he's kind of a nice
jerk. He's a well-meaning, nice guy. But that doesn't necessarily
mean that will make him a good president.'' But George W. Bush
doesn't seem to be impressing many women, either. ``I don't think
either one of them is really capable,'' an Irene Cohen was quoted
as saying. ``If I had to go to the polls right now, I'd vote for
Mickey Mouse.''

MAKING AIRPORTS MORE TOLERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 21) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there a nice place to eat here?'' I asked the Delta counter
agent at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in
Florida one afternoon last month. ``Next door,'' responded the
agent, Linda Cartisano. ``Behind the Continental counter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfgang Puck?'' I said hopefully. ``Oh, don't I wish,''
Cartisano said. ``Listen, even a Starbucks would make out like a
bandit in this place. At 6 o'clock, everything begins to shut down
and there are still flights going out until 9:30. It's really too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And really too bad is roughly what most people think of long
waits at airports. But as a Port Authority official in New York
pointed out, because passengers now must arrive an hour or more
ahead of their departures, some companies see captive customers for
better wares and are moving in. This trend is fueled by huge
expansions at airports.
</P>
<P>
   So after telling Cartisano to hang on because Wolfgang Puck was
now franchising airport restaurants, I walked around the corner to
Fort Lauderdale's Terminal 3 restaurant. I instantly understood her
regretful tone. It proved to be the usual: a disappointing steam
table and a salad bar festooned with iceberg lettuce and thick
dressings.
</P>
<P>
   I had been keeping a list of innovations at American airports
that make time there more bearable, and had gone to Fort Lauderdale
as a scout. The most recent changes were at a rental car station,
completing a tally of seven signs that comfort and air travel
aren't always clashing concepts _ at least on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo center is five minutes by jitney from the terminals. A
spokeswoman, Cheryl Budd, said that 75 percent of Alamo's average
of 15,000 daily customers in Fort Lauderdale were leisure travelers
and that the company had concluded that formulas for business
renters did not fit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Alamo, which has headquarters in the city, called in researchers
two years ago, who saw that families were unstrapping luggage on
the floor and changing from winter wardrobes to shorts and T-shirts
and back again right there. When the rental cars wheeled away, they
headed for a convenience store, for snacks and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The rental plaza was enlarged and remodeled. Seats and benches
were added, along with a play area and a canteen with a
refrigerator, tables and chairs. Prices for sodas and coffee were
matched to off-airport prices, with a regular coffee at $1.05 and a
soft drink $1. Four cubicles with benches are being installed for
those who want to change.
</P>
<P>
   Using this model, Alamo (www.alamo.com) plans to revamp
locations in Orlando, Tampa, Denver, Las Vegas and Los Angeles by
the end of the year. Other locations will incorporate certain
features.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Puck's advent as an airport eating place deserves a
spot even on a short list. A colleague and her family ate at a
branch at O'Hare in Chicago, and while it was not Spago itself, she
said she was pleased with the wood-oven pizza and the attentive
service.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Warner, senior vice president of Wolfgang Puck Food Co. in
Santa Monica, Calif., said the company had franchised two units at
O'Hare to Host-Marriott, one at Denver to a private operator, and
two at Los Angeles International to CA One Services.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said that Puck frozen foods were not used at airports,
but that specialists were sent in to train employees and they
sometimes dropped by later to check quality.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop Lane got on the list when a friend reported last August
that under the motto ``peace, quiet and a T-1 line,'' she had found
a place at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta to gather
her scattered thoughts and e-mail messages. These
offices-by-the-minute are now in 12 airports, with two more due
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The centers, with concierges at the entrance, are carved into
cubicles with a locking door, counter, personal computer and modem
or T-1 line hookup. I later tried one and found it no more
depressing than most offices. But after searching through three
terminals in Fort Lauderdale for a place to plug in both a laptop
and its modem line, I would have paid lots more than the company's
rate for any place, however small, to sit down and plug in.
</P>
<P>
   The rates include long-distance phone service in the United
States, the ability to send and receive faxes and the use of a
plain-paper printer. The first five minutes cost $2 and each
additional minute 38 cents. The centers are open daily, for as long
as 16 hours in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop Lanes are at O'Hare; Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky; Denver
International; Hartsfield-Atlanta; Seattle-Tacoma; Dallas-Fort
Worth; Detroit; La Guardia in New York; Philadelphia; Phoenix Sky
Harbor; Tampa and Raleigh. Information: (425) 653-2000;
www.laptoplane.com.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most exasperating part of waiting around an airport
alone in the days of high security is having to haul carry-on
luggage every place, even into a bathroom. So, the resurgence of
the locker gets a place on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Smarte Carte, a St. Paul, Minn., company with
luggage-cart concessions, has created banks of lockers in 35
domestic airports that use punch-in codes rather than keys. The
unique code is printed on the receipt.
</P>
<P>
   The lockers are big enough for several suitcases, and the
installation includes a change-making machine. In Fort Lauderdale,
the initial fee was $1, which provides half an hour of storage; to
retrieve, one pays $1 for each additional half-hour, up to $6 for
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The security concerns that led the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey to rip out storage lockers after a bomb at La
Guardia killed 11 people in 1975 still exist. Smarte Carte says its
electronic controls permit the company to pop open all the doors at
once, and also permit emptying on a daily basis.

   At New York's airports, there are still no lockers. There are
baggage storage areas at each, and Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the
Port Authority, says that the clerks may ask to look into bags
before they are checked. These facilities close at 9, 10 or 11
p.m., depending on the site. The fees range up to $15 a day. At
Kennedy, they are in Terminals 1, 4E and 4W; at Newark, in Terminal
B; at La Guardia, at the US Airways and Delta terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of a top-drawer hotel right in an airport where
people connect for overseas flights is good news, and Hilton opened
one at Logan International in Boston in September. The 10-story,
600-room hotel has a big restaurant, a major plus since Logan is
dug up and travel into the city is impeded by the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are $159 to $299 a night for a standard room. The hotel
has moving walkways into Terminals A and E. Hilton Boston Logan,
Boston, Mass. 02128; (617) 569-9300.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hilton at Logan opens some facilities to people who are
not guests: for $9 a day, a weary traveler can use a shower; for
$15, anyone can use the workout equipment, pool and whirlpool, as
well as showers.
</P>
<P>
   A company called 24 Hour Fitness in Pleasanton, Calif., a major
operator west of the Mississippi, opened essentially a full gym at
McCarran Airport in Las Vegas in February. If you packed workout
clothes in your carry-on, $15 will buy you a day's admission and a
towel. If not, $30 buys you access, shorts, shirt, socks and a
towel and rental of shoes. There is a steam room and sauna as well
as and locker rooms. The club is open 24 hours a day; (702)

<P>
   Take Me Out to ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. With the opening of baseball season and three new major
league ballparks, I'd like to see some classic parks, like Fenway
Park, Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field or County Stadium, before they
close. Is there a company with trips to these parks? _ Peter
Thomas, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. With one exception, you have plenty of time to see those four
parks. There are no serious plans to replace Wrigley Field in
Chicago or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, and the Boston Red Sox say
they won't open a new Fenway until at least 2003. Milwaukee's
County Stadium is in its last year, though, so you may want to get
there before the Brewers move to Miller Park next season.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three companies specializing in taking people
out to the ballpark. But the one trip going to all four of those
old stadiums requires a good chunk of the season: Sports Travel
Inc.'s Millennium Tour visits all 30 major league parks and the
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown from July 14 to Aug. 17. The cost,
including air and ground transportation, hotels and game tickets,
is $5,995 a person, double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Travel offers two other trips that each go to two of
those parks. One is the Windy City tour, July 1 to 3, taking in
games at Wrigley and Comiskey Park in Chicago, and one in
Milwaukee. It costs $595, double occupancy, including bus, tickets
and two nights at the Wyndham in Chicago. The Classic, July 19 to
23, goes to Baltimore; Yankee Stadium; Cooperstown; and Fenway
Park. The $1,050 cost includes tickets, bus and double rooms in the
Baltimore Hilton and the Grand Hyatt in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Sports Travel at 60 Main Street, Hatfield, Mass. 01038;
(800) 662-4424, fax (413) 247-5700; www.4sportstravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   From July 13 to 19, Diamond Baseball Tours, 121 Blackberry
Drive, Morehead, Ky. 40351, is offering a Hall of Fame tour that
begins with a game in Detroit's new Comerica Park and goes to
Toronto, Cooperstown, Boston, Yankee Stadium and Baltimore. The
$770 double occupancy price includes bus travel, game tickets, Hall
of Fame admission and lodging in Best Westerns, Ramadas, Comfort
Inns and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, July 20 to 27, Diamond has a trip to Cleveland,
Yankee Stadium, the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Boston,
Baltimore, Shea Stadium (the Mets) and Pittsburgh. The cost is
$950, double. Diamond is at (800) 275-1567, fax (606) 783-1816;
www.diamondbaseballtours.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Roadtrips, 191 Lombard Ave., Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada, R3B 0X1, (800) 465-1765, fax (204) 957-1241, has
similar tours, but none go to more than one of those classic parks.
But it will, an agent said, customize itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Hiking Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to arrange moderate day hikes in the Sedona and
Grand Canyon areas in Arizona during a coming trip. Are there
companies that lead such hikes? _ Dolores Swirin, Bronx, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Sedona Chamber of Commerce, (800) 288-7336, says most
tours of the famous red rock country are in four-wheel-drive
vehicles. But it did suggest two outfits for hikes.
</P>
<P>
   At one, Sedona Adventures, Cindy Panettiery, the reservations
manager, said her company would arrange guided tours of two and a
half or four hours for at least four people. The guide will plan
the route with the party, based on fitness levels, and secure any
necessary permits for the National Forest. Some of the easier
trails available are Doe Mesa, Devil's Bridge and Bear Wall;
moderate ones include Bear Sign, Schnebly Diagonal and Secret
Canyon. The cost is $45 a person for the shorter hikes and $65 for
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona Adventures, Post Office Box 1476, Sedona, Ariz. 86339;
(800) 888-9494, fax (520) 282-9055.
</P>
<P>
   The other hiking guide goes by the name Rahelio and runs Sedona
Nature Excursions, (520) 282-6735, fax 282-0134, www.rahelio.com.
He says he specializes in Native American spiritual experiences but
also leads fitness hikes. Some of the trails he goes to are Boynton
Canyon, Bear Mountain and Schnebly Hill. Rates are $45 for two and
a half hours and $65 for three and a half, but somewhat more for a
single hiker.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Grand Canyon is such a harsh environment, hiking
there is serious business, according to Margee Hench, a former
ranger who is the communications specialist at the Grand Canyon
National Park. So, she recommends asking these questions of any
potential guides:
</P>
<P>
   Are they insured? How much experience do they have as guides in
the Grand Canyon? If you want a multiday hike, can they guarantee
having park permits for the days you want to go? And finally, do
they hold at least a Wilderness First Responder card, a level below
Emergency Medical Technician?
</P>
<P>
   The park's Web site, www.thecanyon.com/nps, lists the park's
licensed back-country guides. Of these, two can be hired through
South Rim Travel, in Williams, Ariz., (888) 291-9116, fax (520)
625-9039: Canyon Dreams, which charges $95 a day per person ($50 a
half day) for day hikes, and Grand Canyon Trail Guides, whose
eight-hour hikes cost $125 each, including lunch.
</P>
<P>
   You can get information and advice about weather and trail
conditions from the national park's Back Country Office, (520)
638-7875, 1 to 5 p.m. local time, Monday to Friday. A serious fire
forced the closure of the North Rim of the park last week; for
updates, call (520) 638-7922 ot see www.nps.gov/grca/fire.
</P>
<P>
   Learning About Okinawa
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to take a grandniece to Okinawa, where she was born,
but haven't been able to get tourist information around here. Can
you help? _ Ruth W. Cupp, Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. A spokeswoman for the Japan National Tourist Organization in
New York, Marian Goldberg, said her organization offers information
about Okinawa. Write to the JNTO, 1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250,
New York, N.Y. 10020, or call (212) 757-5640, or fax (212)
307-6754.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web site www.jnto.go.jp/regions/okinawa is a good
starting place. It tells you, for example, that this prefecture
consists of 57 islands (17 uninhabited), has a subtropical climate
with more than 3,000 varieties of plants, and reefs with 260
species of coral.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa Island, the largest, is a two-and-a-half-hour flight
from Tokyo and culturally quite different from the rest of Japan.
The main city, Naha, is perhaps the most modern architecturally in
Japan, a result of the destruction from American bombings in World
War II. For other information on Japan, see
www.japantravelinfo.com.

DON'T BE AGOG AT DEMAGOGUING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rousing speech to an AFL-CIO convention in New Jersey, Vice
President Al Gore used the attack word  &UR; secret &LR;  seven times. It is
now his favorite adjective, having temporarily replaced  &UR; risky &LR;  (as
in the phrase, pronounced as one word,  &UR; riskytaxscheme &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   He was blazing away at Gov. Bush's proposal, not yet detailed,
to allow individuals to divert a portion of their Social Security
taxes into the stock market. Gore charged that Bush believed ``it
would be best not to let you, the voters of this country, in on the
 &UR; secret plan &LR;  before the election .... He is suppressing the
details of how his plan would work and refusing to divulge what his
 &UR; secret plan &LR;  really is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a subsequent news conference, Gore evidently felt that
 &UR; secret &LR;  was not pejorative enough and added, redundantly, a
``private  &UR; secret plan &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That sinister phrase _  &UR; secret plan &LR;  _ has resonance to veteran
rhetoricians and students of presidential campaigns. In the 1968
primaries, candidate Richard Nixon was searching for a way to
promise he would extricate the United States from its increasingly
unpopular involvement in Vietnam. The key verb to be used was
 &UR; end &LR; , though it would be nice to get the verb  &UR; win &LR;  in some
proximity to it.
</P>
<P>
   One speechwriter came up with the formulation that ``new
leadership will  &UR; end &LR;  the war and  &UR; win &LR;  the peace in the Pacific.''
Nixon made it part of his stump speech, and the juxtaposition of
 &UR; end &LR;  and  &UR; win &LR;  _ though it did not claim to intend to  &UR; win &LR;  the
war, but only the peace _ drove his major opponent for the GOP
nomination, Gov. George Romney of Michigan, up the wall.
</P>
<P>
   When a UPI reporter pressed Nixon for specifics, the candidate
demurred; the reporter wrote that it seemed Nixon was determined to
keep his plan  &UR; secret &LR; , though he did not quote Nixon as having
said either  &UR; secret &LR;  or  &UR; plan &LR; . But this gave Romney a chance to
slam back at his opponent's promise.
</P>
<P>
   In what became the centerpiece of his stump speech in the snows
of New Hampshire, Romney demanded to know, ``Where is your  &UR; secret
plan &LR; ?'' That question skillfully presupposed an assertion of not
just a general promise but also a detailed plan, and soon it became
widely accepted that Nixon had said, ``I have a  &UR; secret plan &LR;  to
end the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when a New York Times columnist attributed that
direct quote to Nixon, a White House speechwriter challenged him to
find the quote in anything taken down by pencil or recorder at the
time. The pundit searched high and low and had to admit the
supposed remark was unsourceable. (Look, the Nixon speechwriter was
me and the columnist was my current colleague, Tony Lewis; I didn't
have to research this.)
</P>
<P>
   During Ronald Reagan's run for re-election in 1984, Democrats
took a leaf from the Romney playbook and charged him with having a
 &UR; secret plan &LR;  to raise taxes after the election. This forced Reagan
to say defensively he would raise taxes only ``as a last resort''
and reminded politicians that the old  &UR; secret-plan &LR;  charge had
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore, a few weeks before he leveled the tried-and-true
phrase at Bush, showed he was aware of its old-chestnuttiness. In a
hilarious, deadpan, self-mocking speech to the Gridiron Club in
Washington, he was widely reported to have said he had a  &UR; secret
plan &LR;  to win the White House: He would claim credit for all the
good stuff that had happened in the past eight years and dissociate
himself from the bad stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George W. Bush has been using an attack word of his
own to characterize the Gore approach to Social Security: ``For
eight years,'' he wrote in a fund-raising letter, ``Clinton/Gore
has had history's greatest opportunity to reform Social Security.
They chose to  &UR; demagogue &LR;  the problem, not repair it.''
</P>
<P>
   I kept this letter, sent to me by its recipient, Leila Hadley
Luce of New York, to note the use of the beslashed singular subject
 &UR; Clinton/Gore &LR; , followed properly by the singular verb  &UR; has &LR; , but
then followed incorrectly by  &UR; they &LR; .  &UR; Clinton/Gore &LR;  is a team and
takes an  &UR; it &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But Luce's covering note questioned the use of the ``new verb,''
 &UR; to demagogue &LR; . Originally a noun, this was formed from the Greek
 &UR; demos &LR; , ``people,'' and  &UR; agogos &LR; , ``leading''; it meant ``leader
of the mob'' and now has the derogatory meaning of ``a politician
who appeals to people's emotions.'' The noun can be used
attributively to do the work of an adjective: Robert Southey in
1812 denounced ``the venom and the virulence of the  &UR; demagogue &LR; 
journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot be faulted for using  &UR; demagogue &LR;  as a verb. It was
coined in that form by James Harrington in his 1656 utopian theory,
``Commonwealth of Oceana.'' He picked up the noun coined five years
earlier by Thomas Hobbes and wrote of a time ``when that same
ranting fellow Alcibiades fell a  &UR; demagoging &LR;  for the Sicilian
war.'' In 1890, The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette wrote of
President Benjamin Harrison, ``The president never thought of
 &UR; demagoging &LR;  the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Note the lack of a  &UR; u &LR;  in those usages of what most of us would
until recently spell as  &UR; demagoguing &LR; . But we live in a non-U
world; just as  &UR; catalogue &LR;  and  &UR; dialogue &LR;  have been dropping their
 &UR; ue &LR;  endings, so too will  &UR; demagogue &LR;  soon enough be spelled
 &UR; demagog &LR; , with its gerund  &UR; demagoging &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard word for the mob to handle;  &UR; demagogic &LR;  is
pronounced with the final g soft, rhyming with  &UR; logic &LR; , but
 &UR; demagoguery &LR;  has the final  &UR; g &LR;  hard, rhyming with  &UR; toggery &LR; . (Get
away from that e-mail key; there is such a word. It means
``clothing.'')
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore now assail Bush for harboring a  &UR; secret plan &LR;  to
attack him for  &UR; demagoguery &LR; ? Will Bush lash back in a debate by
demanding he spell it? Both sides are now armed.

<P>
   MOUNT ST. HELENS NATIONAL VOLCANIC MONUMENT, Wash. _ Here at the
foot of a still snow-covered Mount St. Helens, a gentle, new spring
is hatching as alder trees leaf out, the first warblers sing,
salamanders squirm out of gooey eggs and the Toutle River rushes
toward its destination.
</P>
<P>
   But while peaceful today, 20 years ago this valley was rocked as
Mount St. Helens exploded in an eruption so powerful that it shot
ash and steam out at more than 200 mph, filled this broad valley
with the largest landslide in recorded human history and flattened
trees over hundreds of square miles _ in minutes, changing this
landscape forever.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of Mount St. Helens, the two-decade anniversary of
which will be marked this Thursday, has also radically changed the
way that biologists look at the creation and recovery of natural
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, researchers say it was dogma among ecologists that
nature creates and recreates ecosystems in an orderly fashion with
predictable parades of species rolling in: the early pioneering
species first, which alter the environment, making possible the
arrival of the second wave of species and so on, until the final
array of plants and animals is in place.
</P>
<P>
   By providing the perfect laboratory to test such ideas _ more
than 200 square miles of newly devastated terrain _ Mount St.
Helens has turned that theory upside down. Biologists have
discovered instead the unpredictability of recolonization and the
pivotal importance of chance in the rebuilding of biological
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew very clearly what was going to happen afterward,''
said Dr. Jerry Franklin, a forest ecologist at the University of
Washington, ``and we were very clearly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons learned, researchers say, have provided critical
insights for foresters, conservationists and others looking to
rebuild ecosystems that have been drastically altered.
</P>
<P>
   Because St. Helens was also the first massive eruption in a
developed country within driving distance of a number of major
universities, it is unrivaled as a model for ecosystem recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity of the work that is being carried out there,''
said Dr. Eldon Franz, an ecosystem ecologist at Washington State
University, ``I don't think it will be matched anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the 20-year mark, with tiny, forest-like patches of
alders taking hold, brave clumps of sedges, fireweeds and lupines
clinging to the rocky hills, and moths, trout and bluebirds
increasing their numbers, researchers are finally beginning to see,
not just how a few lucky survivors can hold on, but what happens as
whole communities of species begin to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out the struggling young willows that have begun to
feel the effects of the growing corps of animals _ from stem-boring
beetles, to leaf-chewing elk to trunk-biting beavers _ Charlie
Crisafulli, an ecologist at the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest
Research Station, said, ``Now things are really going to get
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while standing here on heaps of volcanic debris, staring
into the remains of the exploded crater, it is hard to take in the
enormousness of the events on that fateful day.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, a lush Northwestern forest was transformed into
a variety of entirely novel habitats. The pyroclastic zone, also
known as the pyroclastic flow, was created where hot pumice poured
out of the volcano sterilizing the earth. The debris avalanche
consisted of a 14-mile landslide of ash and rocks, some the size of
large buildings. The blowdown zone consisted of countless conifers
burnt to a crisp and toppled over like so many seared toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the neat logic of ecological theory, mosses and
lichens, able to survive the harshest conditions, should have been
the first to take hold in these ruined places. Then wildflowers and
other herbs should have come in, followed by deciduous trees and
finally conifers like the firs and hemlocks. And re-colonization
should have rolled inward from the edges where life remained
unharmed to the core of the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what created the new landscape was not this set of
rules but the organisms that were lucky enough to survive the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   In this largely lifeless scene, biologists soon discovered
pockets of survivors _ biological legacies as they are now called.
Moles, northern pocket gophers and ants made it through the blast
as they were hidden beneath the ground. Saplings and shrubs that
were still buried in early spring snow survived the blast that
killed the taller trees poking up above them. A few roots and bulbs
of wildflowers, like lupines and fireweeds, tumbled along the top
of the rolling avalanche, as opposed to being buried 600 feet
below, and set up shop as soon as the ground stopped moving.
</P>
<P>
   From a few such crucial hangers on sprinkled here and there
throughout the devastation, much of the first life here has slowly
sprung _ a process scientists now recognize as a critical part of
recovery in any disturbed biological system.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Helens was the epiphany where finally the scales fell from
our eyes and we said, `Oh my gosh, we haven't been thinking
clearly,''' said Franklin. ``The most important things we need to
think about are the legacies left in the landscape. The richness of
the legacy of organisms that was there, the rapidity with which
recovery occurred and the incredible diversity of ways in which
organisms were able to survive _ it just astounded us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these findings, many foresters now leave 15
percent or more of the trees and deadwood behind after a harvest as
a kind of biological legacy to speed the rebirth of a new forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real value of all these studies, is what we can learn
about management for other human created systems,'' said Dr.
Virginia Dale, an ecologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee. ``We have strip mines and road sides and all kinds of
devastation created by human activities.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most extreme, St. Helens provided a chance for biologists
to study the recreation of habitats from a clean slate in the
pyroclastic zone, where an entirely new, sterilized surface was
laid down that had never before supported life.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still sorting out the many factors that allow
crucial nitrogen and carbon, the building blocks for living
organisms, to accumulate in the pyroclastic zone. But Franz said
they already know that chance played an important shaping role.
Wherever lupine seeds happen to blow in and find a crevice to take
hold, they begin laying down carbon and nitrogen in abundance.
Lupine plants are particularly well suited to this habitat, as they
can, with the help of bacteria, create their own sources of vital
nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Around the volcano, curious new communities are also beginning
to take shape. In many of the 120 new ponds created in the debris
avalanche and in Spirit Lake, the northwestern salamander has taken
up residence. But a major challenge to these animals is their habit
of leaving the water in search of forest, which at Mount St. Helens
can leave them wandering and dying in desert-like landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these challenges, the northwestern salamander is
thriving here, with help in part from species like the northern
pocket gopher and the elk.
</P>
<P>
   Crisafulli said his team finds traveling salamanders in nearly
every gopher tunnel they inspect. These creatures appear to be
making their way across the harsh terrain via the gopher's cool,
moist subway system. The elk assist by collapsing tunnels with
their hooves as they tromp along, creating easy entrance for the
salamanders into the underground transit.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with areas in which organisms have had the benefit of
millenniums to get established, St. Helens, researchers say,
remains a system out of whack. There are strange goings on, from
surprisingly large numbers of typically rare species, to species
found in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   Birds like pipits and rosy finches, typically only found in
sparse, high elevation areas, can be found in the low elevation
pyroclastic zone. Species like the western toad and the red-legged
frog, which are endangered or threatened elsewhere, flourish at
Mount St. Helens.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers guessed it might take several hundred years to
return to what once was, a grand, old growth forest, for example,
on the debris avalanche where evergreen trees now come up to a
person's knee and most of the ground is still barren.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of things could interfere with that long-term
prognosis. One is global warming, but the biggest is Mount St.
Helens itself, the most active volcano in the Cascade mountains,
with an average eruption cycle of 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the mountain had still not completely recovered
from an eruption in the 1800s when it exploded again in 1980. The
treeline had returned only part way up the flanks of Mount St.
Helens when the latest eruption interrupted its upward march.
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 short years into the process, scientists say they have
yet to learn just where all this change is headed or what will be
here on this very spot 10, 100 or more years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story,'' said Dr. Fred Swanson, a research geologist with
the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station, ``is just
unfolding.'' &QL;

<P>
   Arguments between couples can lead to battles inside the body.
If spouses feud without a satisfying resolution, health can suffer
significantly, researchers at Ohio State University have concluded.
Immune systems can be weakened and stress hormones increased.
</P>
<P>
   It's dinnertime in the Sharp home and grace is being said. The
Sharp family is thankful not only for the food on the table but the
unity now restored around it.
</P>
<P>
   High school sweethearts, the marriage of Chris and Katie Sharp
was nearly shattered by increasing conflict between them, disputes
both big and small. They reached the brink of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started having little problems, and we just stopped
communicating about them,'' says Chris. ``It just started creating
bigger and bigger problems that we weren't addressing. I'm a
stubborn and hardheaded person.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress took a toll on Katie's health, particularly at meals.
``A bite of food made me sick to my stomach, so physically it did
affect me,'' she says. Both partners were concerned about their
young son's well-being since he had witnessed much of the tension
and mutual frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Sharps are not alone. In two trials involving
120 couples, Ohio University psychologists studied partners
involved in relationship disputes. One study focused on newlyweds,
the other on husbands and wives married an average of 42 years. In
both groups, unresolved conflicts led to sickness.
</P>
<P>
   However, clinicians involved with the study concluded that, with
proper conflict resolution, marriage partners can enjoy less stress
through real listening and honest sharing of feelings and
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The men studied were more likely to withdraw from or tune out
during arguments, while the women were more likely to be distressed
about the argument well after a heated dispute.
</P>
<P>
   With the study, mental health practitioners who try to save
marriages _ counselors, social workers, psychiatrists,
psychologists, clergy _ now have the science to prove that
corrosive arguments with a partner are bad for your health.
</P>
<P>
   During the Ohio State University study, couples were brought in
for joint counseling sessions on current disputes. Researchers
measured the stress hormones in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the hormones was found to be linked not to the
disagreements themselves, but to the way couples fight and resolve
(or don't resolve) conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had a problem that they were talking about, but those
who talked about it in a hostile and negative way are the ones who
had the negative immune effects,'' reports Dr. George Solomon,
professor of psychiatry at the University of California Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon studies the way in which mind and the immune system
interact. He says it's important for couples to learn how to deal
with the conflicts and stress that are inevitable in any committed
relationship. In the study of the older couples, abrasive arguments
were tied to a weakening of certain aspects of immune response.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser of Ohio State University's new
Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research who was involved in both
studies, says that the findings from those headed toward golden
anniversaries were more unexpected than the findings from the
newlyweds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might expect that arguments would have less impact on
older couples because they've gone through these disagreements many
times before and have learned to deal with them,'' says
Kiecolt-Glaser. ``But that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides raised stress hormone levels, the older couples with
weaker immune measures also described their usual marital
disagreements as more negative.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of newlyweds, researchers concluded that one key to
lowering the stress during a couple's arguments was to concentrate
on the issues at hand and thus reduce the amount of negative
responses that resulted. The style of the fighting is most
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sarcasm, name-calling and backbiting are the problems,''
says Dr. Ronald Glaser, another researcher involved in the OSU
study.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest was the continued elevated stress hormone
levels of the women whose husbands withdrew from the arguments.
``We're probably seeing the results of the women thinking about and
reliving the argument throughout the day,'' Kiecolt-Glaser says.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharps experienced this gender difference. Says Katie,
``Whenever we would argue, I'd be up all night and he'd snore
within five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the researchers, while changes in immune response
were seen in both newlywed and older couples, the effects may have
greater consequences in older people as their immune systems are
already waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older adults have greater rates of illness and death due to
infectious diseases compared to younger people,'' Kiecolt-Glaser
says. ``Additional stress, such as from marital arguments, may put
them at greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neenah Amaral, a marriage, family and child counselor at the
Advanced Psychology Center in Southern California sees marriage
partners who are hurting in mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often see that there are psychological symptoms that lead to
physical symptoms when there's stress in a relationship or in
someone's life,'' she says. ``A lot of neck strain, headaches,
sometimes stomach aches.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based therapist helped the Sharps get back on
track through counseling. ``They learn how to fight fairly,'' says
Amaral. ``They learn how to negotiate. They learn how to listen to
one another ... communication can be developed to where there's
trust and respect between a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaral taught the Sharps standard dialogue techniques that
helped the couple rebuild their family. One tip for resolving
disputes: appreciate a spouse's background. ``Understand their
background, because we bring forward to today everything that we've
experienced and known from our childhood,'' says Amaral.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharps took their therapist's lessons to heart. ``You have
to look at the reason why you first got married,'' says Katie.
``It's harder to stay but it's worth it. We still, you know, butt
heads at things, but at least now I know how to address it,'' she
says.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   When Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard teed off on the moon,
television viewers got more than a lunar golf lesson. They also
caught a glimpse of the best reason we would have for revisiting
our celestial neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about building deep-space telescopes, mining helium-3 for
fusion reactors or any of the other practical reasons for
establishing a lunar colony. Earthlings just want to have fun, and
there is no place here that can match the excitement ``out there.''
Just getting there would be a kick in the pants as you blasted off
on the adventure of a lifetime. Once on the moon, which exerts only
one-sixth the gravitational tug of the Earth, you could break the
high jump, broad jump and pole vault records without breaking a
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   While you can't book a lunar getaway today, the prospect of
vacationing on the moon isn't a flight of imagination either.
Encouraged by the growing popularity of the extreme adventure craze
_ climbing Mount Everest, teasing killer sharks from inside steel
cages, that sort of thing _ space entrepreneurs took a poll to
learn if they could sell un-Earthly vacations. An astounding eight
out of 10 Americans under age 40 said they would go. And, one in 10
would dig deep into their pockets, paying as much as a year's
salary for a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the launch of a new growth industry, Rochester Institute
of Technology in New York and George Washington University in
Washington, D.C., have set up programs to train future space
tourism experts.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles
can learn the fine points of building lunar habitations from
world-renowned space architect Madhu Thangavelu. Exotic though
their specialties may be, these graduates will probably get to work
in their fields. Two major hotel chains and a major Japanese
construction company have announced plans for fixed and flying
lunar hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're on the edge of the technological knife. As
soon as Americans see the first commercial astronaut in space,
there will be a realization that the realms out there are not the
exclusive property of NASA,'' says David P. Gump. As the president
of LunaCorp of Arlington, Va., (www.lunacorp.com) which was founded
in 1989, he is one of the founding fathers of the space tourism
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Gump sees lunar tourism following the same trajectory as travel
to exotic locations here on Earth. ``At first it was only the movie
stars who could fly a DC-3 from coast to coast. Then airline travel
became a mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, LunaCorp is building the 21st century equivalent
of the 3D viewers that brought the wonders of the Wild West into
the parlor and awoke a wanderlust in 19th-century imaginations.
Being built in cooperation with the Robotics Institute of Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., the LunaCorp Icebreaker is a
wheeled robot that will allow Earthbound travelers to steer a
high-tech moon buggy over the dusty lunar soil.
</P>
<P>
   The vicarious thrills provided by a ride on the LunaCorp
Icebreaker, which is expected to arrive at the moon's south pole in
late 2003, could be just the icebreaker the space tourism industry
needs to get its plans off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really do want to get into space,'' says Apollo
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who is also a LunaCorp adviser. ``But they
are prevented by the cost.'' Depending upon whether you fly on a
Chinese rocket or NASA space shuttle, the price ranges from about
$2,000 to $10,000 a pound to reach orbit. The consensus is that it
will need to come down to below $100 before serious space tourism
can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets that take tourists from the Earth to the moon aren't
likely to have NASA nameplates.
</P>
<P>
   Except for encouraging rhetoric, the space agency has written
off lunar exploration and support for space tourism. Instead, the
road back to the moon is being driven by an unusual competition
that hearkens back to the early days of aviation, when the
impossible dream was to fly an airplane across the Atlantic Ocean.
In the true spirit of The Spirit of St. Louis, the X-Prize
Foundation has set up shop in the city that Lucky Lindy made famous
and raised $10 million in prize money for a modest but essential
first step to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   To claim the gold, a privately funded organization must fly
three people to an altitude of 62 miles. Then, and this is the hard
part, it must make a second trip within two weeks. So far, 16 teams
are officially in the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans do their most creative and best work when they're
competing,'' says competition founder and chairman Peter Diamandis.
``The X-Prize is looking to heat things up again by introducing a
constructive type of competition amongst the top rocket scientists
and entrepreneurs from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs have their eyes on the X-Prize because of the
unusual economics of space tourism. The costs of travel on Earth
are pretty much proportional to distance. It costs about twice as
much to drive 100 miles as 50. A ticket from New York to Hong Kong
is more expensive than a ticket to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In space travel, most of the costs are ``front loaded'' into the
first seconds after liftoff when the rocket gobbles most of its
fuel, literally kicking you into space. Liftoffs will be a fast and
furious thrill, but from the perspective of tour operators, not
exactly a money machine. Since staying in space costs only a tiny
fraction of what it costs to get into space, the profits in space
tourism will be made on long trips. And longer trips will require
more than a spacesuit and a place to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say that experiences with SkyLab and Mir have
solved these problems. ``The idea of living comfortably and safely
in space is quickly becoming a reality,'' says Gene Meyers,
president of Space Island Group (SIG) of Los Angeles. ``Given the
availability of proven technology, it's no longer a matter of how,
but when.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, SIG unveiled the interior design for an
Earth-orbiting hotel. Meyers envisions a space resort constructed
from the empty external fuel tanks of NASA space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled like a giant Ferris wheel, the resort will rotate very
slowly, about once a minute. This will simulate one-third to
one-half the gravity experienced on Earth. Dining, entertainment
and living quarters will be located along the outer section of the
ring. ``We've taken the space resort concept to the next level by
giving the public the opportunity to see just how livable space can
be,'' says Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   Successful Las Vegas hotel owner Robert Bigelow sees a flaw in
Earth-orbiting hotels that can be summarized in one word: boring.
His solution is a more interesting orbit, one that would take
tourists around the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Budget Suites of America, Bigelow has formed a new
company, Bigelow Aerospace, to advance his idea. He tells ``Popular
Mechanics'' that he plans to invest a half billion dollars in
technologies needed to develop an orbiting hotel that would shuttle
between the Earth and the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans call for the Earth-to-moon hotel to be a
half-mile long. It would slowly rotate to simulate about 40 percent
of the gravity here on Earth. A staff of 50 could be welcoming its
first flight of 100 guests aboard in about 15 years. The exact
departure date will depend upon the availability of a low-cost
launch vehicle, perhaps a design encouraged by the X-Prize.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel that circles the moon will be a prelude to a hotel on
the moon. Peter Inston, a British architect who has designed hotels
for the Hilton chain, has proposed a sprawling 5000-room domed
structure. It would be powered by the sun and receive its water
supply _ hotels use lots of water _ from lunar ice that may exist
in polar regions Former NASA engineer Gregory Bennett, who now runs
Bigelow Aerospace, worked out plans earlier in his career fro
pressurized clear plastic walkways so tourists could venture onto
the lunar surface.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are still at the satellite-launching stage of
developing a space presence, the Japanese have announced they plan
to be a major player in lunar recreational development. Shimizu, a
Japanese construction firm, says it has invested $3 million in
plans for luxury lunar condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to lively competition in the coming profession
of commercial space architecture,'' says Space Island's Meyers.
``It's a field crying out for new leaders _ and they are going to
get famous.''

NBC'S NEW FALL LINEUP INCLUDES SOME OLD `FRIENDS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC announced next fall's prime-time lineup Monday and this much
we know: No matter what Oprah says, magazines are out, newspapers
are in.
</P>
<P>
   It's the inescapable conclusion gleaned from a painstaking
analysis of NBC's direction for the 2000-2001 season. Besides
canceling the long-dead ``Suddenly Susan,'' a Brooke Shields sitcom
about magazine folk, the network is trimming to thrice a week the
number of times its own newsmagazine, ``Dateline NBC,'' appears.
</P>
<P>
   That alone is cause for sustained huzzahs and breaking out the
special-occasion hooch. But holy Lou Grant! There's more. Dick
Wolf, the man responsible for ``Law &AMP; Order,'' is producing a drama
series about a crusading newspaperman. Titled ``Deadline,'' it
features the bulldoggish Oliver Platt as Wallace Benton, a
columnist who lives life large and makes headlines on and off the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Benton could investigate the real reason behind the
disappearance of ``Freaks and Geeks,'' another NBC cancelee. And
maybe Michael Richards could help him out. Richards, a three-time
Emmy winner as Kramer on ``Seinfeld,'' returns to NBC in his own
comedy as an off-kilter private detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Michael Richards Show'' _ when in doubt, name it after the
star _ will lead off a Tuesday night slate that also features
``Frasier,'' back from a two-year tour of duty as linchpin of NBC's
faltering Thursday-comedy quartet. (``Will &AMP; Grace'' will move to
the Thursday-at-9 slot, along with ``Just Shoot Me'' at 9:30.)
</P>
<P>
   Further surgery on the Thursday lineup was avoided, to no one's
great surprise, when NBC and Warner Bros. Television caved last
weekend and agreed to give each cast member of ``Friends'' as much
money per season ($16.5 million) as it takes TV critics to make in
three or four. Hundred.
</P>
<P>
   In all, NBC unveiled four new comedies and three new dramas for
the fall. It also will introduce ``XFL Football'' on Saturday
nights, beginning in February. The XFL is a joint venture of NBC
and the World Wrestling Federation, proving that peacocks can get
down and dirty when they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a summary of NBC's fall entries. Other networks follow
suit later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Michael Richards Show. Richards plays an offbeat private eye
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   DAG. David Alan Grier (``In Living Color'') is back as a Secret
Service agent demoted to guarding the first lady (Delta Burke).
</P>
<P>
   Tucker. A teenager (Eli Marienthal) and his divorced mom (Noelle
Beck) move in with her perfectionist sister (Katey Sagal) and
loutish son (Nathan Lawrence).
</P>
<P>
   The Steven Weber Show. The former ``Wings'' star plays a
fast-track ad executive unlucky in love because of a hex placed on
him by a jilted blind date.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline. From Dick Wolf, this series has Oliver Platt playing a
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist ``who lives his life in boldface
type.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans. Aaron Spelling's latest potboiler about rich white
people, about a young fighter pilot (Casper Van Dien) who returns
home to Beverly Hills to discover that his rich and filthy family
is in turmoil. Also starring Victoria Principal, Perry King and
Yasmine Bleeth.
</P>
<P>
   Ed. Tom Cavanagh (``Providence'') plays a New York lawyer who
moves back to the Midwest, hoping to kindle a relationship with a
former classmate _ the most popular girl in school _ who barely
knows he exists.

<P>
   A well-scrubbed child in striped pajamas snuggles against a soft
shoulder and listens attentively: It's time for the bedtime story.
</P>
<P>
   This charming nightly ritual is deceptively simple, for its true
significance runs deep and wide. The routine eases the child
through a sometimes difficult transition into sleep, while the book
itself can teach a dozen important lessons from tolerance, sharing,
and the importance of having a friend, to proper grammar and usage,
or factual information about dinosaurs, bulldozers, or how to
handle feelings about a new baby sister.
</P>
<P>
   This intimate bedtime tradition is one of the most valuable
gifts that you, as a loving parent, can share with your child.
Research shows that children who are read to are more likely to
become fluent readers themselves and often do better at school.
Teaching a child to love books opens his mind and eyes to all the
vast possibilities of the world as well as to his own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Families who go beyond reading aloud at bedtime to build reading
customs into other aspects of their lives will strengthen both the
bond between parent and child as well as the bond between the child
and books. Don't forgo ``The Velveteen Rabbit'' or ``Goodnight
Moon,'' or whatever your child's favorite story might be, as part
of a bedtime routine. But think about adding some of the reading
rituals described which will kindle a lifetime love of books.
</P>
<P>
   1. Start library visits in infancy. Take, out books weekly or
biweekly. To build anticipation for a toddler, tape a ``Library
List'' to the fridge, and whenever your child gets interested in a
particular topic such as insects or weather or mermaids, add that
topic to the list. Attend storytime or any other special reading
hours at your local library.
</P>
<P>
   2. Celebrate your favorite authors. On January 18th each year,
we throw a ``Pooh party'' to honor the birthday of A. A. Milne,
author of the popular ``Winnie the Pooh'' series of books. My
5-year-old son and I bake honey cookies and have a tea party on the
floor with his stuffed Piglet and Pooh, and read a Pooh story
aloud. On March 2nd, the birthday of Dr. Seuss, we make green eggs
and ham. June 10th is author Maurice Sendak's birthday: Try
dressing up like the ``wild things'' in Sendak's popular book and
act out the adventures.
</P>
<P>
   3. Create book-giving rituals. In one family I know, the kids
find a new book under their pillows every Friday night. Another
friend gives each of her three daughters a complete set of Laura
Ingalls Wilder's ``Little House on the Prairie'' series on her
ninth birthday. We always bring along two or three new ``trip
books'' like ``Charlotte's Web'' when traveling by air or car. A
trip is an ideal time to introduce chapter books to preschoolers.
And bringing several favorite picture or lift-the-flap books to a
restaurant makes it possible for a squirmy toddler to stay calmer
longer.
</P>
<P>
   4. Dramatize the reading experience. The Siegal family of
Alexandria, Va., always reads by flashlight while on vacation,
often snuggling together on the beach or sitting on the dock at
night. Try reading a play aloud with family members ``acting''
different roles.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create and construct books together. Danielle Nelson of
Hopewell, N.J., researched major holidays on the Internet with her
sons. Then they put together the information and images they had
downloaded, jazzed up with crayons and glitter, to tell the story
of each holiday. Or have your child dictate a story she makes up.
Your job: Write it down on sheets of paper stapled together. Then
read it back to her.
</P>
<P>
   6. Read aloud at some meals. I'm convinced this is why my son
eats far more broccoli than the average 5-year-old: If he stops
eating, I gently chide him, ``You stop, I stop.'' Because he can't
wait to hear what happens to Mr. Popper's penguins, or the latest
adventure of Harry Potter, he resumes eating. Meals are also a
great time to teach conversation, so we limit reading aloud to
occasional meals.
</P>
<P>
   7. Expand reading material. Kids are naturally drawn to reading
material that interests them due to its subject matter. Lots of
kids have a greater incentive to read the phonics-based text,
especially the names of characters they liked, on Pokemon cards.
Encourage your budding baseball players to learn about their
favorite superstars by buying baseball cards and reading them
together. You may just end up spending the rest of the afternoon
discussing team trivia. Give your grade-schooler a subscription to
a magazine such as ``chickaDEE'' (ages 5 to 8) or ``National
Geographic World'' (ages 8 to 13). The eagerly anticipated arrival
of the magazine in the mail becomes a monthly event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Memorize poems. Kids love rhymes from the time they hear
their first Mother Goose. As they grow, why not share some of the
more sophisticated stuff? During National Poetry Month each April,
read poems at snacktime or bedtime. Or write a family poem about a
recent trip together (you can always tell them it's rap).
</P>
<P>
   9. Start a book group with your kids. Preteen girls and mothers
can form reading groups with other mothers and daughters. This
could also work for fathers and sons or several families joining
together. Read and discuss a child-oriented chapter book monthly
after a potluck supper. Make sure the kids have an equal voice in
book selection and, if possible, in running the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   10. Add books to holiday celebrations. My family's favorite is a
literary countdown calendar: Gift wrap every book with a Christmas
theme, then tape numbers on the front from 1 to 24. Each night
after dinner beginning on December 1st, let your children open one
book and read it together. A friend of mine wraps half in red and
half in green, so her daughters can take turns. At our house,
number 24 is always ``The Night Before Christmas.'' A literary
countdown also works well for marking the eight days of Hanukkah
with eight books.
</P>
<P>
   11. Visit bookstores regularly. The Voigt family of Clarence,
N.Y., takes their two sons to a favorite bookstore once a month and
each child gets to choose one book to buy or read in the store.
Many bookstores with children's sections offer weekly readings,
puppet shows, or visits from book characters like Arthur or The Cat
in the Hat. Kids can meet writers and illustrators at book
signings, or try a craft activity like making puppets and putting
on a show.
</P>
<P>
   12. Live what you read. Young children especially love to act
out stories, and if parents eagerly participate, books will become
much more vital to kids. Read ``Spot Bakes a Cake'' to your 2- or
3-year-old and then bake together. Your child might absorb a lesson
on kindness, sharing, or tolerating differences from Rosemary
Wells' ``Yoko'' or Kevin Henkes' ``Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse''
that she'd be less likely to accept from a parent-initiated
discussion. After reading about a squirrel family that holds hands
before eating a Thanksgiving feast in the hollow of a tree, my son
asked why we couldn't hold hands around the table, too. Now we do.
</P>

 FEEL-GOOD OXYGEN FACIALS MAY OR MAY NOT KEEP SKIN YOUNG  ART ADV:
(Photos of woman receiving oxygen facial available in JPEG format

<P>
   Cathy Bucalo, 49, says that after her face lift, oxygen facials
restored moisture and helped her skin heal. ``It's very relaxing,''
she says. ``I think it's a combination of the facial and the way I
feel when I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, facials have been part of Bucalo's
cosmetic routine. ``I see the most results in my cheekbone area.
I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen enthusiasts claim there's something about an extra dose
of oxygen that's revitalizing. Cosmetic specialists say it's good
for the skin, and that hydrogen peroxide cream helps water and
oxygen penetrate the skin better. But not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no scientific evidence to support the belief that
oxygen facials do anything for the skin,'' says Dr. Mitchel Goldman
of Dermatology Associates in San Diego. ``Oxygen is actually toxic
to skin cells. That's why most cosmetics contain antioxidants,
including vitamins C, A and E.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen reacts easily with other substances and causes metals to
rust. Hemoglobin in the blood contains iron that oxidizes or
``rusts'' in order to combine with oxygen in the lungs and carry it
to all the body's cells. There, oxygen oxidizes food to yield
energy.
</P>
<P>
   But oxidation of the body's own cells speeds aging. It's also
linked to heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That's why antioxidants, like vitamins C, A and E, found
abundantly in fruits and vegetables, have become so popular. They
destroy harmful molecules called free radicals that are produced by
oxidation. Free radicals disrupt the DNA inside cells and advance
aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin does better in a nonoxygen environment,'' says
Goldman. ``That's one of the reasons why I advise my patients to
use antioxidant creams for their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmeticians have a different take on the role that oxygen plays
in skin care.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the oxygen gets into the skin, the cell regeneration
speeds up,'' says Joyce Carboni, whose Skinsational Spa in
Carlsbad, Calif., specializes in oxygen facials. ``We apply
hydrogen peroxide cream to the face to help oxygen penetrate the
skin and get into the cells.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The relaxation that you get when you spend time giving
yourself a facial is absolutely incredible,'' says Bucalo. ``It's
about what's next, and what's new. I'm available and willing to try
anything these ladies have in mind for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxygen is extremely hydrating and healing to the skin. We've
seen the results,'' adds Carboni.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen facial begins with cleansing. The client receives a
mild facial scrub with jojoba beads or an enzyme peel. A thin film
of 2 percent hydrogen peroxide cream is then applied. A plastic
wrap or facial steamer may be used for the next 10 minutes. Then a
mask containing hydrogen peroxide is placed over the skin for
another 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the facial, a hydrogen peroxide finishing cream is
gently massaged into the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about a facial is the therapeutic message,''
says Goldman. ``It can perhaps promote lymphatic drainage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmeticians say the skin absorbs oxygen like a sponge, but
medical opinion says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a limit to how much oxygen your body can absorb,''
says Dr. John C. Nelson, of the American Medical Association. ``The
oxygen carrying capacity of the blood cannot be increased, except
by increasing the number of red cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Red cells contain hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the
lungs and deliver it to the body's cells as needed. Nelson says
only people suffering from heart or respiratory diseases benefit
from extra oxygen. Regarding oxygen facials or oxygen-infused
beverages he says, ``To the extent that these are used as social or
entertainment types of activities, I think there's no detriment.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery patients commonly receive 30 percent oxygen during and
after surgery (air is only 21 percent oxygen) because the lungs
don't work as well under anesthesia. Studies have shown that
boosting the oxygen helps reduce infection and nausea in
post-surgery patients.
</P>
<P>
   White blood cells called ``neutrophils'' use oxygen to kill
germs. The correct amount of oxygen in the body's tissues is good
for health, but doctors say there's a limit.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say inhaling oxygen recreationally probably
won't have any beneficial effect, and they warn that oxygen at high
levels can be toxic. However, no evidence shows that oxygen at the
low levels used in bars or facials can be dangerous to a normal
person's health.

&HT;     BRITAIN'S ROWDY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ From a distance, the British parliamentary system looks
orderly and serene in comparison to our own messy political
process.
</P>
<P>
   But up close here in London, it is clear that the politicians
are as adept at hurling insults and the voters as irritatingly
rebellious as our own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a left-wing rascal nicknamed Red Ken, cast out of
the Labor Party for being politically incorrect, was overwhelmingly
elected mayor of London earlier this month despite the impassioned
opposition of Prime Minister Tony Blair. To make matters worse,
Blair's party simultaneously lost more than 500 local council seats
in nationwide elections, a thumping mid-term triumph for the rival
Conservatives and Blair's biggest electoral setback since coming to
power three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teflon Tony'' has been riding high in the polls but things may
be changing. The imminent arrival of the first baby in 150 years
born to a British prime minister and his wife _ both in their 40's
_ is bound to help his image. But it may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The new elected post of London mayor now occupied by Ken
Livingstone was created at Blair's insistence to extend his own
influence and generate public interest in city politics. Now Blair
must deal with a sworn enemy rather than the compliant friend he
had hoped to install.
</P>
<P>
   There was no public reconciliation between the two men, who were
even more reluctant than our famously independent Sen. John McCain
to bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to rattle their chains,'' Livingstone gloated. He
also noted slyly that if his victory is replicated nationally in a
general election, expected to be called next spring, Blair would
lose his majority and be out of work.
</P>
<P>
   One of Livingstone's closest advisers, Kumar Murshid, promptly
dramatized the coming storm by declaring that Prince Philip, the
husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is ``an unreconstructed racist'' and
by calling for the abolition of the monarchy. ``Prince Philip is a
waste of time. ... He gives the image of being very arrogant and
also fairly ignorant,'' Murshid said. Livingstone had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, trying to make the best of a very bad deal, professed to
believe that the elections were not a rejection of Labor policies
but a reflection of low turnout and voter indifference. His theory
is that there's nothing wrong with Labor's centrist message, it's
just not getting across at the moment. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Blair and President Clinton, amiable baby boomers who espouse
similar middle-road policies, often confer and are often compared
(although unlike Clinton, Blair has a happy, rumor-free marriage).
They echo each other's themes, remain relentlessly upbeat in the
face of disaster, prefer pragmatic ideas to ideology and do their
darndest to identify with ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes they are both too clever by half. Blair's cute
maneuvers to make Livingstone a political leper backfired. He was
too obvious, too self-serving against a cheeky underdog touring the
city in a purple bus, a British version of McCain's ``Straight Talk
Express.''
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat, however, Blair picked himself up off the mat
as Clinton always does and marched out dutifully to the House of
Commons to endure the weekly ritual of answering hostile questions
from the opposition Conservatives, also known as the Tories.
</P>
<P>
   Although this regular half-hour performance is usually
accompanied by shouts, boos, foot-stamping and other rude
expressions from legislators, it is an extremely useful tool of
government. We could do worse.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Blair defend himself from the Parliament press gallery
was a real treat for this American journalist. This was politics at
its rowdy best, bright minds locked in verbal combat, temper
tantrums barely controlled, no cunning obfuscations tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders naturally ragged Blair about the London
mayoral debacle. ``I can't see many advantages to the situation but
one is that I'm not responsible for the new mayor's actions,''
Blair said wryly to a cacophony of unintelligible, competing noises

<P>
   The prime minister and Tory leader William Hague argued about
whose policies would protect the most jobs, which featured British
specifics but sounded just like the fights in Washington over
corporate mega-mergers and the complications of a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Blair accused Hague of having ``a not a single constructive
solution to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague countered, ``Since no senior member of the government has
ever worked in a business, why don't they listen to some people who
do?''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange produced additional hoots.
</P>
<P>
   Our traditions do not provide for such direct confrontations in
public between the leaders of the executive and legislative
branches, but perhaps it should. It clears the air. Open insults
are better than sneaky back-stabbing. And more fun for the public
as well.

   SCOTUS-WOMEN (Washington) _ Declaring that ``the Constitution
requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is
truly local,'' the Supreme Court Monday invalidated a six-year-old
law that permitted victims of rape, domestic violence and other
crimes ``motivated by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal
court. The 5-4 decision striking down the civil remedy provision of
the Violence Against Women Act was the latest, one of the most
sweeping, but almost certainly not the last application of the
court's newly restrictive view of congressional power and of the
degree of deference that Congress is owed by federal courts. By
Linda Greenhouse.

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ For the first time in four
years, Israeli and Palestinian troops engaged in hours of gun
battles in the West Bank Monday as Israeli forces suppressed
Palestinian demonstrations by shooting tear gas, rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition into stone-throwing crowds. Three
Palestinians were killed _ two police officers and a teen-ager _
and 350 were injured, according to Palestinian officials. Six
Israeli soldiers were injured, according to Israeli officials.
Against this violent backdrop, Prime Minister Ehud Barak won
Parliament's approval to transfer full control of three Palestinian

have been destroyed by pollution. Though China has enacted strict

SHOPPING FOR CANDIDATES? CHECK THEIR GIFT REGISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   by DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been sitting here trying to make up my mind about what to
buy as a wedding gift for Newt Gingrich and his bride-to-be,
Callista Bisek. I'm having a hard time choosing between the Ralph
Lauren tub mat ($24.99) and the Waterford ice bucket ($198).
</P>
<P>
   They're planning to get married in August, now that his divorce
from Marianne is final. Newt and Callie, you'll recall, were once
participants in the most secretive adulterous relationship in
politics _ behind Bill and Monica, of course, and apparently just
ahead of Rudolph Giuliani and his paramour.
</P>
<P>
   Newt's new career in speechifying seems to be going quite
nicely. The Washington Post reports that he and his betrothed are
getting ready to close a deal on a $1 million house outside the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Post recently found not one but two gift registries on the
Internet for the charming couple. Turns out they've compiled a wish
list containing items worth more than _ ooh, how festive _ $14,000
at Macy's and Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   I don't expect to be invited to the shindig, but I couldn't help
but sneak a peek at the gift possibilities. You can, too. (The
Macy's list was the only one still online when I checked). I think
I'll call dibs on the Ralph Lauren tub mat, but if you want to get
them the same thing, go right ahead. They asked for four.
</P>
<P>
   I read recently that some Americans are starting to feel
nostalgic for the Clinton era, even before it's over. I'm not among
them. I voted for the man twice, but I'm fairly agreeable to
letting him go. (Don't let the Oval Office door hit you on the way
out, Bubba.)
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I understand the wistfulness, though. Looking back, it
does seem like there was something quaint and predictable about the
days when Bill and Newt ran amok in Washington. As I ponder the
next four years, I find myself longing for the angry
finger-wagging, baldfaced lies and smarmy apologies.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the shakedowns. Bill and Newt were probably the
most adept in the nation's history at hugging corporate CEOs and
walking away with their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   They seem positively harmless, though, compared to the abandon
with which their successors are soliciting funds.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1999 through April of this year, according to the
watchdog group Common Cause, the Republican and Democratic parties
drummed up $160.5 million in soft money donations, the type of
fund-raising that corporations and politicians use to bypass
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   That's twice the amount raised during the first 15 months of the
1996 election cycle, according to The New York Times. Before this
presidential campaign is over, the parties are expected to raise a
whopping half-billion dollars in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news, though. The Times reports that 31 major
corporations have quietly chosen, at least for now, to spurn the
bridal registries set up by Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   These companies, without fanfare, are joining others _ General
Motors, Monsanto, Time Warner, to name a few _ in calling a halt to
soft-money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that there are more and more companies asking
themselves if this is really worth it,'' says Charles E.M. Kolb,
president of the Committee for Economic Development, a group of
CEOs pushing for campaign finance reform. ``What's just as
interesting, though, is the fact that companies are scared to tell
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a prominent Washington lawyer and lobbyist, says
clients are telling him enough's enough. ``Both political parties
have gotten so excessive in trying to beat the other in the
soft-money hunt,'' he says. ``I'm part of the problem, and I've
never seen such disgust with the practice in all my years here. It
has reached critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that doesn't explain the half-billion dollars on its
way to Al Gore, George W. Bush and their comrades in (open) arms.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporations, it appears, still feel a need to show they
care but are having a difficult time finding a more appropriate
gift.
</P>
<P>
   May I suggest the Ralph Lauren tub mat, at a relatively modest
$24.99? I have a feeling everyone involved could use a really good
scrubbing. If that doesn't work, we can always toss them a bucket
of ice.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds will develop across the Southwest Tuesday,
exacerbating problems associated with containing wildfires in New
Mexico. The catalyst for increasing winds will be a potent
upper-level low pressure system over the Great Basin. Winds from
the west-southwest will average 25 to 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of potent thunderstorms will rumble across parts of
the southern Plains early Tuesday as winds in a narrow corridor
2,000 feet above the ground rapidly transport moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico into eastern Kansas. Storms will gradually weaken as
they move southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will develop in
southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado Tuesday afternoon, but
there will be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms Tuesday evening and
night over parts of South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a clear and cold start with scattered frost, sunshine will
raise temperatures into the 50s and lower 60s throughout the
interior Northeast Tuesday. Clouds will dim the sunshine in the
afternoon as high-level moisture arrives from the west. It will be
a bit milder in the central Appalachians, where readings will
approach 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAD START
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the beginning of hurricane season over the
tropical eastern Pacific. (Atlantic hurricane season begins June
1.) The May 15 start pays homage to an early pool of warm water
that traditionally develops off the western coast of Mexico south
of Baja, Calif. The catalysts for tropical storms are easterly
waves and systems of thunderstorms over the mountains of Mexico.
Easterly waves are disturbances that move westward over the
tropics, while systems of mountain thunderstorms can develop into a
tropical storm once they move over warm water. &QL;

2 IN CONGRESS STALL BILL TO IMPLEMENT TREATY ON ADOPTION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption
professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent
US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve
the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide,
and curtail corruption in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the American adoption community and sources on
Capitol Hill said the two Republicans _ Senator Sam Brownback of
Kansas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey _ are the sole
roadblocks to passage of legislation implementing the treaty,
called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. It has
already been approved by 40 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback last week used a maneuver called a ``hold'' to stall
consideration of the measure. He said his opposition to the
implementing legislation stems largely from the advice of Laura
Cecere, the operator of a Cambridge, Mass. adoption service who
helped him adopt a daughter from China last December.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback maintained in an interview that the bill would raise
adoption costs and impose standards that could drive small firms
like Cecere's out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not respond to requests for an interview. But,
according to people in and out of Washington who have helped to
draft the implementing legislation, he is holding out mainly
because he wants to include language precluding homosexuals and
other Americans with ``promiscuous lifestyles'' from adopting.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of
international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in
adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high. Last year,
16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double
the number of just 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing time for the institution,'' said Madelyn
Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption
Institute in New York. ``I think that's one reason the time is
right for this treaty now and why it's so very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brownback's ``hold'' were lifted, both he and Smith have
indicated a willingness to impede passage of the legislation as
currently written by introducing potentially fractious amendments
and using other parliamentary maneuvers that could tie up the House
and Senate at a time when most members are anxious to complete
their business as quickly as possible so they can go home to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership doesn't want a protracted, potentially divisive
floor fight, so a single, determined congressman can block the
entire bill,'' said Fred Greenman, the legal adviser to the
American Adoption Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over bringing the bill to the floor of Congress _ it
has already been approved by pertinent committees in both houses _
is most striking because the measure enjoys the backing of an
unusually wide array of ideological factions on Capitol Hill and in
the adoption world.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delicate negotiations, the end product won the
support of politicians ranging from Senator Jesse Helms, the
conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee who is its primary sponsor, to Representative William D.
Delahunt, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who has been
instrumental in putting together the broad congressional coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella
organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption
attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing
adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these activists, like the American Adoption Congress and
the National Council for Adoption, vehemently disagree on nearly
every other topic relating to adoption practices but have decided
to put aside their lingering differences about some of the treaty's
details because they view its overall purpose as so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic document that will protect needy kids and
increase the chances for them to be adopted. Not passing it would
be a major embarrassment for the United States and an enormous
human-rights setback for the children,'' said Maureen Hogan,
president of Adopt America Advocates, which finds homes for
special-needs children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993. Since then, 29
nations have ratified the treaty and 11 others have accepted it by
a process called accession. The United States is among 11 original
signatories to the pact that have not ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, only the Senate can approve a treaty, but both
chambers must approve legislation spelling out how it will be
implemented. The fight in Congress is over that legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would require firms operating abroad to radically
alter some of their practices, which currently receive little
regulation or monitoring and which have always been the nearly
exclusive purview of state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for each member nation to create a ``central
authority'' _ meaning a significant federal role _ to deal with
issues that include breaking down procedural and legal barriers
among participants, preventing practitioners from exploiting birth
parents or making improper financial gains, and upgrading the
conditions and protecting the rights of institutionalized children.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming they adhered to the letter of the treaty, participants
would be obliged to toughen some of their laws and regulations.
Perhaps most significantly, the central authorities would have to
certify agencies that want to operate in other Hague treaty
nations, and would be required to set rigorous standards by which
those agencies would be legally bound to abide.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the treaty's implementation would lead to
unprecedented changes for agencies, lawyers, and facilitators who
now function with minimal and often-haphazard rules, particularly
abroad. Adoption-reform organizations say this climate invites
illegalities and dubious practices, ranging from bribery and
coercion of birth parents to obtain their babies, to the
establishment of adoption businesses by people who have little or
no experience but want to cash in on the thousands of American
individuals and couples who each pay tens of thousands of dollars
for overseas adoptions annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once the United States passes this, it will make a
real difference,'' said Delahunt. While he and other proponents
emphasized that they did not expect extensive improvements
overnight, they asserted that the treaty is an essential step
toward cleaning up existing abuses, enhancing adoption's image, and
leading more Americans to adopt as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80
percent of the world's adoptees, US ratification also would serve
as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not
under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their
treatment of children.
</P>
<P>
   People on all sides of the congressional debate stressed they
agreed with the goals Delahunt outlined and said they believed
reforms of the type envisioned in the Hague Convention will go a
long way toward achieving them. Sources familiar with Smith's views
said he feels strongly about promoting ``family values'' at the
same time, however, and Brownback insisted he only wants to ensure
that the implementing legislation doesn't cause harm even as it
attempts to do good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful we can get this through,'' the senator said from
his home in Kansas Friday, ``but I have a fundamental concern that,
without some fixing, this could actually reduce the number of
international adoptions rather than grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said that could happen largely because an American
central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current
international adoption process. The resulting procedures and
regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could
drive some prospective parents out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   He added that small agencies, in particular, would find it
administratively difficult and expensive to adhere to rule-changes,
and therefore could be forced out of business. The implementing
legislation, in response to concerns from Cecere, does give small
firms such as hers an additional two years to comply with any new
mandates, but Brownback said that would not be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he favors making the central authority in this
country a body that would maintain a registry of adoption
practitioners, but would not certify them or establish rules. It's
unclear whether that would comply with the treaty itself.

POWERFUL NEW PEARL JAM ALBUM OUT TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Pearl Jam song ``Rival'' opens with the menacing sounds
of a growling dog. ``Thin Air'' drips melancholy like a Roy Orbison
tear-jerker. And ``Breakerfall'' rages with the anguish and
desperation of an empty heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a girl on a ledge, she's got nowhere to turn/ 'Cause
all the love that she had was just wood that she burned,'' Eddie
Vedder sings in the angry, searing rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam's new album, ``Binaural,'' is due in stores Tuesday on
Epic Records. Powerful and atmospheric, it reflects the Seattle
band's collaboration with producer, engineer and musician Tchad
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The album, the band's sixth, comes out at a time when Pearl Jam
is in a good space, guitarist Stone Gossard said in a phone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's going fine. We've having a lot of fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The band is about to hit the road. It will begin a 27-date
European tour May 23 in Lisbon, Portugal, followed by a U.S. tour
beginning Aug. 3 in Virginia Beach, Va. Pearl Jam performed warmup
shows last week in Bellingham and Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pearl Jam feuded with Ticketmaster in the mid-'90s over
ticket service charges, the band will sell most of the tickets
through Ticketmaster and the remainder through local, independent
agents.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour gets under way, Pearl Jam will celebrate its 10th
anniversary as a band. The group's first album, ``Ten,'' catapulted
the band to international fame in the early '90s, a time when
grunge turned Seattle into a rock mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real milestone,'' Gossard said. ``And when we start
this tour, we will have had the same drummer for two tours in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron is the latest in a
string of Pearl Jam drummers, including Jack Irons, Dave Abbruzzese
and Dave Krusen. Cameron _ whose wife, April Cameron, played viola
on the new album _ replaced Irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt has been making records with us and touring with us, but
I don't know whether he's officially a member or not,'' Gossard
said. ``It's always been a little vague to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wife and a family and he's got his own musical
projects that he puts a lot of energy into. Those are all big
priorities in his life. But as long as he wants to play with us,
we'd love to have him. He's such a great musician and a great
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossard gave credit to producer Blake for the new album's
unusual title and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who has worked with Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt
and Elvis Costello, is a member of Latin Playboys, the Los Lobos
side band featuring David Hidalgo, Louie Perez and Mitchell Froom.
The Playboys' 1999 album, ``Dose,'' is intense and surreal,
embellished with hi- and lo-fi sound effects and experimental
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sonics of his records and the atmosphere he creates are
pretty unique,''Gossard said. ``Tchad mixed a lot of songs on Tom
Waits' `Bone Machine.' Some of it was really industrial sounding,
but organic at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patient and creative, Blake was an asset in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who loves working on stuff because he
likes the way it sounds and not because he thinks it's going to be
a hit,'' he said. ``He's just very in tune with trying to be
creative in the studio and being patient with that process. He's a
great engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album got its title from the binaural microphone that
Blake brought into the studio. Normally used in acoustic laboratory
environments for testing and studying the nuances of human hearing,
the binaural mike resembles a plastic human head with microphones
where the ears would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a binaural mike, you basically set it out there in front
of you and it's a stereo recording device that simulates what
things would sound like in your head,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked up the word `binaural,' it meant to listen with
both ears. So it seemed like a fitting title for the album.''
</P>
<P>
   The binaural microphone is what gives the song ``Soon Forget''
its razor-sharp presence. Vedder, who wrote the song, accompanies
himself on ukelele on the tender, humorous track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette,'' Vedder
sings. ``Thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic.
... He's living a day he'll soon forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful little song, sentimental and fun at the same
time,'' Gossard said. ``I think it was something that everyone in
the band immediately responded to. As soon as we heard him play it,
we were like, `Oh, that's gotta go on the record.' I think Ed was
just joking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Recorded at Gossard's Studio Litho in Seattle, ``Binaural'' took
about eight months to write and record. It features music and
lyrics by Pearl Jam core members Gossard, Vedder, bassist Mike
McCready and bassist Jeff Ament, as well as drummer Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked over a longer period of time than we normally do,
but we weren't super-rigorous about it,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd work for a couple of weeks, then take a month or two off,
then come back and work for a couple more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossard wrote the music and lyrics for three songs, ``Rival,''
``Thin Air'' and ``Of the Girl,'' a sweet, simple love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work all different ways,'' Gossard said of his songwriting.
``You have a riff and you just start playing it and then you start
humming something and you start filling in words. That's how I do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever that mood is, you try to explore it and try to be as
unself-conscious about it as you can possibly be. Sometimes that
means singing the same riff for weeks and weeks until all of a
sudden the right words pop into your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivals'' (which opens with the growling of Blake's dog,
Dakota) is a vengeful, ominous song that begins with the words,
``All my rivals will see what I have in store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came up with the riff and we played with that for a
while,'' Gossard said. ``I kind of saw it as a cartoon exploration
of competition and paranoia and people's perspective on who's out
to get them. I thought of relating that to how nations deal with
each other and sort of push each other around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then while we were working on the album the whole
Columbine High School tragedy happened and it started reflecting
some of that stuff, too. So it just kind of has a weird mishmash of
influences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Binaural'' follows the release of last year's ``Live on Two
Legs'' and 1998's ``Yield.'' The single ``Nothing As It Seems'' was
released in April and is at No. 4 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock
chart.
</P>
<P>
   The original May 23 release date for ``Binaural'' _ the CD cover
features a Hubbell Telescope color photo of the Hourglass Nebula
encircling a dying star 8,000 light years from Earth _ was moved up
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, if you have the record done and it's
ready to get out, you might as well put it out as soon as
possible,'' Gossard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the advance copies go out, people will start to get
the record and if it ends up online, there may be a situation where
people are getting it before it goes on sale.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The space station is falling. As it orbits Earth, even at a
height of 210 miles, the nascent International Space Station
brushes against wisps of air, causing it gradually to lose speed
and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The sun, as it approaches the height of its 11-year sunspot
cycle, churns in a more unruly roil, throwing out more high-energy
radiation that puffs out Earth's outer atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The station falls faster.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the space station has been dropping 1.5 to 2
miles a week. At that pace, its orbit would dip below 200 miles by
the time the next piece of the station, the Zvezda service module,
is launched in July.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred miles is still a safe altitude, but any further
delay of Zvezda, already two and a half years late, could pose a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things won't really get precarious until the end of August,''
said Paul S. Hill, the space station's flight director. ``It'd be
September before you'd hear loud noises and see a big splash.''
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, Hill said, flight controllers could fire the
station's rockets to raise the orbit. But the station's limited
propellant is needed to dock the station to Zvezda, and until
Zvezda arrives, there is no way to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that conundrum entirely is one reason the space shuttle
Atlantis is now on the launching pad. During an 11-day mission,
which is to begin Thursday morning, Atlantis is to nudge the space
station upward by 20 to 25 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Atlantis was to fly a few weeks after Zvezda joined
the two components already in orbit. But after the Russians put off
Zvezda's launching until July, NASA decided in February to split
the original shuttle mission in two.
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised schedule, Atlantis will bring up more than a
ton of supplies now _ including fans, air filters and replacements
for failing batteries _ and then revisit the station with more
supplies about five weeks after the launching of Zvezda.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, these flights will break the logjam that has
stalled work on the $60 billion project. ``I think we are
positioned to have a very big year,'' said W. Michael Hawes, NASA's
chief engineer for the space station. ``I think we're in a position
to make very good, rapid progress, as soon as we get the service
module in July.''
</P>
<P>
   The station's first full-time occupants are to arrive at the end
of October. For now, NASA wants to make sure that what is already
up stays up in working condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary reason is to do maintenance work on the station,''
James Hartsfield, a spokesman at NASA's Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said of this month's trip. ``The re-boost is a close
second.''
</P>
<P>
   When it split the mission in two, NASA also split the crew,
reassigning three members to the later flight. The crew for the
first mission includes James D. Halsell Jr., the commander; Dr.
Scott J. Horowitz, the pilot, and Dr. Mary Ellen Weber and Jeffrey
N. Williams, the mission specialists, who have been training
together more than a year. Joining them will be two American
astronauts, James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms, and a Russian
astronaut, Yuri V. Usachev, who had been training in Moscow to be
the station's second crew.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a shuttle crew trains six months to a year for a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The short-notice shuttle crew shuffling is unusual, but NASA
says the newcomers should have no trouble with their new duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were extremely familiar with all of the systems of the
space station,'' said Rob Navias, a Johnson Space Center spokesman.
Adding the three to the current mission ``made perfect sense from
our standpoint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, which was postponed from last month by bad weather,
includes a six-and-a-half hour spacewalk to install a crane and
other equipment on the outside of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   On the mission's eighth day, after all of the cargo has been
unloaded to the station, the shuttle will use its leftover
propellant to raise the station to a higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Then the falling begins again.
</P>
<P>
   At the altitude of the space station, the thin upper atmosphere
is a better vacuum than what can be produced in the best vacuum
chambers on the ground _ but it is not empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In space there are still some particles that impact the
spacecraft and cause drag,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of particles rises and falls with the sun's sunspot
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun is at its quietest, each cubic inch of space 200
miles above the ground still contains about five billion molecules,
mostly atoms of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun is near the height of its solar activity, intense
magnetic fields erupt out of its surface that heat gases in the
sun's atmosphere to millions of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have things at two million degrees,'' said Dr.
Raymond G. Roble, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Space and Environmental Center in
Boulder, Colo., ``they give off X-rays.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a small fraction of the sun's light is emitted as X-rays,
but the intensity of X-rays at solar maximum can be up to 10 times
as great as at solar minimum. (At visible wavelengths, the sun is
only an imperceptible fraction of 1 percent brighter.)
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-three million miles away, some of those X-rays, as well
as photons of short-wavelength ultraviolet light, slam into
molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere, heating them up.
</P>
<P>
   At solar minimum, the temperature of the atmosphere 200 miles up
is 600 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At solar maximum, temperatures
rise to more than 1,800 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way a hot air balloon rises upward, ``that extra
heating causes the atmosphere to expand outward,'' Roble said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the density of the atmosphere is now nearly 10
times as great as when the sun is at solar minimum. The denser
atmosphere increases the drag on the station, and the station falls
faster.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of falling peaked at more than two miles a week, but it
has since slowed down again as solar activity entered a temporary
lull. The peak is expected in the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The falling would never have been a concern at all, except for
the slipping launching date of the Zvezda service module.
</P>
<P>
   The 42,000-pound Zvezda, which is to provide living quarters,
propulsion and flight control and some laboratory space, was to
have been launched five months after the first two segments, the
Russian-built Zarya and the American-built Unity modules, were
launched in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda, which means ``star'' in Russian, was first delayed by a
lack of Russian financing. Then two Russian Proton rockets, the
type that is to lift Zvezda into orbit, exploded and crashed,
causing further delays.
</P>
<P>
   But according to some analysts, the rocket failures were a
blessing, giving both the United States and Russia more time to
test space station components on the ground instead of rushing them
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's launch schedule was a game of space chicken, with
both sides roaring down the road, hoping the other would blink
first,'' said James E. Oberg of Houston, a former NASA engineer who
is an expert on the Russian space program. ``There was divine
intervention. Both sides were saved by a Russian rocket failure,
which gave the Russians the excuse everyone was hoping for.''  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the two crashes, the Russians have successfully launched
three Protons with a fourth scheduled in June before the Zvezda
launching, which is now scheduled for sometime between July 8 and
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the July launch date is much more realistic than
anything we've had before,'' said Rep. Dave Weldon, a Florida
Republican who has been critical of Russian involvement in the
space station project. ``But there's also the track record of delay
upon delay upon delay.''
</P>
<P>
   A successful launching of Zvezda would be followed in September
by the first piece of the truss that would be the backbone of the
space station. The first three-member crew is scheduled to arrive
in late October via a Russian Soyuz rocket. The first solar panels
are to go up in November, and the American-built Destiny laboratory
module is scheduled for launching in mid-January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, the U.S. elements are looking in pretty good
shape, and I think we'll be able to meet our launch schedule after
the service module,'' Hawes said.
</P>
<P>
   Other schedule snags may still arise. Because Russia is keeping
its aging Mir space station, there may not be enough rockets to
ferry supplies and crews to both over the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also been building a substitute module for
Zvezda in case the Russians run into further delays. In February,
NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, announced that if Russia
did not launch Zvezda by early August, NASA would instead send up
its interim control module at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But that $200 million module will not be ready by Goldin's
December date. Part of the module's ground-to-station communication
system has failed and needs to be replaced. ``We're probably a good
seven weeks off the December schedule,'' Hawes said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the interim control module also uses a different docking
mechanism than Zvezda, astronauts would have to reconfigure the
dock in the Zarya module now in orbit. That would require a $4
million Russian-built metal pressure dome to provide the astronauts
an air-filled working space. Weldon said the space agency should
set a launching date for the interim module in order to keep the
pressure on the Russians. ``They don't understand talking,'' he
said. ``We should be prepared to work with them, and if they don't
deliver, we should be ready and able to work without them.
</P>
<P>
   If Zvezda is successfully launched on time, the interim control
module will still become part of the station, but in a slightly
different role.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the space station has already circled Earth more than
8,200 times, empty and falling.

AS JOHN PAUL NEARS 80, CHURCH WEIGHS QUESTION OF SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JEFF ISRAELY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images of frailty are unavoidable: the elderly pontiff
nodding off at a Mass in Bethlehem, stumbling and cutting his head
in Warsaw, relying on a cart with wheels to traverse St. Peter's
Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   The once vigorous man who slipped away from the Vatican for
skiing holidays now physically trembles and slurs his speech,
apparent side effects of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Pope John Paul II's physical weakness seems to have
endeared him to the public _ the photographs of the frail old man
praying alone before the Western Wall in Jerusalem, shuffling
painfully across the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial seemed to serve
as powerful images of spiritual intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But as John Paul approaches his 80th birthday on Thursday,
Catholics have quietly begun to consider the inevitable moment when
John Paul's death or, less likely, retirement will create an
opening for a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is the world's most visible and influential religious
figure, considered by observant Catholics to be infallible when
speaking on faith and morals. Not only is he the spiritual leader
of the largest branch of Christianity _ there are an estimated 1
billion Catholics _ but he also commands unrivaled access to the
media and to world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has used his pulpit to speak out on a variety of
economic and social policies, from his lifelong fight against
communism to his ardent opposition to abortion and capital
punishment. The results have been mixed, but his moral suasion was
cited by the White House when explaining its support for
international debt relief and by the governor of Missouri when
commuting the death sentence for a triple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The next leader of the world's Catholics will be chosen, as
virtually all popes have been, by an extremely select group of men:
Roman Catholic cardinals under the age of 80. Right now, there are
104 cardinal-electors, although that number could rise if John Paul
creates more cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals aren't talking _ Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston
did not return a call seeking comment _ and when the time comes,
they will deliberate behind closed doors inside the Sistine Chapel.
But others have begun to write and speak about the first papal
election of the church's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among journalists at the Vatican, talk of who will be the next
pope started around eight years ago,'' said Marco Tosatti, who for
the last 18 years has been the Vatican correspondent for La Stampa,
a Turin-based daily. ``I've seen so many candidates over the years,
cardinals who six years ago a lot of people would say this could
very likely be the next pope, who are now dead or forgotten or very
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals believe the pope is actually chosen by the Holy
Spirit, who moves through them to guide their voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the cardinals will be looking for a
characteristic and then trying to find the man to fit that,'' said
the Rev. Todd Lajiness, a Detroit native who now works inside the
Vatican. ``That's a political, or I guess you could even say,
democratic, outlook. That's good for government. The church is a
much different entity.''
</P>
<P>
   But most observers say the cardinals also weigh a number of
strategic and political considerations when they gather.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key factors to be weighed when considering the
candidates for pope: age, geography, ideology, diplomatic and
communication skills, and health.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and church officials interviewed in Italy and the
United States generally seemed to agree that the cardinals are
likely to be seeking a pope who is:
</P>
<P>
   --Old. Karol Wojtyla was just 58 when he became Pope John Paul
II, and as a result, his papacy has already lasted 21 years. A long
papacy tends to concentrate church power in Rome, and the cardinals
are expected to look for a pope in his 70s who probably would have
a shorter tenure and accumulate less power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as they like the present pope, there are problems when
a pope stays too long,'' said Richard P. McBrien, a Notre Dame
theologian and author of ``Lives of the Popes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of complaints about this pontificate
because it has tended to recentralize authority in the Vatican, and
there is a lot of resentment of the way they treat bishops like
altar boys. They'd like some breathing space after such a long and
dominating pontificate as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   --European. John Paul is the first Slavic pope, and the first
non-Italian since Hadrian VI died in 1523. The Italian cardinals, a
declining plurality in the College of Cardinals, are expected to
make a play to win the papacy back, and there are also strong
candidates from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinals, having made a bold move in choosing a Pole in
1978, are thought likely to retreat to their comfort zone. There is
a long-shot chance that the cardinals would do something more
dramatic, choosing a pope from the Southern Hemisphere to
acknowledge that Africa and Latin America are rapidly becoming the
heart of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no chance the next pope will be an
American, because Americans are viewed as too liberal and too
powerful, and because the one American cardinal in recent years
widely judged to be electable, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin of
Chicago, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American has no chance,'' said Brian H. Smith, professor of
religion at Ripon College. ``The American church is looked upon as
too liberal, we have a very outspoken laity, and America represents
wealth and power in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   --Conservative, but less so than John Paul. The College of
Cardinals is a conservative group, dominated by appointees of John
Paul II. But scholars say the cardinals have historically tended to
oscillate between conservative and more moderate papacies, and
after such a long conservative papacy they may be looking for
someone more open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinals are probably going to look for somebody who is a
bit more liberal, in terms of his views about authority, than the
current pontiff,'' said Fitchburg (Mass.) State College President
Michael P. Riccards, the author of ``Vicars of Christ: Popes,
Power, and Politics in the Modern World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a historic type of occurrence, as the cardinals,
who are pretty sophisticated, realize the institution has gone as
far as it can in one direction and try to bring it back to an even
keel,'' Riccards said.
</P>
<P>
   --Media-savvy and diplomatic. John Paul is the most traveled
pope in history, having taken 91 international trips during his
papacy; as a former actor he has been praised for his use of the
media to communicate positive images of the church, and he has
successfully improved relations with other religions. These
characteristics, particularly in an Information Age in which popes
are sure to remain highly visible, seem certain to become permanent
requirements for future popes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few positions in the modern world that have the
kind of visibility and moral force to them that the papacy can
have, and I think John Paul II has utilized that,'' said the Rev.
Donald P. Senior, president of Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago. ``The travels of the pope, and his use of the media have
become ingredients of the modern papacy. You couldn't have somebody
who would ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   This pope has succeeded at communicating despite his
increasingly slurred speech. He kisses the earth on arriving in a
new place, meets with youth, and prays in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the age of communication, the pope must have the ability to
communicate, . . . but there are many styles of communication,''
said Pietro Scoppola, an Italian religious history professor.
``This pope uses communication of the symbolical. There are times
he speaks and we can't understand everything he's saying, but the
image of him and his sickness symbolizes the weakness in all
humanity, the mystery of creation.''

<P>
   Over the last 150 years, the burning of coal, oil and natural
gas has released some 270 billion tons of carbon into the air in
the form of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. If all that had stayed in
the atmosphere, much of the substantial global warming predicted
for a century from now might have already taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, more than half the carbon dioxide emitted by
fossil-fuel burning is absorbed from the air by the oceans, by
plants (which use it in converting sunlight to chemical energy) and
especially by soils. Fewer than half the emissions, scientists
believe, remain airborne to warm the earth.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is part of one of nature's grand and endlessly
complicated global recycling networks. In it, carbon is constantly
exchanged among the air, the terrestrial biosphere, the oceans and
the solid rock of the earth at varying rates on time scales ranging
from hours to millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the economic and political difficulty of reducing carbon
dioxide emissions at the source becomes ever more obvious, a
broad-based move is under way to manipulate the carbon cycle so
that it will remove more of the heat-trapping gases from the air.
It is an ambitious idea, but on closer inspection one surrounded by
questions, potential risks and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In one approach, researchers are investigating ways to remove
carbon chemically from industrial and automotive emissions before
they are released to the atmosphere, then to sequester it at some
other way station in the natural carbon cycle _ by injecting the
removed carbon back into underground reservoirs or into the ocean,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy has expanded research into
carbon-removal technologies at eight of its national laboratories.
But this option, the department said in a recent study, is ``truly
radical'' and most experts believe it is some distance from
providing a practical alternative.
</P>
<P>
   More promising in the near term, many scientists believe, are
prospects for increasing the absorption of atmospheric carbon
dioxide by what is called the terrestrial biosphere: that is, the
whole complex of living things on land, mainly plants and various
tiny inhabitants and detritus of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a plant sprouts and grows to maturity, it absorbs
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, breaks it down chemically and
uses carbon as construction material for roots, stem, branches,
flowers and leaves. When the plant dies, some of the carbon goes
back into the atmosphere, but some is also released into the soil
as the dead plant decays. Decomposing animals, including people,
further add to the carbon reservoir in the soil. Globally, soil
contains about five times as much carbon as vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of these carbon reservoirs, or ``sinks,'' in
vegetation and soil has been sanctioned as one way industrialized
countries might meet their obligations under the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol, which is aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide
and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, intense argument has developed over the degree to which
countries like the United States, which may have great potential
for expanding its carbon sinks, ought to be allowed to meet their
emissions reduction targets under the protocol by means like
planting trees, improving forest management and conserving soils
rather than reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars, factories
and power generating stations.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from more than 100 countries are to grapple with the
issue when they meet in November in The Hague, Netherlands, for
what is widely seen as a make-or-break effort to make the Kyoto
Protocol operational.
</P>
<P>
   The rules governing carbon sinks are among the many sets of
yet-to-be adopted regulations necessary to put the protocol into
effect, and only a few countries have ratified the agreement
pending action on them. The United States, where the protocol has
encountered strong opposition in Congress on several grounds, is
one of those holding back.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the critical November meeting, scientists of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, created by the
United Nations more than a decade ago to advise the world's
governments, issued a report on the carbon issue at a meeting last
week in Montreal. The analysis suggested that expansion of
terrestrial carbon sinks in the industrialized countries could
potentially more than enable them to meet their entire combined
emissions reduction quota under the protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But experts associated with the report questioned how much of
that potential could be achieved, given the difficulty of actually
expanding the world's carbon sinks in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging the technical potential is easy,'' said Dr. Robert T.
Watson, chairman of the intergovernmental panel, who is also the
chief atmospheric scientist and environmental adviser of the World
Bank. ``The real question is, what is the likelihood of realizing
that technical potential?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Kyoto Protocol, the rich industrial countries as a
group are obligated to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 5
percent below 1990 levels by about 2010. The reductions are widely
seen as a first step in eventually stabilizing atmospheric
concentrations. If emissions are not reduced, prominent scientists
say, the average global temperature will rise by about 3.5 degrees
Fahrenheit by the year 2100. (By comparison, the world is now 5 to
9 degrees warmer than in the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to
20,000 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   This much warming, the experts say, would bring rising seas,
more severe droughts, rainstorms, heat waves and floods, along with
broad shifts in climatic and agricultural zones that would benefit
some regions but seriously harm others.

UNDATED: harm others.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Environmentalists and some parties to the Kyoto Protocol,
especially the European Union, strenuously object to allowing any
country to meet all or most of its emissions reduction goal by
expanding carbon sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sucking carbon out of the atmosphere is not the same as
preventing it permanently from leaving the exhaust pipe or power
plant,'' said Jennifer Morgan, director of the World Wildlife
Fund's climate change campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that since forests can always be cut
down as well as planted, and soils can always be plowed up as well
as conserved, the terrestrial biosphere is not nearly as secure a
carbon reservoir as the underground reservoirs where coal, oil and
gas are contained. So, they say, why remove them from that secure
spot in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   They also fear that reliance on sinks to meet the Kyoto targets
could delay the adoption of measures to reduce fossil fuel use and
replace it with other energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, scientists say, carbon sinks will eventually
probably reach a saturation point, at which they will be unable to
absorb any more carbon dioxide.The dominant view therefore remains
that if the world is serious about reducing and stabilizing the
atmospheric concentrations, emissions must be cut at the source by
burning fossil fuels more efficiently, switching from relatively
high-carbon fuels like coal to lower-carbon natural gas, and
replacing fossil fuels altogether by alternatives like hydrogen
fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   Given the slow progress in that direction, though, proponents of
the carbon sink idea argue that it could be a valuable interim
measure.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, however, human activity has been shrinking carbon
sinks rather than expanding them. Deforestation and farming have
obliterated great stretches of forest and grassland that once
absorbed carbon dioxide. Farming has also chopped up soils in ways
that cause them to give off carbon dioxide rather than to sequester
it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said the scientific report issued in Montreal, human
use of the terrestrial biosphere, including the burning of wood,
has released some 135 billion tons of carbon into the air since
1850 _ about half as much as has been emitted by fossil fuel
burning.
</P>
<P>
   The net result of all this is that overall atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide are about 30 percent higher now
than at the start of the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   A de facto counterattack has been under way for some time in the
Northern Hemisphere, where the replanting of forests on deforested
lands has made headway in recent decades. One provision of the
Kyoto Protocol allows for industrialized countries to gain credit
toward their reduction targets for tree planting since 1990 _ but
also to incur debits for any deforestation since then. To reap
meaningful credit, a country would have to show a net gain.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol also allows countries to gain credit for reductions
through a variety of other ways of expanding terrestrial carbon
stocks should the parties to the agreement so decide. These
include, for instance, expanding carbon stores in soil through
no-till agriculture, in which no plowing takes place and seeds are
sown in the carbon-rich detritus of the previous year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include conversion of cropland into
grassland, fertilization of pastureland and forest management
practices designed to increase carbon stocks _ for example,
lengthening the period between harvests of a forest's timber, or
promoting faster tree growth and thicker stands of trees,
plantation-style.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates suggest that these kinds of measures might allow some
countries to achieve large cuts in net carbon dioxide emissions.
The potential of such measures in the United States, Canada and
Russia is great, according to a recent calculation made for the
World Wildlife Fund by Kevin Gurney, an atmospheric researcher at
Colorado State University who studies the carbon cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney estimated, for example, that without planting any trees,
the measures would potentially enable the United States to remove
about 150 million tons of carbon a year from the atmosphere. This
exceeds its Kyoto emissions reduction target by tens of millions of
tons. ``They're pretty big,'' Gurney said of the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal report estimated that in theory, measures other
than tree-planting by the industrialized countries could remove
nearly 290 million more tons of carbon a year from the atmosphere
by about 2010 than are removed by such measures now. By comparison,
the Kyoto Protocol would require the rich countries to cut
emissions by about 200 million tons a year below 1990 levels by
about 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The report also raised caveats about how much of this estimated
potential might be achieved. Even with ``an ambitious policy
agenda,'' it said, the estimates were ``likely to be on the high
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Far smaller gains could be achieved by the rich countries by
planting trees and slowing deforestation, the report concluded. It
said that a 20 percent increase in forest planting would probably
offset no more than 3 million tons of carbon emissions a year
globally, while slowing deforestation by 20 percent could offset
about 18 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the potential for carbon sequestration can be realized
to a substantial degree, many headaches still present themselves.
For instance, forest growth is spurred _ and terrestrial carbon
stocks are increased _ by a warming climate, and by rising levels
of carbon dioxide and of atmospheric nitrogen deposited on forests
as a result of industrial emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing a country's carbon stocks for purposes of assigning
credit, how can these effects of human activity be separated from
the growth in carbon stocks brought about by tree-planting efforts
alone? It is almost impossible to make such a separation, Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty for some kinds of carbon sequestration
efforts is that of monitoring and accounting for carbon stocks.
Although there are well-established means of measuring the increase
of carbon in a stand of growing trees, other sinks may present
problems. One way to get around the difficulty in the case of
agricultural soils might be to set up a business-as-usual control
plot, in which conventional farming methods are used, against which
to measure the change in carbon stocks as a result of no-till
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are ecological concerns. For instance, managers of
carbon-sequestration projects might be tempted to replace naturally
functioning forests with tree plantations, which in biological
terms are comparatively poor and sterile, with little of the
biological richness and variety of the wild woods. Likewise,
managers might be tempted to cut down mature forests so as to plant
new, faster-growing ones that sequester carbon at a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   It is on questions of detail like these that the success or
failure of the Kyoto Protocol may ultimately hinge.

`REVOLUTIONARY ETUDE,' RENDERED BY A WREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Hong Kong, Macau, Australia, Austria, Costa
Rica)  (The Science Times) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a drizzly afternoon here, Dr. Luis F.
Baptista, 58, an enthusiastic man with dark hair and the accent of
his native Macau, was showing a New York visitor the ins and outs
of daily life in this city's Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where a white crowned sparrow I used to know once
lived,'' Baptista said, pointing to an ornamental African aloe
tree. ``She was very dominant to her husband, whom she beat up on
all the time. However, one day, she divorced him, moved to a
different tree a few hundred feet away and married another guy who
then beat up on her. I couldn't understand what she saw in him. But
they raised more white crowned babies than anyone else in the park.
She must have realized there was something special about the new
guy, in terms of evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptista knows all the soap opera details of the lives of Golden
Gate Park's birds. As chairman and curator of ornithology and
mammalogy of the California Academy of Sciences, based in the park,
he has spent a lifetime studying the mating habits, songs and
language of birds. The author of some 127 papers on the subject,
Baptista is among the world's leading experts on bird song, dialect
and language.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat under the tree of the much abused and abusive white
crowned sparrow, Baptista speculated about an ancient question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1950s rock classic, ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the
singer Frankie Lymon, asked, ``Why do birds sing soooo gaa-aye?''
Do you know why?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They sing, for one thing, because the bachelor male wants to
attract a wife. He also wants to show other males that he's pretty
studly, that this is his territory and no one is going to cross the
boundaries. A third reason is that the song induces the female
bird's brain to send hormones: It makes her ovaries grow.
</P>
<P>
   We can actually show that birds have an aesthetic sense similar
to ours. If you take female great reed warblers, stick them with
female hormones, put them in a soundproof box and play for them
recordings of male songs _ some beautiful and some yuckie _ you
will see that they solicit copulation more from the beautiful songs
than the yuckie ones. That means that the females actually prefer
beautiful songs, even what humans consider beautiful.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there cases when humans, like certain birds, have a
sexual response to songs?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suppose there are. You remember all those Beatles concerts
and the girls passing out to the sounds of the Beatles and Elvis
Presley? For me, it's Montserrat Caballe. When she sings, I feel
like I've gone to heaven.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think, as it has sometimes been suggested, that birds
sing for the pure pleasure of it?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a possibility. Konrad Lorenz (the Austrian
zoologist) had a jackdaw, and he said that when the bird would have
a nice meal and was relaxed and had no stress, it would sit on a
tree and sing. It would use all the calls in its vocabulary and he
would do these movements like a Shakespearean actor doing a
soliloquy. And Lorenz suggested it was a form of play. So in that
sense, I would say that it is quite possible that birds _ when they
are happy, well fed, without stress, without predators _ sing just
because they feel good. Q. Haven't you also noted that some birds
are instrumentalists?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, absolutely. The black palm cockatoo actually shakes a
piece of stick that it uses as a drumstick. Then, it holds it with
one foot and bangs it against a hollow log, as he's calling and
displaying to attract the female.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, we have lots of woodpeckers. Woodpeckers peck,
of course, to get bugs. But they also peck to make music because
they don't have a vocal song like song birds. So what they do is
they look for a nice log that makes the correct sound and then,
they pound on it with a specific rhythm. This means that tool
making is not an exclusive property of humans or other primates.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do birds have language?
</P>
<P>
   A. They don't have a grammar. The definition of a language to a
linguist includes grammar, but they do use different sounds that
communicate different messages. A chicken, if you show it a picture
of raccoon, it will recognize it as a predator and make a certain
clucking sounds and all the other chickens will look around for a
raccoon. On the other hand, if you show it a picture of a falcon,
it makes a different sound and looks up, which means ``the danger
is in the sky.'' Song birds have that too.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some scientists insist that the particular sounds that birds
make are just instinctive reactions. How would you answer them?
</P>
<P>
   A. I guess the same could be said for humans then because we
instinctively react to certain kinds of sounds, right? I don't see
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   There are some bird sounds produced that are learned. I studied
a European bird called the chaffinch and it has a vocabulary of 10,
12 different sounds. But it has different alarm calls. There's one
for the hawk flying overhead: ``This is not a serious danger.'' A
different call means: ``Let's get the hell out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. You study bird dialects. Why would a bird have a dialect? Is
there an evolutionary reason?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My favorite theory is that the structure of a bird song is
determined by what will carry best in its home environment. Let's
say, you have one bird that lives in a coniferous forest and
another in an oak forest. Since the song is passed down by
tradition, then let's say there's an oak woodland dialect and
coniferous woodland dialect. If you reproduce the sounds, you will
find that the oak sound carries farther in an oak forest than it
does in a coniferous forest, and vice versa.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did bird dialect and music become your passion?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It started when I was a boy in Hong Kong. I went to teahouses
where people kept their song birds on the top floor. The practice
enchanted me. I also kept two parakeets and then I had canaries. I
had young canaries and I was impatient to get them singing. So I
started singing to them. To my amazement, when they were adults,
they sang just like me.  &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO: like me.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What are the parallels between human and bird music?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I know of birds who have voices with tonal qualities that
sound like real instruments. The strawberry finch has beautiful
single notes that come down the scale and that sound just like a
flute. There is another bird, the diamond firetail from Australia,
whose voice sounds like some kind of woodwind, an oboe perhaps.
Then, in Costa Rica, I've encountered a wonderful night bird, and
it sings four notes coming down the scale, and the quality of its
voice is just like a bassoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you look at pitch, scholars have found that certain
birds use the same musical scales of human cultures. One scholar
has found that the hermit thrush actually sings in the pentatonic
scale used in Far Eastern music. One of the most incredible cases
is the canyon wren, who sings in the chromatic scale, and his song
reminds me of the introduction and finale of Chopin's
``Revolutionary Etude.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you tell when convergence occurs? And when is man just
borrowing sounds heard in nature?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In this case, it is really a convergence because there's no
way that Chopin ever got to where this bird lives: California.
However, there are real cases of borrowing. In the Sixth Symphony
in the second movement of Beethoven, you can very clearly hear the
three-note call of the European quail and the two-note call of the
cuckoo.
</P>
<P>
   There's Mozart's starling. Meredith West and Andrew King of the
Indiana University have studied Mozart's piece, ``The Musical
Joke,'' which musicologists have been puzzled by, because it's not
really of the quality of Mozart. The horns are playing off key and
there are all sorts of strange devices there that offend musicians.
West and King kept starlings and they found that starlings do all
the things that are found in this piece by Mozart, such as stopping
a motif in midsection. And this particular piece was written six
days after his pet starling died. Mozart wrote it, we can surmise,
as a tribute to his friend.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard birds sing in what seems like a sonata style. Can
they?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They do, in the sense that they have an exposition of a
theme. Very often, they have variations in theme reminiscent of
canonical variations like Mozart's Sonata in A major, where you
have theme and variation. And eventually, they come back to the
original theme. They probably do it for the same reasons that
humans compose sonatas. Both humans and birds get bored with
monotony. And to counter monotony, you always have to do something
new to keep the brain aroused.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Bird song patterns are quirky and cute, but what do they
mean?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it doesn't have to mean anything. It's just wonderful
that animals and humans can converge.

NEW QUESTIONS ON CLOT-BUSTING DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., Md., Minn.)   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three large new studies are challenging the safety and benefits
of clot-busting drugs for older people suffering heart attacks,
particularly those 75 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs fail to benefit many such heart attack patients, and
those 75 and older may be at higher risk of death from bleeding,
strokes and ruptured hearts, two of the studies found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are surprising because of a widespread belief that
clot-busting drugs help older patients just as they clearly do
younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association and the American College of
Cardiology recommend use of clot-busting drugs in heart attack
patients. But the two leading heart organizations caution that
evidence for the drugs' effectiveness and safety in older people
has been equivocal. TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) and
streptokinase are the two main clot-busting drugs, also known as
thrombolytics.
</P>
<P>
   About a million Americans suffer heart attacks each year, and
about one-third of them occur in people 75 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Now an urgent need exists to reassess the recommendations for
treating heart attacks in older people, particularly because the
number of heart attacks in people over 75 is growing rapidly as the
population ages, said the researchers from Harvard, Johns Hopkins
and Yale who led the studies. The same point was stressed in an
editorial in the journal Circulation, which is publishing the Johns
Hopkins study Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clot-buster drugs are major weapons in the emergency treatment
of heart attacks. If injected intravenously within the first 12
hours after a heart attack, the drugs can dissolve the blood clots
that form in coronary arteries that were previously narrowed by
arteriosclerosis. The clots stop the flow of blood carrying oxygen
and other nutrients, leading to death of heart muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   New studies are needed to directly compare clot-busting drugs
and other therapies like angioplasty in people 75 and older, the
researchers said. (Angioplasty is a procedure in which a tube with
a balloon on its tip is guided to a blocked coronary artery to
widen it.)
</P>
<P>
   Such studies are difficult to conduct. One study had to be
stopped several years ago because too many doctors were unwilling
to recommend that their elderly heart attack patients enter a study
in which the choice of treatment _ a clot-busting drug or a
placebo, or dummy solution _ was made by a flip of the coin.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings are particularly important because they were
based on actual practice and not from clinical trials on selected
patients, the researchers said. Doctors in practice do not always
adhere to the rigorous scientific blueprints used in clinical
trials. Also, such studies tend to select healthier and younger
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Johns Hopkins and Yale researchers based their studies
on information from the federal Medicare health insurance program,
but analyzed it by different methods. The Harvard researchers
studied medical practice in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were similar, but differed in certain ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns Hopkins study involved 7,864 Medicare patients aged 65
to 86, and it measured outcomes 30 days after patients received
clot-busting drugs or no therapy. It found that the benefits of
clot-busting drugs varied markedly with age.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attack patients from 76 to 86 who received clot-busting
drugs were nearly 40 percent more likely to die within 30 days of
treatment than their counterparts who were not given the
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Patients from 65 to 75 who received clot-busting therapy had a
30-day death rate of 6.8 percent, compared with 9.8 percent for
patients who did not get the drugs. Among patients 76 to 86, the
pattern was reversed: the death rate for patients treated with
clot-busting drugs was 18 percent, compared with 15.4 percent for
patients who did not get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was surprising was not only the lack of benefit but also
that actually there was harm,'' said Dr. Neil R. Powe, a co-author
of the Johns Hopkins study.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study also showed an increased risk of death among
heart attack patients older than 75 who received clot-busting
drugs. They were treated at 37 community hospitals that had 80
percent of the acute care beds in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Of 289 patients older than 75 who received the clot-busting
drugs, 58, or 20.1 percent, died. This compared with 204 deaths
among the 1,239, or 16.5 percent, of those who did not receive the
drug therapy, Dr. Stephen B. Soumerai, a drug policy researcher at
Harvard Medical School, reported at a meeting of the Society of
General Internal Medicine this month in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Soumerai's team estimated that heart attack patients aged 80 to
90 who were treated with clot-busting drugs had a 30 percent
greater risk of death than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The study that Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz led at Yale came up with
puzzling findings about the benefits and risks of clot-busting
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale study included more than 37,000 Medicare patients 65
and older. Unlike the Johns Hopkins study, it included patients who
had angioplasty and evaluated their status both at 30 days and one
year after therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 days, patients who received clot-busting drugs did not
have a higher survival rate than those who did not receive either
therapy; angioplasty did provide a better survival rate than
clot-busting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year, patients who had received either clot-busting
drugs or angioplasty had a higher survival rate than those who had
received neither.
</P>
<P>
   Krumholz said he could not explain why clot-busting therapy
provided a long-term benefit but not a short-term one in the study.
The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of the
American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings from the three studies are consistent in
questioning current conventional wisdom about thrombolytics, but
how they affect practice needs to be discussed,'' Krumholz said. &QL;

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Even as U.N. officials on Monday
confirmed the release of 139 peacekeepers held hostage by rebels,
thereby delivering the best piece of news since the beginning of a
humiliating month in this corner of Africa, there was hardly
ringing praise for the man who had made it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you might think or say of the role of President
Charles Taylor in the Sierra Leone crisis,'' Oluyemi Adeniji, the
U.N. special envoy to Sierra Leone, said at a news conference
Monday, ``I think you have to admit that he is playing a positive
role.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments signaled the United Nations' unease in dealing with
Taylor, the former warlord who terrorized a population into making
him president of Liberia, after fruitless negotiations with Sierra
Leone's top warlord, Foday Sankoh, led to the current crisis.
Indeed, Taylor has for years been the principal ally of Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front, allowing the rebel group to smuggle
diamonds through Liberia and making arms available to it.
</P>
<P>
   And so, a week after Sankoh disappeared from his home in the
capital and Taylor was asked by neighboring countries to act as a
mediator in the hostage crisis, the rebels released the 139
hostages _ with 347 now left in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The 139 hostages, whose condition was not clear, were taken out
of eastern Sierra Leone on Sunday night and sent across the border
into Liberian custody in a town called Foya, said David Wimhurst,
the spokesman for the U.N. force. They were being flown Monday to
the Liberian capital, Monrovia, before their scheduled return here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adeniji, who visited Taylor in Monrovia on Sunday, said the
hostages had been released ``unconditionally.'' But Taylor appeared
to want an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that the
lives of the remaining hostages might be in danger if
pro-government forces continued pushing rebels east into the
hinterland in ``RUF areas,'' Adeniji said, referring to Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned specifically the case of Masiaka,'' Adeniji said.
</P>
<P>
   Masiaka, an important junction town only 40 miles from the
capital, has been the center of battle in recent days. The town had
been under government control before the rebel uprising early this
month, and drawing the line there would increase rebel-held
territory and widen the distance to the all-important diamond mines
in the east.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in New York Monday that
all of Sierra Leone should be brought under government control.
``You cannot have a state where a group of rebels arrogate to
themselves the right to exploit the riches of the country, either
for themselves or for a war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the hostages underscored Taylor's continuing
influence over the Revolutionary United Front despite what appeared
to be a cooling in his relationship with Sankoh a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a convict who bribed his way out of a Massachusetts
prison, where he was awaiting extradition to Liberia on
embezzlement charges, began his war in Liberia in 1989. Taylor
needed Sierra Leone's diamonds to finance his war, and became
allied with Sankoh, who began his movement in Sierra Leone in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the two men were allies in their respective
wars and used similar strategies _ kidnapping children, turning
them into soldiers through forced use of drugs, deliberately
targeting civilians to create terror. In 1998, Liberians elected
Taylor president, mainly because they were tired of war and
believed that Taylor would take up arms if he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming president, Taylor has tried to burnish his image.
Last year, he played a crucial role in the Sierra Leone peace talks
by encouraging Sankoh to sign the accord. He was rewarded in July
when President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and President
Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, which had fought against Taylor as
part of a West African intervention force, went to Monrovia to
commemorate the three-year anniversary of the end of the Liberian
war.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor apparently thought he had not been rewarded
sufficiently for his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually complains that he has not gotten any aid from the
West and he needs it to rebuild his country,'' said a diplomat who
was involved in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Liberia continued to be a conduit for diamonds smuggled out of
Sierra Leone. According to the Diamonds High Council in Antwerp,
Belgium, Sierra Leone exported only $31 million in diamonds last
year; Liberia, which has only a fraction of Sierra Leone's diamond
mines, exported $298 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Sankoh joined a power-sharing government here last year
and was made chairman of a commission that oversees the nation's
mineral resources, he made plans to deal directly with diamond
dealers in the West, effectively cutting out Taylor from the
picture, government officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   That plan seemed to have strained the two men's relationship.
Sam ``Mosquito'' Bockarie, who had been the rebel group's field
commander and was close to Taylor, fled Sierra Leone after a
falling out with Sankoh late last year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bockarie remained in exile in Liberia with men loyal to him. On
Sunday night, he spoke in Monrovia at the presidency, saying that
the rebels here should stop fighting with the U.N. force. He denied
that he was involved in the crisis here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just fabrication,'' he said. ``I will not go back there
after they have spoiled things with the U.N. If I go there, I am
going to mess myself up.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With Sankoh still missing, Taylor seems to be the best hope for
the United Nations and the Sierra Leonean government to obtain the
release of the remaining hostages and help deal with the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is the stability of Sierra Leone, and so it is in
our interest to maintain good relations with Liberia,'' said
Septimus Kaikai, the spokesman for Kabbah. ``I don't know what
President Taylor's motivation is. But politics makes strange
bedfellows.''

&HT;     PRIVATIZATION OPPONENTS BASH BUSH SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents of privatizing Social Security on Monday
said Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan to set up private investment
accounts for younger workers would ``blow a hole in whatever
financial problem Social Security now faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, said in a
speech in Ambler, Pa., that the Bush plan ``could lead to greater
reward for some _ but far greater costs and risks for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Social Security must be preserved ``as a bedrock
guarantee of retirement security.'' He advocates using the budget
surplus to pay down the national debt and use the money saved by
the resulting lower interest costs to bolster Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, which provides $32.5 billion in monthly
benefits to 44.5 million retirees and persons with disabilities, is
shaping up as a cutting-edge issue in the 2000 campaign, with Bush
and Gore offering radically different visions of how to resuscitate
the 65-year-old federal pension system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush unveiled his plan in a speech Monday in Rancho Cucamonga,
Calif., saying it would bring a higher rate of return to
beneficiaries and restore the system to fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security benefits of those now retired or near
retirement would stay the same, an undefined portion of younger
workers' payroll taxes could be channeled into investment accounts,
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of privatization praised Bush for articulating a
reasonable way to help Social Security dig itself out of the
financial rut it faces. Social Security's future imbalance stems
from the fact that the 44-million strong Generation X _ born
between 1965 and 1977 _ will have to shoulder the impending
retirement of the 77-million strong baby-boom generation, born
between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bush plan, ``Social Security would be made a program
that saves rather than spends,'' said Michael Tanner of the
Washington-based Cato Institute. ``Workers, not politicians, would
control investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Thau, the head of Third Millennium, an organization that
advocates public policies for members of Generation X, said private
investment accounts would offer younger workers a way to break out
of over-reliance on a system that pays an average of $804-a-month
in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the economy hums along and every worker gets
everything promised, you still haven't provided true retirement
security to baby boomers,'' Thau said. ``The fact is that $804 a
month, or the inflation-adjusted equivalent in the future, just
doesn't cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hickey, co-chair of the liberal Campaign for America's
Future, said Bush's plan is the latest manifestation of ``Wall
Street money pouring into Washington to convince the Congress and
the American people that Social Security was in crisis, and that
privatization was the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``program would blow a hole in whatever financial
problems Social Security now faces,'' Hickey said at a press
conference of privatization opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO also sounded its opposition to the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   Diverting a portion of payroll tax money into private accounts
would ``undermine the foundation that Social Security provides for
our retirement and disability insurance,'' said Richard Trumka,
secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. The plan, if combined with
Bush's ambitious tax cut proposal, ``abandons debt reduction and
fiscal responsibility,'' Trumka said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush stated that a young worker holding a private
account over the course of a working career would be in far
superior economic shape at retirement than a young worker without
one.
</P>
<P>
   But Hans Riemer, the 27-year-old director of the
Washington-based 2030 Center _ a liberal advocacy organization that
focuses on government entitlement programs _ argued that
``privatization is actually about the worst thing you can do for
young workers today.''
</P>
<P>
   Earning retirement dollars through a private investment account
would require a certain amount of investment savvy and plain old
good luck, he said. In contrast, Social Security offers ``a
guaranteed rock-solid benefit It is for everyone, no matter who you
are, what you look like (or) where you live,'' Riemer said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his group hired a plane to fly over Rancho
Cucamonga Monday during Bush's speech trailing a sign reading
``Don't Privatize Social Security.''

<P>
   SANTA CLARA PUEBLO, N.M. _ The battle to contain the wildfire
here has broken down into several diverging fronts, with modest
signs of hope in the city of Los Alamos, where some residents were
allowed to return Monday, but also growing anger over the threat to
ancient Indian dwellings and lands that tribal officials say had
initially not been well protected.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Santa Clara canyon at the northern perimeter
Monday brought an encounter with swirls of thick white smoke, brush
fires just yards from the road, occasionally exploding pine trees
and nervous teams of firefighters known as hotshots, able to do
little more than hope that blazes along the southern edge of the
canyon would not be blasted by the winds toward the invaluable
archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Alamos, at the southern edge of the wildfire, and at the
nuclear weapons laboratory nearby, officials said the fire was
largely contained and that perhaps 10 percent of the 11,000
evacuated residents may be permitted to return soon. But they are
now taking stock of the staggering losses, which include 405
housing units and, at the lab site, five dilapidated but historic
structures where parts of the original atomic bomb were assembled
for the Manhattan Project during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the old wooden structures remained, the building
where the conventional explosives portion of the first bomb, known
as Trinity, was put together. The actual building where the Trinity
bomb was assembled, a simple wooden structure, was taken down years
ago, said Turnel Martinez, a lab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said in Los Alamos that the pace of destruction
has slowed, and that the fire had consumed at least 44,323 acres.
More important, they said, the fire is 28 percent contained, mostly
along the south and southeast edge, near the city of Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 1,268 firefighters battling the blaze in the
wooded areas, and an additional 250 or so protecting homes and
other structures in populated areas, a level that Jim Paxon, the
Forest Service spokesman, said would likely be the peak. The fire
was set 10 days ago by the National Park Service in what was
conceived as a controlled burn to thin dense pine forests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news was generally good on the level of containment
in the south, winds are expected to pick up, and a cold front is
predicted for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have continued fear possible leaks of radiation
from the grounds of the lab, both from structures that might have
been damaged by fire or from old dump sites where, years ago, the
lab put low-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the lab said no buildings containing radioactive
materials had been damaged and that their sensors had detected no
radiation leaks. In addition, Gregg Dempsey, the director of a unit
at the Environmental Protection Agency that monitors radiation,
said that the government has placed 20 more monitors around the Los
Alamos region.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we're not seeing any cause for concern for
radiological release,'' said Jim Straka, a Department of Energy
official involved in the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   But to the north, Indian officials expressed concern over what
they said was a slow initial response to the fire in their area,
and the heavy blow they could suffer if the fire jumps across the
Santa Clara canyon, on the Pueblo, or reservation, northeast of Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara Pueblo covers almost 50,000 acres and has about
1,500 residents. It is also home to spectacular ancient dwellings
that are believed to have been constructed about 800 years ago into
the buff-hued sandstone of the Puye cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose that canyon and the creek, we lose quite a bit of
our resources,'' said Denny Gutierrez, the governor of the Santa
Clara Pueblo tribal authority.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a major source of revenues for the tribe are the
fees it charges for permits to hunt, fish and camp in the canyon
and for visits to the Puye cliffs. A big concern is that the fire
could dump huge amounts of ash into the Santa Clara creek, in the
bottom of the canyon, choking it off and making it unusable for
irrigation or recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, that would probably devastate the Pueblo,'' said
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   He said firefighters were doing an excellent job, but that when
the fire first burst out of control, firefighters were slow in
responding to suggestions that they build firelines to the north,
not just in the south near Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sounded to us like this was not a priority,'' said
Charles Sisneros, a tribal council member. ``That's not the way we
see it. This is our home and we have an obligation to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Baca, another member of the tribal council, stood in the
bottom of the canyon Monday watching the blaze send up huge plumes
of white smoke and brush fires burn to the road, and said he was
also angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indecision was the problem,'' he said. ``We asked them to
cut the fire lines on the Forest Service land and they just said
they hadn't gotten the permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon of the forest service said the firefighters had done
everything they could. ``Our object is to minimize the impact on
the Santa Clara Pueblo,'' said Paxon. ``We do take their needs to
heart. We feel we have adequate resources there. We didn't delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the pueblo lands were now among the most
vulnerable, particularly if the wind does whip up as expected.
Jerry Soard, a member of a hotshot crew from Carson City, Nev.,
watched as the fire spread its dark fingers down the canyon and
tightened its grip over the heavily wooded Indian land. He
expressed some optimism because the fire was moving slowly and
burning highly combustible brush that could feed an even fiercer
fire if the winds picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing pretty much what we want it to do at this point,''
said Soard. ``This is beneficial. It's a real nice backing fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this meant the fire might be brought under control
here, another hotshot team member, Chris White, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control? You can't say that,'' said White. ``Not with these
winds. The problem is that when they get into the canyon they get
so squirrelly. They blow every direction.''

ROCKING THE RETIREMENT BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed on Monday the most drastic change in the
Social Security system since Franklin Roosevelt devised it 65 years
ago. Unlike Roosevelt's plan, which united all the elements of
society to provide retirees with a guaranteed pension, Bush's plan
would divide Americans into two groups: those with the resources to
speculate with their Social Security money and those who depend on
every nickel to scrape through their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would not change the system for those near age 65. But, he
said, ``reform should include personal retirement accounts for
young people.'' Some portion, perhaps 2 percent, of the 12.4
percent Social Security tax would be diverted to these accounts as
soon as they began working.
</P>
<P>
   People already amassing private retirement assets would know
exactly what to do with that money. But those with limited means
would be prudent to put the money into government bonds, which do
not pay much more than Social Security. If they speculated in
stocks and got caught in a bear market on the verge of retirement,
the government might not make up their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush makes much of the fact that many people already invest in
stocks to pay for their retirement, and every American who can
afford one should have a private retirement account. But every
American also relies on Social Security as a bedrock retirement
income, no matter what happens on Wall Street. There is no reason
to threaten what Bush acknowledges is ``the single most successful
government program in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security does face financing problems in about 20 years.
Bush is right that a bipartisan commission should be formed to
address this difficulty. Supporters of the system have already
advanced reforms to keep it solvent while preserving its essential
character, including investing some of the tax proceeds in the
stock market on a collective basis.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is one of the great institutions of social unity
and financial stability in American society. The next president
should seek to improve the system while preserving its cohesive
force and its guarantee of a secure income for all retirees.

PURE PUTIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russians and their well-wishers abroad did not have to wait very
long for the first premonitions of what life may be like under
President Vladimir Putin. The curtain-raiser for the new era
suggests that, as many Russian and foreign analysts have feared,
Putin's reign may be modeled after the authoritarian regime of
General Augusto Pinochet in Chile: free markets without free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after his inauguration, the former KGB colonel sent
security troops in ski masks and camouflage outfits on a raid of
the Moscow offices of Media MOST, the independent media
conglomerate that had been publishing and broadcasting materials
disclosing Kremlin corruption and incompetence and criticizing the
conduct of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the motives for the crackdown on the parent company of
the TV network NTV, the newspaper Segodnya, and the magazine Itogi
are known. In the fierce partisan arena of Russia's media politics,
these properties of the tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky had supported
Putin's rivals for the presidency. Also, Gusinsky himself is a
personal and business rival of Boris Berezovsky, the oligarch who
was behind Boris Yeltsin's reelection in 1996 as well as Putin's
meteoric rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Gusinsky's newspaper, Segodnya, published an
article April 26 suggesting that one of the top officials in the
FSB, the intelligence agency Putin himself had headed, is guilty of
corruption. The ensuing crackdown on the press demonstrates that
Putin will not hesitate to use his security services to suppress
journalistic or political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev termed the armed raid on Media MOST a
provocation that ``recalls the methods of the past.'' Grigory
Yavlinksi, the liberal leader of the Yabloko party, called the
crackdown an exercise of ``direct pressure aimed at limiting
freedom of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, with its sorry history of solicitude for the
original Pinochet model of governance, needs to show solidarity
with Russian democrats, and now, while it is still possible to help
them prevent the construction of a police state charged with
managing a capitalist Russia.

BUREAUCRATIC BLAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A professional decision by National Park Service authorities to
clear up a brush problem using the standard ``prescribed burn''
technique went badly awry in Los Alamos this month when high winds
spread the blaze over more than 44,000 acres of New Mexico
woodlands and incinerated 400 homes. A forecast of windy conditions
by the Weather Service, a sister agency, went unheard.
</P>
<P>
   Strict Park Service rules for using such fires have been in
effect since 1996 and are based on years of experience. They set a
variety of conditions _ including humidity along with wind and soil
moisture _ designed expressly to avoid catastrophes like those in
and around Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The fires are, ironically, intended to reduce the danger of
blazes by systematically eliminating underbrush that could be
ignited by lightning or careless campers, the two principal sources
of forest fires. They are used extensively, and the Forest Service
alone tries to burn as many as 3 million acres a year in its
program.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents like this, in which fortunately no lives have been
lost so far, set off more than just the current Department of
Interior investigation of why rules and warnings may have been
ignored. Since many of the homes lost to the fire were themselves
in partially wooded areas, calls for removing trees are almost
inevitable. Conservation organizations, which want to preserve as
much forest as possible, point to alternatives. Much more could be
done to make homes less vulnerable to such fires by removing brush
in residential areas and by having metal roofs, aesthetically less
pleasing but far preferable to total loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as this fire has been, it could have been worse, with loss
of life and a risk to the integrity of nuclear facilities at Los
Alamos. It is a warning that not even well-structured safety
procedures can provide an absolute guarantee that accidents will
not happen as the result of human failings. Still, the Interior
Department should consider tightening its rules, perhaps by
requiring approval from the Weather Service in addition to the
judgment of its own Park Service.

  (With LOS-ALAMOS-FIRE) 
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Whether sparked by lightning, a carelessly
tossed cigarette or a prescribed burn like the one now flaring out
of control, a catastrophic wildfire threatening Los Alamos National
Laboratory was bound to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 report by officials at the Santa Fe National Forest in
northern New Mexico, which borders the area, warned that the next
five years held a 30 percent chance of a fire exceeding 5,000 acres
striking the dense ponderosa pine forests on the western flank of
the laboratory _ just as is now happening.
</P>
<P>
   And an appendix of an environmental impact report published last
year by the Department of Energy describes a situation eerily like
the one now in progress: a fire beginning southwest of the lab
during a bone-dry spring, swept by unrelenting winds toward the
town and laboratory. ``A major fire moving up to the edge of LANL
is not only credible but likely,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of both studies, first reported in Forest
magazine last fall, is that it was only a matter of time before
something like the current wildfire occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Two other devastating fires have raged around Los Alamos in 23
years. The first, the La Mesa fire in 1977, burned 15,270 acres and
jumped onto laboratory property; the second, the Dome Fire in 1996,
burned 16,500 acres, reaching near the edge of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in a region of spectacular summer thunderstorms, an
estimated 372 ``fire starts'' from 1975 to 1996 were ignited by
lightning in 40,000 acres of forests surrounding Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The current fire, which has destroyed more than 400 housing
units in the city of Los Alamos and forced its evacuation, began
May 4 when Parks Service officials ignited brush on a ridge to
eliminate some dry wood and debris that could feed a rampaging
natural blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set despite predictions from the National Weather
Service of high winds and low humidity that could make the fire
difficult to control. On the six-point Haines index, which is used
to help measure volatility, the Weather Service estimated
conditions at six.
</P>
<P>
   Windy conditions are not unusual in the area. The Energy
Department report found that there was frequently a good chance of
winds capable of spreading a fire beyond control. It was ``not
uncommon,'' the report concluded, for strong winds to blow steadily
in the same direction for days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   These factors are particularly hazardous in dense, dry ponderosa
pine forests like those around Los Alamos. A century of suppressing
naturally caused wildfires has helped lead to arboreal growth that
is among the most plentiful in the Southwest. At the turn of the
20th century, before extensive settlement, according to Wallace
Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona University's School of
Forestry in Flagstaff, there were an estimated 20 to 60 trees an
acre. Now there are 300 to 900.
</P>
<P>
   This overcrowding was also encouraged by large-scale grazing
after the coming of the railroads in the late 19th century. With
little grass left to compete with, pine tree seedlings
proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   Tree ring studies show that when the forests were sparser, grass
fires swept through uneventfully every few years. Hugging the
ground, the flames consumed grass instead of giant pines. But with
overgrazing, grass was replaced by a thick carpet of explosive pine
needles _ the bottom rung of a fire ladder that sweeps flames
upward instead of outward, climbing the stunted midget pines right
to the tops of the towering ponderosas.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department says it had begun to take the warnings to
heart, clearing large areas of brush around the lab to reduce the
risk. ``A fair amount of precautions have been taken very
recently,'' said Lisa Cutler, a department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But Covington said that a far more extensive effort of thinning
the thick forests beyond the laboratory might have made all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that kind of project had been put into effect around Los
Alamos, that would have stopped the fire well before it got into
town,'' he said. ``If the trees had been thinned and burned, they
would have caught it.''

&HT;     COURT DENIES RAPE VICTIMS RIGHT TO SUE ATTACKERS IN FEDERAL
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that rape victims
cannot sue their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   It struck down a provision in a 1994 federal law allowing such
lawsuits, saying that Congress, in passing the measure, had
overstepped its bounds and reached into an area reserved for the
states.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotly disputed 5-4 decision in a Virginia case, the court
invalidated the part of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that
authorized victims of gender-related violence to seek civil damages
in federal court rather than rely solely on state prosecutors and
juries.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled against Christy Brzonkala, a former student
at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., who had filed the suit against
two school football players after alleging that they had raped her
in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement saying
he is ``deeply disappointed'' that victims of such crimes may no
longer sue in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I continue to believe that there should be remedies
for victims of gender-motivated violence, we plan to study the
Supreme Court's decision ... to determine the best means to help
these victims,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which
</P>
<P>
   represented Brzonkala, said, ``I consider this to be a severe
blow for women's rights because of the chilling effect it will have
on Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers added that ``Congress identified a kind of gender
discrimination. Congress is trying to address that with a creative,
specific solution, and the court says, `No, you can't do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Michael E. Rosman, who argued the case on behalf of
the two football players, called the decision a ``victory'' for the
Constitution. ``If we had lost, it would have opened the floodgates
to federal intervention in almost any crime,'' he said, adding that
``every crime has an economic impact of some kind or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law after hearing charges that state courts
were not doing enough to protect women from violence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers cited Congress' constitutional power to regulate
interstate commerce as a basis for passing the act. They said
gender-motivated violence was related to interstate commerce
because victims were often unable to work for long periods and cost
the nation $3 billion to $5 billion a year in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court said Monday that the lawsuit provision of
the law would open the door to federal intervention in many areas
traditionally under the control of the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
</P>
<P>
   national and what is truly local,'' Chief Justice William H.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' argument ``would allow (it) to regulate any crime as
long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has
substantial effects on employment, production, transit or
consumption,'' Rehnquist said. ``Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or
any other type of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who sponsored the Violence Against
Women Act, said he did not know what would happen to the rest of
the law. ``The court really went off here in a way that I find
extremely troublesome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Souter cited ``the mountain of data
assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce. ... Violence against women may be
found to affect interstate commerce substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   The case dates from 1995, when Brzonkala said football players
Antonio Morrison and James Crawford raped her in a dormitory room
when she was a freshman at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brzonkala did not report the incident, which allegedly
occurred in September 1994, for nearly seven months. When a grand
jury convened to examine the allegation, she refused to testify.
The grand jury declined to indict either player.
</P>
<P>
   The players contended that consensual sex had occurred. Crawford
was cleared by a university hearing. Morrison, who admitted that
Brzonkala had told him ``no'' twice before they had sex, was
suspended from school for a year. The charge was later reduced to
``abusive language,'' and the suspension was cut to three months,
which allowed Morrison to continue his football career. Brzonkala,
furious at the outcome, withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995 she filed an $8.3 million civil suit in federal
court against the players and the university under the newly passed
Violence Against Women Act. But before the trial began, U.S.
District Judge Jackson L. Kiser dismissed her case in July 1996. In
March 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in
Richmond, Va., agreed. The law, Judge J. Michael Luttig wrote,
``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles of limited
federal government upon which this nation is founded.''On Monday,
the high court affirmed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote that if Brzonkala's allegations ``are true, no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy ...
But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the
commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Congress has used the Constitution's interstate
commerce clause to pass such federal civil rights laws as those
banning discrimination in housing and in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   For several decades, the high court allowed this practice, but
in a 1995 case from San Antonio, the justices said it amounted to
an encroachment of federal power over the states. In that case the
high court invalidated the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which
prohibited possession of firearms near schools, as an improper
infringement on an area of state concern.That decision prompted
lower courts to scrutinize the rationale for other federal laws,
including the lawsuit provision in the Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the constitutional distinction between national
and local matters, Rehnquist said that ``there is no better example
of the police power, which the Founders undeniably left reposed in
the States and denied the central government, than the suppression
of violent crime and vindication of its victims.''

BUSH, GORE SPAR OVER SOCIAL SECURITY REVAMP   PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. _ Texas Governor George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore engaged in a cross-country clash over Social
Security's future Monday, as Bush touted a plan in which workers
would invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the Rancho Cucamonga Senior Center at the base of
the San Gabriel mountains, Bush told about 75 older voters that he
wants to save Social Security before the system goes bankrupt by
giving people more control and greater returns. He also said he
would strengthen Medicare and provide a perscription drug benefit
for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A worker who invests even a limited portion of his or her
paycheck could, over a career, end up with hundreds of thousands of
dollars for retirement,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Social Security talk was intentionally short on nuance
and detail; his economic advisers repeatedly referred to a half
dozen bills pending in Congress as the potential basis for any
future changes to the law without embracing the details of any one
plan. Bush did not say whether he would raise the Social Security
retirement age to lower the program's costs, although he said
people who are retired or near retirement would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore, speaking at Beaver College in Amblin, Pa.,
accused Bush of risking the economic security of retirees by
placing Social Security tax dollars in a volatile stock market. He
has said women, minorities, and the disabled would be hurt most by
Bush's proposed changes in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners
and losers, we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too
many Americans and in the end we will all have to pay to make up
the differences,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds
appealing,'' he continued. ``But in reality, the Bush Social
Security privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine
the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically explosive, Social Security has long been a subject
that candidates stayed away from, other than to profess their
undying commitment. This year, the Bush campaign is gambling that
younger voters will be attracted by the prospect of investing some
of their own money for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush did not say how much money he would allow workers to
invest, his advisers have mentioned it could be 2 percent of the
12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax. Larry Lindsey, Bush's
economic adviser, said the increased return would also make up for
the impending loss of money in the Social Security trust fund as
the baby boom generation retires and fewer people are left to
finance their monthly government checks. Lindsey said that extra
pay-off would also help close the nearly $1 trillion gap that would
occur by diverting payroll taxes from the trust fund into private
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security administration recently announced that the
system will be solvent until 2037, up slightly from previous
predictions because of the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was greeted Monday by a smattering of protesters and an
airplane dragging a misspelled sign that said ``Don't Privatize
Social Security.'' The two campaigns pushed their economic advisers
out front to boost or denounce the competing approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Besides laying out his vision for Social Security, the Texas
governor also used his speech to assail Gore for failing to address
the looming crisis in Social Security and to refute some of Gore's
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mocked Gore for calling his plan ``risky,'' and he said the
vice president wants to pass the problem on to future generations.
He said keeping the current system solvent without changes such as
Gore suggests, by some estimates, could require as much as a 25
percent increase in income taxes or a sharp cut in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent
proposes a band-aid approach,'' Bush said. ``He says, `If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.' But in the lifetime of some people in this
room, it will be broke, and we must fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to use the budget surplus to continue paying
down the national debt and use the interest saved from debt
reduction to shore up the Social Security trust fund, extending the
financial stability of the program until 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said it is unfair for people with the means to invest
in the stock market to limit the freedom of others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore, who calls these bipartisan proposals risky, has a
substantial amount of his money invested in the stock market,''
Bush said. ``If he is building his own retirement security in the
market, why does he object to young Americans doing the same?''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, however, said the vice president has no money
of his own in the stock market, though he once oversaw a trust fund
for his mother that includes stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore said he encourages people to save for retirement
with IRA and 401(k) accounts. But he said those should be in
addition to basic Social Security payments, not as a substitute.

   JERUSALEM _ Underscoring escalating tensions over the peace
process, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police fought gun battles
Monday even as Prime Minister Ehud Barak narrowly won parliamentary
approval to transfer three Jerusalem suburbs to Palestinian
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst oubreak of violence in four years, at least three
Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers and another 300
were wounded during rock-throwing demonstrations that deteriorated
into open gun battles between Israeli and Palestinian security
forces in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. At least 11 Israeli
soldiers were also wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes appeared fueled by anger over the slow pace of the
peace process and Israel's refusal to release 1,650 Palestinians
held in Israeli jails. Palestinians regard them as political
prisoners, while Israel says they were jailed for security
offenses. Hundreds of the prisoners are on the 15th day of a liquid
fast to demand their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators congregated at intersections where Israeli
military checkpoints mark the boundaries of Palestinians'
self-ruled areas and hurled molotov cocktails and burned tires as
helmeted Israeli soldiers fired back with tear gas and
rubber-coated metal bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the West Bank, Palestinian police on rooftops
and in the crowd opened fire on Israeli soldiers, who shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is peace? Peace means no soldiers on the road, peace
means no more Palestinians in prison,'' said Ali Ismail Abu Subah,
a 28-year-old watching the protests in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   The violence Monday, which also was the Palestinian day of
mourning on the anniversary of the founding of Israel 52 years ago,
took place as the Knesset, Israel's parliament, narrowly approved a
decision by the cabinet to transfer more land to Palestinian
self-rule, in a step that could give a much-needed boost to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at one of the most important junctions for the future
of the country and its people,'' Barak told the Knesset in a speech
frequently interrupted by hecklers. ``The peace process with the
Palestinians has reached the point of critical decision and we are
prepared to take historic steps.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 56-to-48 vote, with one abstention, may come at a high
political cost to Barak, who had to rely on the votes of three
small Arab parties and two leftist parties outside his coalition to
get the decision approved.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's decision to go ahead with his plans to transfer the
three suburbs bordering Jerusalem could mark the beginning of the
end of his broad-based coalition government, which has often feuded
over how to proceed with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   One partner in the coalition, the National Religious Party,
which represents Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza, said it
will pull out rather than support the land transfer, and former
Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky said he may take his party out as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties, along with the Orthodox Shas party, either
refused to take part in the vote or opposed the transfer. If the
National Religious Party and Sharansky's Yisrael B'Aliyah party go
ahead with their threat, Barak will be left with a minority
government.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister made a final plea in parliament to his
coalition partners, reminding them that the villages slated to be
transferred to full Palestinian control were already under
Palestinian civil rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing the status (of these villages) does not seriously
change anything in the field, because the areas are already under
Palestinian civil control, and from a security perspective as well,
there is no danger,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in another attempt to keep his coalition intact, the
prime minister's office said the handover of the land would be
delayed until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gave an explanation
for the violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over the three suburbs _ Abu Dis, Azzariye, and
Sawahreh _ is in effect a fight over perceptions of what sort of
final agreement Barak intends to make with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The three towns border Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its
indivisible capital. But East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war, and Palestinians demand that it be turned
over to them to become the capital of their hoped-for independent
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barak's own coalition members, as well as many in the
opposition, said that giving the Palestinians the three suburbs
will open the way for the eventual division of Jerusalem, something
Barak has repeatedly said he will not allow.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the difficulties Barak faces in moving ahead
with the peace process as the two sides try to reach a final
agreement by September 13, thousands of Israelis demonstrated in
downtown Jerusalem against transferring any more land to
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Amid banners accusing the Palestinians of not living up to their
commitments under past peace accords, opposition politicians and
activists told the crowd that Barak had gone too far by agreeing to
turn over more land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to say that we don't want to commit suicide, that
we can't give the Palestinians a state,'' activist Nadia Matar told
the crowd. ``Look at the violence that is happening today. It is
suicide to give the Palestinians land.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties Barak faced in bringing the land transfer to a
vote _ he delayed it for weeks while he struggled to win the
support of his coalition _ is a reflection of the problems the
peace process has faced over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were supposed
to culminate last week in an outline for a final peace deal, but
the talks have stalled over the question of how much land the
Palestinians would receive for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Ross, the United States' Middle East envoy, was expected
to arrive in Israel Monday night to help the two sides embark on
another round of talks.

`PROUST'S WAY':   ON A JOURNEY IN WHICH FLAWS CAN LIGHT THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcel Proust, he of the little madeleines and the long
sentences and the redeeming power of memory, is not the Marcel
Proust of this intellectually powerful, deeply considered
evaluation by Roger Shattuck, the highly esteemed scholar of French
literary culture. Shattuck writes about the Proust beyond the
standard image. His new book, aptly titled ``Proust's Way: A Field
Guide to `In Search of Lost Time,''' learnedly guides the reader,
familiar with Proust or not, into the deeper moral and
philosophical dimensions of the writer.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Shattuck's argument comes in two chapters titled
``Proust's Complaint'' and ``Proust's Binoculars: Memory and
Recognition,'' the sort of capaciously penetrating literary
criticism rarely seen these days. Shattuck's main purpose in these
chapters is to identify the themes that unite Proust's oceanic
comedy of French manners. Beforehand, he fills in the background on
Proust's novel _ whose title Shattuck translates as ``In Search of
Lost Time'' rather than the better known ``A Remembrance of Things
Past'' _ that any reader would need to follow his argument.
</P>
<P>
   Proust, sickly, sensitive, preternaturally aware, began writing
``Search'' when he was 35, having lived his life on the fringes of
fin de siecle high French society. Shattuck cites unflattering
critical judgments on Proust from the likes of Aldous Huxley and
Henry James to the effect that Proust's style was slack to the
point of incoherence and that his novel never transcended the
decadence and ennui that it describes. Shattuck, prefiguring the
themes that he will develop later, declares Proust ``guilty _ but
not as charged.'' Traits like ``snobbery, megalomania, boredom,
aestheticism, and instability of character'' do loom large in
``Search,'' but to understand Proust's greatness, he avers, one has
to understand ``the role they are assigned in a remarkably coherent
work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   If one knows anything at all about ``In Search of Lost Time,''
it would be that it is about the intense power of a certain kind of
memory _ the memory that the aging Marcel experiences when he dips
a madeleine into a cup of linden tea and the taste unexpectedly
restores the lost feelings of his youth at his aunt's country house
at Combray.
</P>
<P>
   For Shattuck, ``Search'' is about memory but is vastly richer in
themes and insights than that. In ``Proust's Complaint,'' for
example, he probes what Proust called an ``infirmity in my
nature,'' and what Shattuck calls ``this distressing perverseness
that dogs the most enterprising activities of the human mind and
seems to deprive it of satisfaction.'' The infirmity is the nasty
psychological law by which experience falls short of our
expectations of it, the existence of a kind of barrier between
perception and reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is, as Shattuck acknowledges, no more than the cliche that
the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. But Proust
elaborated on that cliche more than any other writer, he contends,
and his elaboration produced a masterpiece that is more comic than
tragic, more vibrant than sad. Marcel, who is both a character in
Proust's novel and one of its narrators, makes strenuous efforts to
satisfy his ambition and then loses interest just when he seems
about to succeed. Shattuck's assessment of one of Proust's more
famous scenes, when the young Marcel finally succeeds in kissing
Albertine, the chief object of his desire, brings this point home
to great effect. ``When he kisses Albertine, he confronts 10
Albertines, no one of whom he desires,'' Shattuck writes. ``Marcel
carries a pall wherever he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck gives this theme historical resonance by tracing
Marcel's particular kind of self-doubt back to Montaigne, who three
centuries before Proust wrote: ``I attach too little value to
things I possess, just because I possess them.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust in this sense is a chronicler not so much of social mores
as of the universal human condition, manifested in Marcel's
paralysis in the face of what he most desires. Shattuck, drawing on
an impressive degree of erudition, shows some of the sources of
Proust's deliberation on these deep flaws in human nature, and he
links those flaws to another concept, which Proust called
``intermittence,'' the inability of people to be all of themselves
at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Search' as a whole seeks not to transcend that condition
but to encompass it,'' Shattuck writes. ``The book becomes oceanic
in scale in order to contain the changing weathers and tides and
crosscurrents of a long voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Proust's narrator arrives, in Shattuck's view, at a
kind of wise tolerance. ``Fully understood as part of our lot,
Proust's complaint leads not to despair but to a gentle smile at
the vagaries of human persons and at the time it takes us to
recognize ourselves for what we are,'' Shattuck writes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Proust's Binoculars'' Shattuck traces a complicated
argument showing how the visual imagery in ``Search'' relates to
Proust's underlying concept of perception. Error of perception is
the critical concept in Shattuck's analysis. He leads the reader
through a series of literary byways to his belief that ``Search''
is less about memory than it is about what Shattuck calls
``recognition,'' specifically Marcel's recognition of himself as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complex shuffling and sorting out of images that we call
`recognizing' a person arises from the reality of disappearing
selves, of death,'' Shattuck writes. ``The perpetual menace of
death, instead of discouraging Marcel, spurs him on anew toward his
`urgent, capital rendezvous with himself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck's arguments are sophisticated and subtle and not always
easy to follow. One reads certain passages and then one rereads
them to sift their meaning. The effort produces ample rewards.
Shattuck leaves us not only with a deepened appreciation of
Proust's great work but of all great literature as well, because in
the deepest sense he has done what all literary criticism strives
to do: he has taught us how to read.

GREENSPAN FACES MOST DIFFICULT JUDGMENT CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, in his meeting Tuesday
with central bank policy makers to set interest rates, faces the
most difficult test of his remarkable career at the Fed: can he
ensure that the nation's longest economic expansion continues?
</P>
<P>
   Most economists expect Greenspan to boost interest rates by a
half point, continuing a campaign begun last summer to rid the
economy of inflationary tendencies. A few economists returned to
earlier predictions of a quarter-point hike after the newest batch
of economic indicators, released last week, showed wholesale prices
dropped and retail sales slowed.
</P>
<P>
   But while the world focuses on how much rates will rise,
economists said members of the Federal Open Market Committee,
headed by Greenspan, are focused on the policy dilemmas involved in
deciding how much to increase rates.
</P>
<P>
   A big hike in rates could further unsettle financial markets,
causing stocks to tumble and making it more difficult for the Fed
to engineer a smooth landing. But if the Fed does too little, the
market might soar or the economy might continue to barrel along,
unleashing inflation which has creeped up but has not yet entered
the ``red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed's goal of maintaining price stability is very much at
risk here,'' said Allen Sinai, president of Primark Decision
Economics, a Boston consulting firm. ``Finding the exact amount and
doling it out, with the right timing, is harder than the choices
the Fed has had to deal with in most of the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy dilemmas are in addition to the unique concerns
posed by an election year, as was true in the early 1990s when
tight monetary policy was blamed for the incumbent party's loss of
the presidency when Republican George H. Bush was defeated by a
Democrat, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, the Fed has raised interest rates five times _
a quarter-point each time _ in an attempt to cool the economy. Fed
policy makers will be concerned that the pace of economic growth,
which accelerated to a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the fourth
quarter of last year, continued at a strong 5.4 percent annual rate
in the first quarter of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The economy continued to expand in April when 340,000 jobs were
created, in addition to 458,000 jobs in March. Two strong months
drove the April unemployment down to 3.9 percent _ it was the first
time the rate had fallen below 4 percent since January 1970. In
April, new data released Monday showed that US industrial
production of goods ranging from cars to computers rose at its
strongest pace in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   Such unrelenting growth, economists said, require tough action
and a half-point increase to keep wages and inflation in check. ``I
think it'll be a half (point),'' predicted Nicholas Perna, an
economic consultant in Richfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Yamarone, an economist for Argus Research Corp., an
independent research firm based in New York, argued that a
quarter-point hike would be more prudent, because it is too early
to tell whether prior Fed rates have begun ``to work through the
system'' and slow economic growth. There is typically a 9- to
24-month lag before a rate hike fully impacts the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed rate hikes _ the five _ have not had a chance or
opportunity'' to work, Yamarone said. ``There's an old adage
expansions don't die. The Fed kills them. I don't think Greenspan
really wants to go in with both barrels ablazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp. in Boston,
shied from guessing what the Fed would do. But he said Greenspan
needs to ensure the stability of the nation's financial markets is
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, at all-time highs, has been in a precarious
position for weeks. The Nasdaq Composite index of technology stocks
has plunged nearly 30 percent from its March high and has displayed
acute volatility. Yet, market analysts argue that the Nasdaq _ and
probably the Dow _ are well above levels justified by corporate
earnings or economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq rose 2.2 percent Monday, or 78.62 points, to 3607.68,
though the tech-stock index for the year has lost more than 11
percent this year. The Dow, which is down 6 percent this year,
gained 1.87 percent Monday, or 198.41 points, closing at 10,807.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't markets that have traded well over the past two
months and could do less well over the coming two months. For the
Fed to have contributed to that or perceived to have contributed to
that would not be desirable,'' Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Breimyer, Perna and other economists stressed what is most
important is that the Fed clearly state its goals in the statement
that will accompany the latest announcement about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong statement would be that they're going to do this
until the economy shows signs of slowing,'' Perna said, because
``the last thing they want is to suggest'' is Tuesday's rate hike
might be the last. ``That would give them a big rally in stocks
which they don't want and don't need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed's ultimate goal is stanching inflation _ not
coddling financial markets. While inflation is still far below
levels that had caused worry in past economic expansions, it has
creeped up. The consumer price index rose 0.7 percent in March,
producing a 3.7 percent inflation rate for the past year. That is
more than a point above inflation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sinai said anecdotal evidence of inflation has become pervasive,
from 10 percent to 15 percent increases in ice cream prices on
Martha's Vineyard to recent surveys showing companies and consumers
are anticipation higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrong thing may well be not doing enough,'' Sinai said
about the Fed action. ``Even though we're at a very low rate,
inflation is on the march.''
</P>
<P>
   While economists differ on the fine points of how to conduct
monetary policy, none said Monday that Greenspan's decision would
be an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   Fed members ``are trying to exit themselves from the situation
gracefully _ the word gracefully should not be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to a judgment call, he added _ Greenspan's
judgment.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Paul Kellogg became the artistic and general
director of the New York City Opera in 1996, the company was
carrying a $5 million debt, had lost its sense of artistic
direction and was coping emotionally with the death from AIDS of
its previous director, the conductor Christopher Keene.
</P>
<P>
   Revitalizing the City Opera was going to be a formidable
challenge. And the greatest impediment to doing so, in fundamental
ways, was the New York State Theater itself, the City Opera's home
since 1965, which is shared with the New York City Ballet.
Rehearsal space and administrative offices had always been woefully
inadequate there.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem Kellogg confronted was the poor acoustics
of the 2,700-seat auditorium. Two earlier attempts to correct the
problem with minor architectural adjustments had not appreciably
improved the sound in the house. In exasperation, Kellogg, with the
support of the City Ballet, finally approved the installation of an
electronic sound enhancement system before the opening of the
season last fall, surely the most controversial decision of his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Natural sound has been a hallmark of the classical music
heritage, and there are few places left in the world, other than
opera houses and concerts halls, where audiences can experience
music without the sound being processed electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But Kellogg maintains that the sound system has been an enormous
success over all. Without exception, he asserts, the company's
music staff, orchestra players and singers support its use. And the
vast majority of City Opera audiences either strongly approve, he
says, basing his observations on feedback and mail he has received,
or at least are not bothered by it.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Kellogg vigorously defended his
decision to resort to an electronic solution for the house's poor
acoustics. Yet he also indicated for the first time that the system
was an ``interim solution'' for a problem that he hopes will be
solved architecturally by a major renovation of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are under way about renovations of the entire
Lincoln Center complex. A major redesign of the State Theater
auditorium to improve the acoustics is on the table, though the
project could easily be derailed by the sheer expense involved,
which could exceed $30 million for the State Theater alone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the auditorium is a historic and justly acclaimed
space for dance. The City Ballet, which actually prefers to
minimize sound from the stage, has more interest in preserving it
as is.
</P>
<P>
   If the renovation plan does not come to pass, Kellogg stated
unequivocally, the company will find ``another solution.'' He
refused to specify what that might entail, but the only apparent
solution would be to move the company to a site outside Lincoln
Center. That idea was raised unofficially by Kellogg's exasperated
predecessors. Such a move would be Kellogg's boldest stroke by far,
challenging the idea of the urban arts complex.
</P>
<P>
   What Kellogg mostly wanted to talk about during the interview
was good news about the company's current finances and artistic
strength. The City Opera is thriving, and he has compiled the facts
and figures to back his case. Debt has been erased, and the company
now boasts a $12 million endowment. Fund-raising is up 50 percent
since 1996. The operating budget has increased some $5 million over
the same period, to $31 million for the 1999-2000 season, which
ended three weeks ago. In the last year attendance has increased by
10 percent: this season the company sold an average of 83 percent
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? Soon after arriving, Kellogg announced a
three-year revitalization plan with specific goals. Because the
Metropolitan Opera was right across the plaza at Lincoln Center, it
was essential, he felt, that City Opera distinguish itself by
performing repertory the Met was not known for, especially Baroque
operas and 20th-century American works. Even when the City Opera
presents the staples _ ``Carmen,'' ``Tosca'' and such _ it should
do so, he believes, in innovative modern productions that contrast
with the Met's grand traditionalism in the standard repertory.
</P>
<P>
   If the City Opera could not afford to hire renowned vocalists
for, say, ``Madama Butterfly,'' then it should present casts of
fresh-voiced, younger singers who looked like the characters they
were portraying and were strong actors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every aspect of Kellogg's vision for the company was
contingent on making the house more acoustically vibrant. If
attractive singers with young voices were going to flourish there,
the sound in the auditorium had to become more alive. If Baroque
operas were going to be presented effectively, and if audiences new
to opera were going to be attracted to it, then the house had to be
made to feel more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, so many people complained about the acoustics of
the State Theater, its unfriendliness to young voices, the dryness
and unevenness of the sound in the house,'' Kellogg said. The press
complained continually, he added. The company had to find an
interim solution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, until recently, the idea that the sound system might
become a permanent feature of even a renovated State Theater was
very much alive. When the system was installed, Kellogg asked wary
critics and audiences for a grace period. He promised to present a
demonstration for critics and patrons to hear just how subtly, in
his opinion, the system worked. Excerpts from operas would be
performed with the system switched off and on. That demonstration
has never occurred, he conceded, citing the expense involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall he also said that once the system was installed and
fine-tuned, the controls and levels would be set and never tampered
with. It was important, he felt, that the State Theater have a
distinctive house sound.

BABY (Phoenix) - A jury on Monday found for two doctors who had
been accused of failing to diagnose a Phoenix woman's pregnancy
before it was too late for her to have an abortion. The nine-member
jury, comprised of seven men and two women, deliberated for about
30 minutes before rendering their decision. Ruth Ann Burns was
suing Dr. Leroy Kareus, Burns' family physician, and Dr. David
Kaufman, her obstetrician, for failing to detect and date the
pregnancy of her now 2-year-old son, Nicholas, in time to have an
abortion. By REPUBLIC STAFF. Story will move in the `A` and `L`

GRAZING (Undated) - In a unanimous decision affecting thousands of
Arizona ranchers and millions of acres of federal lands across the
West, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld livestock-grazing regulations
imposed in 1995 by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Among the
changes: Environmental groups like Forest Guardians may now compete
for grazing bids, and if they win, not put any cattle on the land.
Ranchers also will not be automatically re-issued grazing leases
every 10 years, a move they say could keep banks from granting them
loans. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the `A` category. &QL;

 NEW YORK: house sound. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even at the Met, with its quite good acoustics, the house
sound varies from production to production, mostly depending on the
size and placement of sets. Wouldn't it be impossible for
technicians at the State Theater to resist fiddling with the
controls from night to night? If the capability exists, it is human
nature to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, not only has daily tinkering become commonplace,
Kellogg conceded, but on some nights the system has been turned off
completely, he said, though no announcements were made to the press
and public. This put audiences, but especially critics who are
expected to offer informed evaluations, in an impossible situation.
Can we trust what we are hearing?
</P>
<P>
   That singers and musicians apparently support the sound system
is not really surprising. Why shouldn't they take advantage of
electronic assistance in an acoustically unfriendly house? That
audiences have largely embraced it is also to be expected.
Amplification has become pervasive, and the younger audiences the
company is attracting, having grown up with electronic sound, are
unlikely even to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, no matter what, people are going to complain
about the sound in this house,'' Kellogg said. ``This system is a
way of solving the problem on an interim basis. The audience is not
reacting, for the most part, on a matter of principle. Nor am I.''
Critics can ``wring their hands as much as they like,'' he added.
``It works for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders, even among critics, argue that there is a difference
between real amplification, typical today in Broadway theaters
where singers wear body microphones, and systems that enhance the
acoustical properties of a hall itself. But whatever labels are
coined to describe the equipment, voices are still being picked up
by microphones, carried through wires and disseminated through
dozens, even hundreds, of tiny speakers that cover the walls.
</P>
<P>
   And just as on Broadway, the use of sound systems in opera and
concert music will eventually affect the way singers sing,
musicians play, audiences hear and composers write. Kellogg
maintains that the State Theater system ``allows voices to be heard
as they really are,'' and that it ``does not make a small voice
large or an ugly voice pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not convinced, nor are some other critics, and at least a
vocal minority of audience members. Because of the enhancement
system, certain sounds _ a soprano's sustained, full-voiced high
notes, for example _ are almost always piercingly present. Some
sounds get oddly emphasized. During a recent performance of Virgil
Thomson's ``Mother of Us All,'' the opera sounded at times like a
concerto for snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we have this adventurous and increasingly essential
company to thank for finally bringing us the first production ever
by a major New York opera house of Thomson's great American opera,
as well as many other important works, like Rameau's ``Platee'' in
the imaginative production by Mark Morris (which sold 95 percent of
the house in six performances). Next season come other rarities and
treats, like Prokofiev's ``Love of Three Oranges'' and Handel's
``Rinaldo'' with the splendid countertenor David Daniels in the
title role.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg readily agreed that there was ``no substitute for a
house whose good acoustics are architectural.'' He hopes this can
be achieved at the State Theater. It falls to critics, then, to
point out the shortcomings of the current system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week the company presented ``Showcasing American Composers
2000,'' an invaluable contribution to the city's cultural life and
the future of American opera. Over a period of two weeks, excerpts
of roughly 25 minutes each from 12 American operas, either
works-in-progress or existing operas that have yet to be produced,
were performed in open readings with a full orchestra and strong
vocal soloists at the Great Hall of Cooper Union.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive year that these free performances
were presented. The rehearsal schedule was tight but sufficient to
give the composers, interested singers and operagoers and, most
important, potential producers a good sense of the various works.
That Kellogg and his company secured funds for this important
project demonstrates how fully they are committed to the future of
American opera. The Met has done nothing remotely as helpful to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   That the City Opera's showcase was taking place off-site,
downtown, not far from the home of the most famous organization to
bolt Lincoln Center, Joseph Papp's Public Theater, seemed
significant. What other bold ventures could the newly energized
City Opera undertake if it could just scrap that sound system and
fix up its house, or, maybe even get out of Lincoln Center and
start afresh?

LYCOS MERGER RUMORS BOOST STOCK PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in Lycos Inc. rose 12 percent Monday on expectations the
Internet company may merge with the Internet unit of Spanish
telephone giant Telefonica SA.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's Terra Networks confirmed Friday it is in
discussions with Lycos to create a global Internet portal, though
executives cautioned no deal is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would elaborate Monday,  &UR; al &LR; though reports in
the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous
sources as saying Lycos was also considering selling itself
outright to Terra Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' sites are the fourth most popular on the Internet, but
analysts say the Waltham, Mass. company in danger of becoming an
also-ran in the battle for online eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended Jan. 31, Lycos posted a net loss of
$31 million on revenue of $68.6 million. Lately, it has struck
partnerships with a plethora of online banks, car dealers and music
providers in an effort to extend its reach with relatively little
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But while those efforts have been applauded by analysts, Lycos
has gained little ground among Internet users since a year ago,
when shareholder opposition forced it to abandon a plan to merge
with Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lycos's rivals have expanded their market reach.
About 59.8 million users visited America Online and its affiliated
sites in March, up from 47 million a year earlier, according to the
MediaMetrix firm in New York. Meanwhile, Lycos sites attracted
about 32.9 million unique visitors in March, up from 32.3 million a
year earlier, MediaMetrix reported.
</P>
<P>
   Terra is best known for its Spanish-language content and could
extend its offerings with the English material that Lycos could
supply from Waltham, from its West Coast properties such as Wired
News, and from its Lycos Europe division.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal Monday reported that Lycos is seeking a
price of at least $90 a share from Terra, citing unidentified
sources. That would be a steep premium over the $61.625 at which
Lycos stock closed in Nasdaq trading Monday. The stock was up $7.50
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow Lycos and said they would likely support a
deal with Terra as an exit strategy. Lycos lacks the cash available
to America Online and Yahoo, and may have to sell out eventually,
said Larry Haverty, analyst at State Street Research. He said he
doesn't own shares in Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strategy standpoint, they have to do something,''
Haverty said of Lycos. ``They could survive, but eventually the
stock valuation would decline'' as its competitors continue to pull
away.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Moran, analyst for Jeffries &AMP; Co., said shareholders might
be more inclined to support a deal based on a specific valuation of
Lycos' shares, in contrast to last year's proposal from USA
Networks. That proposal did not specify a premium for Lycos shares.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with Telefonica might also need the blessing of Lycos'
largest shareholder, CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., and its chief
executive David Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell initially backed the agreement with USA Networks but
reversed course after shareholders bid down Lycos' stock by nearly
a third. Wetherell also quit the Lycos board and CMGI has since
reduced its stake in Lycos, to around 16 percent from 22 percent at
the start of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI remains the company's single largest investor, followed by
Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments, according to filings
to the US Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a CMGI spokesman declined to comment on Lycos' talks
with the Spanish company and said Wetherell and other CMGI
executives hadn't even been briefed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the sidelines,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Diller still believes a deal with USA Networks would have been
better for Lycos shareholders in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we came out with that same transaction today, there would
be applause,'' he said at a conference in New York last week.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TALK COMPROMISE ON `GUN-SHOW' LOOPHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the ``Million Mom March'' participants filed out
of Washington Monday after rallying for gun-control laws, there
were fresh signs that a 10-month congressional deadlock on a
pending bill might be broken, but little prospect that the larger
goal of universal gun registration would be achieved anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the march, key congressional leaders discussed a
possible compromise Monday on how to close the ``gun-show
loophole'' that allows people to buy handguns without the kind of
background check required at gun stores.
</P>
<P>
   But there remained little support for the top goal of march
leaders, to require licensing and registration of all handguns,
including the 60 million already in circulation. Even Vice
President Al Gore, who hopes to benefit politically from the march,
supports licensing only for owners of newly purchased handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of political support for what march organizer Donna
Dees-Thomases has called her ``ultimate goal'' shows how far the
Million Mom March movement has to go, even after the impressive
start on Sunday, when 500,000 or more marchers filled the National
Mall. March organizers said Monday that their effort will be
transformed into a gun-control lobbying group and urged mothers to
become active in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant action sought by the marchers is spelled
out in their petition: ``We call on Congress to require all handgun
owners to be licensed and that they be required to register their
weapons with the proper authorities. It makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little movement toward that goal in Congress. Texas
Governor George W. Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee,
opposes such a measure. During the Democratic primaries, former
Senator Bill Bradley took the strongest position on gun control,
calling for the registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Million Mom March goes beyond the Gore proposal and is
actually closer to the Bradley proposal,'' said David Bernstein, a
spokesman for Handgun Control Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether the march will provide a turning
point for gun control and for candidates who espouse the group's
goals. As the Million Mom March prepares to transform itself into a
lobby, it is preparing to go up against one of the best-financed
and most powerful such organizations in Washington, the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Million Mom March could provide incentive
for Congress to break the deadlock on gun legislation now stalled
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened this weekend is very important,'' said Sam
Stratman, a spokesman for House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry
Hyde of Illinois. ``A large number of Americans spoke with one
voice, and it will helpfully focus a good number of legislators on
reaching a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Gore casting the tie-breaking vote, the Senate
passed legislation that would require background checks of
prospective purchasers at gun shows from unlicensed dealers,
eliminating what has become known as the ``gun-show loophole.'' The
House passed a weaker version of the measure, adopting a one-day
background check, which the Justice Department has said is too
little time to conduct an adequate investigation in a small but
significant numbers of cases. The difference between the House and
Senate bills must be decided in a conference committee, but the
panel has not met since August.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who heads the House side of the conference committee, last
Friday made a significant compromise, proposing that a one-day
waiting period be extended in certain cases deemed necessary by law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted President Clinton to say Monday that Hyde and the
ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Representative
John Conyers of Michigan, are making ``some real progress to
resolve the impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Conyers: ``Hyde and I are getting closer, but it is not
clear to me where that leaves the measure itself'' with the GOP
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the Hyde proposal is still
``riddled with loopholes.'' Nonetheless, Kennedy said the march had
a tremendous impact on Congress. ``This institution isn't really
going to be the same after yesterday,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats believe Bush is vulnerable on the gun issue
because he secured passage of legislation in Texas that allows
people to carry concealed weapons. But the governor on Friday
sought to soften his image on guns, announcing a Texas program to
provide free gun-safety locks that he wants to institute
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is counting on strong support from women in his
presidential bid, especially those who favor gun control and are
sympathetic to the goals of the Million Mom March. But Gore also is
wary of offending gun owners who oppose the gun laws proposed
during the march.

GIULIANI SAGA REMAINS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news from City Hall was that there was no news.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for the hordes of reporters, the hordes of advisers
whose paychecks are on the line, the hordes of Republican
officeholders whose reelections are tied to his coattails, and the
hordes of observers across the state _ many with vested interests,
more just curious _ it was just another impatient day of waiting
for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Will he dash all caution, setting aside worries about his
prostate cancer, his shattered marriage, his affair with another
woman, and continue his run for the US Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton? Or will he decide the pressures are too great, the
medical treatments too onerous, and pull out?
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd of reporters and 21 TV cameras squeezed into the
Blue Room at City Hall Monday for the mayor's daily ``press
availability.'' Aides had said earlier that nothing big would
happen, but nobody was taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani walked into the room a little after noon, smiling and
shaking his head. By the time he got to the podium, he burst out
laughing, and said, ``I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I have no
major announcement to make today.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a few bits of news. He would not be going to California
for a fund-raiser. At the same time, a nationally televised town
hall interview scheduled for Thursday night in Manhattan was, at
least for the moment, still on. And he suggested he would make the
big decision sometime this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He flatly denied a report in Monday's Newsweek that he has
decided to drop out of the Senate race and undergo an operation and
then radiation treatment to wipe out his cancer. Those treatments,
together, would take three months, longer than a Senate campaign
could tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report in Newsweek is just absolutely false,'' he said
Monday. He insisted he has not yet decided on the course of
treatment, and said until that question is settled, he would try
not even to think about his political future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's disclosures about his personal life gave him less
time than he thought he would have to consult with doctors. So, he
added, ``I'm going to need to do that this week _ tomorrow, the
next day, I don't know, you can't put a time frame on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Another remark suggested his decision will come in the next two
days. Noting that he needs time for medical consultations, he said,
``Tomorrow and the next day, I will probably have a much-reduced
schedule'' for work and campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Republican leaders and fund-raising organizers
were not pressuring him to hurry up. ``They're more patient than
all of you are,'' he told the roomful of reporters, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is well known that the state's Republicans are getting
nervous, with opinion divided on whether it would be better for
Giuliani to go ahead or withdraw. All, however, agree that a
definite candidate is needed soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is holding its state convention in Albany
Tuesday, where Mrs. Clinton will be officially declared the
candidate amid great fanfare. She was endorsed Monday by a
builders' union that usually endorses Republicans. The polls still
show her running neck-and-neck with Giuliani, but with her numbers
rising and the mayor's falling, especially in New York City and
upstate. In the suburbs, the mayor still holds a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party holds its convention May 30.

&HT;     COURT DENIES RAPE VICTIMS RIGHT TO SUE ATTACKERS IN FEDERAL
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that rape victims
cannot sue their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   It struck down a provision in a 1994 federal law allowing such
lawsuits, saying that Congress, in passing the measure, had
overstepped its bounds and reached into an area reserved for the
states.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotly disputed 5-4 decision in a Virginia case, the court
invalidated the part of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that
authorized victims of gender-related violence to seek civil damages
in federal court rather than rely solely on state prosecutors and
juries.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled against Christy Brzonkala, a former student
at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., who had filed the suit against
two school football players after alleging that they had raped her
in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement saying
he is ``deeply disappointed'' that victims of such crimes may no
longer sue in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I continue to believe that there should be remedies
for victims of gender-motivated violence, we plan to study the
Supreme Court's decision ... to determine the best means to help
these victims,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which
</P>
<P>
   represented Brzonkala, said, ``I consider this to be a severe
blow for women's rights because of the chilling effect it will have
on Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers added that ``Congress identified a kind of gender
discrimination. Congress is trying to address that with a creative,
specific solution, and the court says, `No, you can't do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Michael E. Rosman, who argued the case on behalf of
the two football players, called the decision a ``victory'' for the
Constitution. ``If we had lost, it would have opened the floodgates
to federal intervention in almost any crime,'' he said, adding that
``every crime has an economic impact of some kind or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law after hearing charges that state courts
were not doing enough to protect women from violence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers cited Congress' constitutional power to regulate
interstate commerce as a basis for passing the act. They said
gender-motivated violence was related to interstate commerce
because victims were often unable to work for long periods and cost
the nation $3 billion to $5 billion a year in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court said Monday that the lawsuit provision of
the law would open the door to federal intervention in many areas
traditionally under the control of the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
</P>
<P>
   national and what is truly local,'' Chief Justice William H.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' argument ``would allow (it) to regulate any crime as
long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has
substantial effects on employment, production, transit or
consumption,'' Rehnquist said. ``Indeed, if Congress may regulate
gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or
any other type of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who sponsored the Violence Against
Women Act, said he did not know what would happen to the rest of
the law. ``The court really went off here in a way that I find
extremely troublesome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Souter cited ``the mountain of data
assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce. ... Violence against women may be
found to affect interstate commerce substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   The case dates from 1995, when Brzonkala said football players
Antonio Morrison and James Crawford raped her in a dormitory room
when she was a freshman at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brzonkala did not report the incident, which allegedly
occurred in September 1994, for nearly seven months. When a grand
jury convened to examine the allegation, she refused to testify.
The grand jury declined to indict either player.
</P>
<P>
   The players contended that consensual sex had occurred. Crawford
was cleared by a university hearing. Morrison, who admitted that
Brzonkala had told him ``no'' twice before they had sex, was
suspended from school for a year. The charge was later reduced to
``abusive language,'' and the suspension was cut to three months,
which allowed Morrison to continue his football career. Brzonkala,
furious at the outcome, withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995 she filed an $8.3 million civil suit in federal
court against the players and the university under the newly passed
Violence Against Women Act. But before the trial began, U.S.
District Judge Jackson L. Kiser dismissed her case in July 1996. In
March 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in
Richmond, Va., agreed. The law, Judge J. Michael Luttig wrote,
``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles of limited
federal government upon which this nation is founded.''On Monday,
the high court affirmed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote that if Brzonkala's allegations ``are true, no
civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy ...
But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the
commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Congress has used the Constitution's interstate
commerce clause to pass such federal civil rights laws as those
banning discrimination in housing and in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   For several decades, the high court allowed this practice, but
in a 1995 case from San Antonio, the justices said it amounted to
an encroachment of federal power over the states. In that case the
high court invalidated the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which
prohibited possession of firearms near schools, as an improper
infringement on an area of state concern.That decision prompted
lower courts to scrutinize the rationale for other federal laws,
including the lawsuit provision in the Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the constitutional distinction between national
and local matters, Rehnquist said that ``there is no better example
of the police power, which the Founders undeniably left reposed in
the States and denied the central government, than the suppression
of violent crime and vindication of its victims.''

CANNES JOURNAL: NEWS AND NOTES FROM THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More Is Less (Or Is That Vice Versa?) at Film Fest
</P>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ It seems that taxi drivers are the same all
over the world, taking hairpin turns as if they were driving in the
Indianapolis 500 _ or, here, the Grand Prix in Monaco _ and
subjecting passengers to unsolicited opinions. When one driver
overheard muttering about the ride's resemblance to the Joel and
Ethan Coen film ``The Big Lebowski,'' in which a surly cabby
literally tosses a passenger out of the car for objecting to his
taste, he smiled and joined in the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My English is catastrophic,'' he said, and then mentioned his
love of that movie and the Coens. ``They will be here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a film with George Clooney in the competition,'' he
volunteered cheerily, referring to the Coens' period comedy, ``O
Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and highlighting a difference between
Cannes and most other cities.
</P>
<P>
   For the two weeks or so of the Cannes International Film
Festival, this city becomes obsessed with movies and moviemakers
who are equally obsessed with promoting their films, a situation
that leads to a flood of Americans. Probably the last time such a
large number of Americans were butchering the language on the
beaches of France was during the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The snarl of visitors clogging the Croisette _ the main drag,
where much of the action takes place _ has increased this year as
the number of dot-coms has multiplied. Most of them arrived here
with ``reel'' in their names, like reelshort and reelplay.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike major North American festivals _ New York, Sundance,
Toronto _ Cannes is both a competitive festival and a marketplace.
The onslaught of information can be almost as overwhelming as jet
lag. That leads to perhaps the most pervasive frustration of all
the festivals, since no one could possibly get to all the films.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the scrambling by natives and visitors to hustle
their way into the parties, the last sign of Hollywood flash since
attention-getting schemes like sending elephants down the Croisette
have gone the way of the woolly mastodon. The consensus among
veterans is that there are more films here, but that things are
quieter, with less overt sleaziness and more of a Eurotrash
Sundance vibe.
</P>
<P>
   One festival newcomer is Gene Hackman. When asked how he managed
to avoid attending the festival until now, Hackman grinned and
said: ``Just lucky, I guess. I'm not sure what it does, but ...''
He shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   He's here with ``Under Suspicion,'' in which he stars with
Morgan Freeman. The film is a remake of Claude Miller's French
policier ``Garde a Vue,'' a cat-and-mouse game in which a detective
(Freeman) tries to persuade, or coerce, a confession out of an
assured plutocrat (Hackman). Hackman said he had seen the original
years ago in Los Angeles and had been trying to get it back to the
screen since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to see some other film and walked out of it,'' he
recalled. ``I wish I could remember what we walked out of. That'd
make a great story. We wandered into another theater, and `Garde'
was playing. We missed the first five minutes, so I went back the
next night and then tried to option it after I saw it. But it was
too expensive. They wanted a million dollars for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hackman did get his hands on it, he sent it to Arthur Penn,
who directed him in ``Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust Arthur,'' he said. ``He worked on it with a writer for
a long time. But they couldn't lick it. I'm sorry he couldn't
figure it out to his liking.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later he gave it to Freeman, shortly after they worked
together on ``Unforgiven.'' ``Morgan has an intelligence about him
that makes him a worthy adversary,'' Hackman said, laughing. ``I
told him he could play either role, but I was praying he didn't
want the good part.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackman acknowledged that ``Suspicion'' was different from
``Garde.'' ``Americans don't want subtlety,'' he said. ``So it is
broader, much more class-based. My character has a sense of
entitlement about him, not as physical as other parts I've played
and even a bit of a coward, which I liked about it.`
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Hackman wanted to direct, but it has
passed. ``I realize I don't have the patience,'' he said. ``I can
be a curmudgeon on the set. I like directors who say `faster,
slower, funnier' because I've done the psychological preparation
already, like any actor.''
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing ``Garde,'' he let go of a picture he had planned
to direct and star in, ``Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I owned `Silence,''' he said. ``One of my daughters, who'd
read some other Thomas Harris, read it and said: `You can't do
that, Dad. Hannibal's too gross.' I don't think I really have the
skill to do it either. I got Ted Tally involved, after seeing his
play `Nuts' in Chicago, but eventually I sold it back to Orion.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Damaged Souls
</P>
<P>
   The competition film ``Harry, He's Here to Help'' is reminiscent
of French noirish meditations like ``Garde a Vue'' or those
portraits of the damaged souls of the bourgeoisie made famous by
the director Claude Chabrol, pictures like ``Just Before
Nightfall.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Harry,'' directed by Dominik Moll, Michel (Laurent Lucas)
is a husband and father suffering as he tries to please his wife,
his demanding young daughters and his overbearing lecher of a
father. There's nothing left for himself when Harry (Sergi Lopez),
a successful grade school friend, finds him. Harry's devotion
begins to take unsettling turns, and the long-faced Michel, who
looks like one of the Gallagher brothers from the rock group Oasis,
is disturbed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not, since Lucas' impassivity makes it hard to tell.
The film is bland and predictable when it means to be creepy and
unsettling. There's an unspoken homoerotic vein in Harry's
doggedness that the picture attributes to a crazy streak that is
unexplained, though the bumping off of Michel's loutish dad is a
mercy killing. ``Harry'' is most successful at showing the stresses
of parenthood; Michel's three little girls fight for attention in
the way that children can.
</P>
<P>
   `Lear' in the Desert
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about festival films that is not in
competition is another slap at the middle class, the Dogma film
``The King Is Alive,'' directed by Kristian Levring. Like most
pictures that adhere to the rules of Dogma, the Danish film
movement, people were either drawn to it or repelled by it. The
filmmakers who take on the uniform nonconformity of the Dogma style
of hand-held realism are essentially shooting ``Playhouse 90''
melodramas with a Betacam.
</P>
<P>
   ``King'' is no exception. In the film a busload of tourists,
stranded in an abandoned town in the African desert, try to
distract themselves by staging ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing else quite like ``King'' here. In its way it
seems to be a combination of ``Gilligan's Island'' and ``The Blair
Witch Project'' with elements of ``Shakespeare in Love.'' The
desert setting was almost tailor-made for Dogma, lending itself to
the coarse grain of the high-definition video cameras used to make
these films.
</P>
<P>
   ``King'' is the most visually impressive Dogma work thus far and
has a delirious beauty. Some bits, like a sex scene with the lovers
covered in sand and a shot of Bruce Davison collapsed on a sand
dune, are captivating to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Labor of Love
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread and Roses,'' in competition at the festival, is the
first United States-based film by the British social-realist
director Ken Loach, whose career includes ``Poor Cow'' and ``My
Name Is Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is one of the most difficult places to work,'' Loach said
of the film's setting. ``Everyone has lost their innocence there.
You have to work to keep excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannes'single-mindedness about show business doesn't interest
him. ``I don't know much about the business, so no one talks to me
about who bought whom,'' he said with soft-spoken intensity. He is
amused by the festival, he said, having been here with films six
times.
</P>
<P>
   Mention of ``Bread and Roses,'' which follows the struggle of a
group of immigrant janitorial workers against their exploitative
bosses through the eyes of a Mexican family, also brings a smile to
Loach's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were out there now,'' he said, referring to the
recent janitors' strike in Los Angeles. ``I spent a lot of time
with janitors, going out on marches with them and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which stars Elpidia Carillo and Pilar Padilla as
sisters and Adrien Brody as a firebrand union organizer, could be
this generation's ``Norma Rae.'' The subject intrigued Loach
because of the way he was able to use Hispanic actors, he said,
adding, ``It's about them, instead of them being extras behind
whites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread'' features his trademark empathy and has a potent
integrity. ``You can't help but be touched,'' Loach said. ``This
story and how it fits into the world is all part of a wider
engagement. Otherwise why spend a year of your life on it?''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the two sisters _ beautifully played by
Carillo, who should have been a star years ago, and Padilla _ is
powerful and gives a sense of familial history bigger than the
film's social concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen her before,'' Loach said of Carillo. ``It's
easier that way, because you don't know what they've done. Instead
you're trying to find out who they are, how they listen, the way
they use words.''
</P>
<P>
   Loach's influence can be seen in a whole generation of British
actors like Tim Roth, who has a cameo in ``Bread.'' (His
directorial debut, ``The War Room,'' proudly follows in Loach's
footsteps.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim just came along as a mate,'' Loach said, sheepishly. ``I
don't know about influencing anyone. It's very nice to think
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of ``Poor Cow'' was used for the flashback sequences of the
young Terence Stamp in Steven Soderbergh's 1999 crime story, ``The
Limey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Soderbergh, and he was helpful on this film, suggesting
people for the crew,'' Loach said. He sat back and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange to see that old film again,'' he said, ``hard
to go back. The one you're doing now is a launchpad for the next.
You have to reject the one you've just done and go on to the
next.''

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Lethbridge, Alberta) _ One year after more than
a million Kosovo Albanians fled the Serbian province, North America
is proving to be the world's most welcoming region for refugees who
want to become immigrants. With the weather warming and security
said to be improving in Kosovo, Western European nations and
Australia are pushing, in some cases forcing, 250,000 refugees to
return to their devastated homeland. Germany, with 170,000 Kosovar
refugees, has said it will deport those who refuse a $1,000
incentive to return. But in Canada and the United States,
three-quarters of the Kosovars who came last year have stayed.

   SCOTUS-WOMEN (Washington) _ Declaring that ``the Constitution
requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is
truly local,'' the Supreme Court Monday invalidated a six-year-old
law that permitted victims of rape, domestic violence and other
crimes ``motivated by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal
court. The 5-4 decision striking down the civil remedy provision of
the Violence Against Women Act was the latest, one of the most
sweeping, but almost certainly not the last application of the
court's newly restrictive view of congressional power and of the
degree of deference that Congress is owed by federal courts. By

Palestinians were killed _ two police officers and a teen-ager _
and 350 were injured, according to Palestinian officials. Six
Israeli soldiers were injured, according to Israeli officials.

   SCI-CO2-EMISSIONS (Undated) _ As the economic and political
difficulty of reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes ever more
obvious, a move is under way to manipulate the carbon cycle so that
it will remove more heat-trapping gases from the air. But the
ambitious idea is surrounded by questions of potential risks and
obstacles. Some researchers are looking for ways to remove carbon
from industrial emissions before they are released. But more
promising, many believe, are prospects for increasing the
absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by what is called the
terrestrial biosphere: the whole complex of living things on land,
mainly plants and various tiny inhabitants of the soil. The
expansion of these carbon reservoirs, or ``sinks,'' in vegetation
and soil has been sanctioned under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. By

believes explains why nine of 10 people in all cultures are
right-handed, why left-handed parents are more likely to have
left-handed children and why identical twins often have different
handedness. Most people, he says, have a specific dominant gene
that makes them right-handed. But about 20 percent of people lack
the right-handed gene, and these people without the gene have a
50-50 possibility of being right-handed or left-handed. By David E.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bill Belichick will make one of the most
significant front office hires of his short Patriots reign when he
names New York Jets scout Lionel Vital the team's national pro
scout this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jets officials confirmed Monday they had decided to grant the
Patriots permission to speak to Vital after denying the request
last week. The change of heart came after Jets director of football
operations Bill Parcells determined that the New England position
would represent a promotion for Vital.
</P>
<P>
   After firing vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier and
national scout Dave Uyrus, and allowing scout Chris Grier _ the son
of Bobby _ to pursue a job with the Miami Dolphins, Belichick has
been hot on the trail of Vital.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Jets official, Vital is expected to finalize a
deal with the Patriots Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vital has worked for Belichick and Patriots executive Scott
Pioli in both Cleveland and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pioli took a similar route to New England, as Parcells, Pioli's
father-in-law, first denied the Patriots permission to talk to him
and then reconsidered, realizing that Pioli was better served by
leaving the Jets organization and joining the Patriots staff
because of his close working ties with Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Vital, an African-American, will be endorsed by
Rainbow Sports, a watchdog organization for diversity in sports. At
the time Grier was fired, he was the highest-ranking black
executive in the NFL. Rainbow Sports director Charles Farrell had
said that while it was Belichick's prerogative to hire and fire as
he pleased, he was watching to see how the Patriots replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   Vital will not replace Grier per se _ Belichick has final
authority over personnel matters _ but he will hold a prominent
position. As national pro scout, Vital will be responsible for
advancing the next opponent, scouting personnel in the NFL, and
recommending free agents for the Patriots to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Vital, 37, is a native of Loreauville, La., who spent time as a
running back and kick returner for the Washington Redskins, who
drafted him in the seventh round in 1985, and Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has not been shy about raiding the Jets for front
office and coaching personnel. He has brought over offensive
coordinator Charlie Weis, secondary coach Eric Mangini, director of
pro personnel Pioli, and personal assistant Berj Najarian.

NBC PLANS   TO EXPAND   `TODAY' AND   ADD 7 SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC plans to shake up its fall schedule on both
mornings and evenings. The network announced its new prime-time
schedule Monday and disclosed plans to expand its 48-year-old
``Today'' program from two hours to three.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the fall ``Today,'' which begins at 7 a.m., will
continue until 10 a.m., the first time a network morning program
has regularly gone past 9.
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans to add seven prime-time shows, a move that
restructures its vaunted Thursday night and excises a long list of
disappointing performers at various points this season, including
the comedies ``Jesse,'' ``Veronica's Closet,'' ``Stark Raving Mad''
and ``Suddenly Susan,'' which all failed despite prime positions
around NBC hit shows on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The network will move one of its Thursday stalwarts,
``Frasier,'' to Tuesday, and shift two newer comedies, ``Will and
Grace'' and ``Just Shoot Me,'' in an effort to refashion the night
into television's strongest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' has always been the strongest morning program, and in
recent years the biggest moneymaker in television. Expanding the
program ends the spinoff ``Later Today,'' which did not perform
well and is being reduced to a syndicated program to be shown at 10
a.m. on television stations owned by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' cast members will continue on the expanded
edition, which will also be under the executive producer Jeff
Zucker. Zucker said that in the last six years increases in local
and network commercials had reduced the program's daily content by
about 10 minutes, leaving him wishing every day that he had more
air time.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said that the network
had been looking for something new for ``Today'' since the program
moved to its ground-floor glassed-in studio at Rockefeller Center
in 1994. The extra hour may pressure NBC's morning competitors to
expand, though none of them have network programming time from 9 to
10 a.m. as NBC does.
</P>
<P>
   NBC added four comedies and three dramas to its prime-time
schedule for the fall. The most prominent Show,'' which brings back
the actor who played Kramer on ``Seinfeld,'' this time as a
bumbling detective. NBC said it would redo much of the show's
pilot, however, because only Richards stood out among the cast
members.
</P>
<P>
   Another former NBC star, Steven Weber of the sitcom ``Wings,''
will return in a show featuring his name. He will play a
businessman whose life takes a wacky turn when a bad blind date
puts a hex on him.
</P>
<P>
   The former Fox star David Alan Grier also will lead a new
comedy, ``D.A.G.,'' in which he plays a Secret Service agent
demoted from covering the president to guarding the first lady,
played by Delta Burke.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth comedy is ``Tucker,'' about a teen-ager and his
mother who are forced to live with a harpylike aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The dramas are headed by ``Deadline,'' the latest from the
executive producer Dick Wolf of ``Law and Order'' fame. This one
stars Oliver Platt as an investigative reporter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' brings the producer Aaron Spelling back to splashy
serial drama with a tale about a rich Beverly Hills family. The
cast include Victoria Principal of ``Dallas'' and Yasmine Bleeth of
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The last drama is a quirky tale of small town life called
``Ed,'' created by Rob Burnett, the longtime writer and producer of
David Letterman's late-night shows. It is about a lawyer who loses
his job and wife and moves back to his hometown, Stuckeyville. It
stars Tom Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is dropping two nights of its five-night-a-week
newsmagazine, ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the full NBC prime-time schedule:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: ``Daddio,'' ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' ``Deadline,''
``Third Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: ``The Michael Richards Show,'' ``Tucker,'' ``Frasier,''
``D.A.G.,''``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: ``Titans,'' ``The West Wing,'' ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: ``Friends,'' ``The Steven Weber Show,'' ``Will and
Grace,'' ``Just Shoot Me,'' ``ER''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: ``Providence,'' ``Dateline,'' ``Law and Order: SVU.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: Movies.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: ``Dateline,'' ``Ed,'' movies.

WORCESTER FIREFIGHTERS FUND CASH TIED UP IN IRS RED TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a December warehouse blaze claimed the lives of six
Worcester firefighters, tens of thousands of donors, touched by the
sacrifices of the men who died, wrote checks to a fund set up by
the hometown newspaper to benefit the firefighters' families.
</P>
<P>
   But the 17 growing children, the five widows, and the aging
parents the men left behind have yet to see a penny of the $6.4
million earmarked for them. And tax rules may dictate that the
families can never receive all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund grew far beyond any expectations of what it might
be,'' said Thomas Cole, a Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette spokesman.
``I have to acknowledge that there's a possibility that the
families will not receive all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's charitable foundation is still filling seats on
a board that will distribute the funds, which they hope to begin
doing by September. The money is gathering interest in a bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Internal Revenue Service regulations essentially prohibit a
non-profit organization from making individuals wealthy. Because
there is so much money, some of it may have to be used for other
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's millions of dollars and only six families, the IRS
is going to look at the amounts going to individuals,'' said Sally
Kaplan Levy, an attorney with the Boston office of McDermott, Will
&AMP; Emery. ``A rule of thumb suggests that if a family was paying for
a $300,000 house on a firefighter's salary, you can help them stay
in that home. But you can't help them move into a $1 million
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fund, set up by the Worcester firefighters' credit
union, received nearly 20,000 contributions and has already
distributed more than $2 million to the families. A Salvation Army
fund collected $171,000, which will soon be given to the families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of the city of Worcester have been great to the
families,'' said Frank Raffa, president of the local firefighter's
union. ``Our fund went off without a hitch. We divided it six equal
ways, which is what the families wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different about the largest fund, set up by the Telegram
&AMP; Gazette, is that it has non-profit status that makes the 43,000
contribution it has received tax-deductible. According to Levy, the
IRS does not intend non-profit status for organizations that
benefit only a small group of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of a tax exemption is that is has to benefit the
community in general,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Telegram &AMP; Gazette's funds could be used for a
memorial or for the families of other Worcester firefighters who
die in the line of duty in the future, said Cole, as long as the
six families' short and long-term needs have been met.
</P>
<P>
   Cole defended the decision to open a fund for the families under
a non-profit umbrella, saying that many businesses would have been
unwilling or unable to make donations or contribute matching gifts
without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax deduction is a large factor in how much money was
raised. But it comes with certain responsibilities, and those are
difficult to meet,'' Cole said. ``We believe that we did the right
thing, and we would do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is meeting with lawyers, accountants and IRS
officials to figure out how to comply with the law, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette is owned by the New York Times
Co., the parent company of the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Other funds have encountered similar difficulties. The
Denver-based Mile High United Way distributed $4.6 million after
the Columbine High School shootings. United Way spokeswoman Kelly
Cahill said that, after weighing the needs of victims and the
intentions of donors, $3 million went to victims and the remainder
went to community programs and services.

&HT;     VIJAY'S NEWEST PUTTER IS DANDY FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vijay Singh admits to being one of those guys
who just loves changing putters. He has, he figures, ``1,000
putters at home, and that's not an understatement.'' So maybe it
wasn't all that significant that he won the Masters last month with
something strange and new called the Dandy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it was significant to the small Los
Angeles-based company founded by Allan Strand. Just as Payne
Stewart put the See-More putter on the map last year with his U.S.
Open victory, Singh's green jacket has put Strand and Dandy into a
little bit of green of their own, with a tenfold increase in orders
over the last month that have resulted in an eight-week backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Tatum, the former USGA president whose golf score commonly
beats his age these days, has become friendly with Strand, and it
was easy to see why during a recent round at Lincoln Park. Tatum,
who says, ``My putting had gotten so poor that I had tried just
about everything,'' sank putt after putt on Lincoln's bumpy greens,
and wouldn't take any of the credit himself.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the ball rattled into the hole, Tatum would look up
and say, ``The Dandy.'' The rest of his foursome was ready to run
to the pro shop at the turn and turn in their putters for one of
these magic wands.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we golfers prefer to think it's the waver and not the
wand who is performing the magic. But Strand has incorporated some
unique elements into his putter that are in keeping with his
primary trade, concert pianist. He studied the masters, and decided
that Horton Smith was the best putter ever, and designed an
instrument that would facilitate the duplication of Smith's form.
</P>
<P>
   The primary element is perfect balance, which promotes
relaxation at address. The putter has an unconventional looking
forward pressing shaft and a face set at zero degrees, but most
noticeable when you hold it is the pistol grip, rotated 90 degrees
to create the one-piece connection between hand, wrist, forearm and
shoulder. It's almost impossible to have a breakdown in form using
this putter.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't still misread the break or blame a
spike mark for your miss. But you can find more information at the
entertaining Web site, www.dandygolf.com, or call 800-DANDY-19. The
company is so confident about its product that it is offering a
free 90-day trial of the Dandy IV, the model Singh used at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   But be patient if you order. Life has gotten a little hectic at
Dandy.

&HT;     RICE'S AGENT PLANS HUDDLE WITH 49ERS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice's agent will meet with general
manager Bill Walsh in Santa Clara on Wednesday in what could be a
significant development toward keeping the wide receiver on the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Or not, according to Jim Steiner, the agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really has developed yet,'' Steiner said. ``We've
received an offer from them which we're going to respond to next
week. We'll visit with Bill and discuss the situation in greater
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have made one- and two-year contract offers to
Steiner, both of which are designed to reduce Rice's salary cap
number for the 2000 season. At present he's due to count $5.49
million against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has said he wants to resolve his status with the 49ers by
next week, a time frame too optimistic for Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy task,'' Steiner said. ``Therefore, I think it
will take some detailed conversations. I don't have any
expectations to (reach an agreement) necessarily, but it doesn't
mean it won't happen. It will probably require more discussions
than next week, but not in a negative sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At last month's minicamp, an upbeat Rice said he was nearly all
the way back from his two 1997 knee surgeries and anticipated
returning to the 49ers this season. He led the club in receiving
last year with 67 catches for 830 yards and five touchdowns, well
below his usual standards but still better than anyone else on the
team.

&HT;     MOM KNOWS BEST, EVEN ABOUT TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mother always knows best, and that goes
especially with new 4-wheel-drive trucks and camping trips with
pals.
</P>
<P>
   This story started more than a year ago, when a friend of mine
named Darrell bought an expensive 4-wheel-drive pick-up truck. It
ended last week in what has become known as ``The Robby Saga,''
with a chain of events on a camp-out that provide a testimonial to
anyone that you best always listen to mama _ or disaster can
strike.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Darrell's new truck was gorgeous, powerful and
expensive, a deep emerald-green, chrome wheels, V8 and loaded
interior. But the family warning signs went on red alert by the way
his son, Robby, 22, was looking at it, like a quivering Doberman
staring up at a cat on a low tree limb, practically drooling and
teeth chattering.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell's wife, Nancy, spotted the look, and knew that trouble
was ahead. She was right, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Robby, who owned a 30-year-old 4-wheeler that wouldn't run, had
been getting around by driving a clunker of an old mini truck. But
hey, he could afford it. Then his imagination started to fly, the
idea of a new truck eating at him, and when a woman friend got in
financial trouble, he jumped at the chance at buying her mini
pick-up truck, nearly new, even though he was pretty much broke
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mama, who didn't think this was a good idea to start with, also
didn't think this was a good idea to end with. ``Since it isn't a
4-wheel-drive, don't be asking to borrow Darrell's truck to go
camping with your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   This too started eating at Robby. Meanwhile, Darrell's truck was
still looking good. On a trip to Point Reyes last month, that truck
was still like a jewel, waxed and polished, so shiny it had a
mirror-like reflection. Robby started thinking about it, about how
the camping and adventure season was just starting, about how his
little mini truck just wouldn't do the job. But it would be perfect
if he could just have a full-size 4-wheel-drive to go camping with
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, he couldn't afford one. He knew his parents would object.
He knew that his mother, who knows best, would have a fit. But the
idea was being fed by a dream, of getting a truck just like
Darrell's, and two weeks ago, Robby found himself on automatic
pilot, driving to a car dealership with stars in his eyes. Before
he knew what was happening, he had signed the papers, had traded in
the mini pick-up, and was driving home in his brand new, full-size,
4-wheel drive pick-up, loaded, extended cab, custom painted a deep
metallic blue with silver panel, and would practically need to rob
banks to make the monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   So one recent weekend, it was time to go camping with his
friends, of course. Watch out, said mom.
</P>
<P>
   Robby headed up to the Sierra Nevada with his pals, where they
knew a perfect little campsite along a stream, right next to a deep
hole, good for fishing. By the looks on his pal's faces, Robby had
the affirmation that his new truck was eye-popping beautiful, yet
powerful and tough, and would unlock adventures across the West. On
the way up to the mountains, they talked about how perfect the
truck was, and maybe taking a trip to Colorado later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   But then a funny thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   At that campsite, as Robby was explaining the virtues of owning
a brand new 4-wheel drive to his rapt audience, the truck started
to roll backwards, that is ``all by itself.'' Apparently it had
been left in neutral, and Robby jumped and ran toward the truck,
but gravity wins, you know, and there was nothing he could do as
4,500 pounds of metal kept rolling backwards down the hill, heading
toward the river.
</P>
<P>
   As the truck picked up speed, it pounded and crashed over
boulders, bushes and small trees. Over and over, the body was
dented and creased, the frame bunged in, the drive shaft, oil pan
and differentials hammered. Robby stood and watched. There were no
other sounds in the forest. The truck just kept pounding downhill,
right into the stream, right into a pool more than 4 feet deep. By
the time the truck came to a stop, water was flooding the interior
all the way up to the dashboard. The engine was completely
submerged.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, shouted his friends, we'll just tow it out!
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, they were able to chain it up with another
4-wheel-drive, and slowly pulled that new truck out of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the next morning, Robby woke up at camp and saw his truck,
all banged up, and decided it was time to go home. But hey, the
engine was brand new, so why not see if it will start?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in his conscience, his mother's voice was shouting,
``No! No! No!''
</P>
<P>
   But he turned the key anyway. In an instant, because water was
in the engine, it threw a rod, that is, the connecting rod between
a piston and crankshaft, or in other words, the engine blew up.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally returned home, getting towed all the way back,
the brand new pick-up truck was totaled, all just one day after his
first camping trip. One of the most expensive new 4-wheel-drives
out there was completely trashed, body, engine and interior
components.
</P>
<P>
   When the incident had to be explained, it reportedly started
with, ``Something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is a true story. The last names have not been included
to protect the guilty. Robby is now driving around in an junky
rental car, an old, beat-up Chevy Malibu, but it's cheap and it
runs.

HUMBLED KNIGHT GETS TO KEEP HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conversation with Bob Knight went on for an hour. Then two.
And then three. Through it all, Indiana University president Myles
Brand saw something in his basketball coach that he had not seen
previously: contrition and _ most importantly to Brand, who held
the fate of Knight in his hands _ sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   And that, perhaps as much as anything, is why Knight is still
the coach of the Hoosiers this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, who met with Knight Saturday, announced the decision
Monday at a press conference in Indianapolis while also saying that
Knight was reprimanded, suspended, fined, and warned that the
behavior that prompted an extraordinary seven-week internal
investigation would no longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But Knight was not fired, contrary to widespread speculation in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Brand outlined the following action taken by the university
against Knight, the basketball coach there for 29 seasons:
</P>
<P>
   --He is suspended for the first three games of the 2000-01
season.
</P>
<P>
   --He is to be fined $30,000, which will be taken out of his base
salary of $163,000.
</P>
<P>
   --He must apologize to several members of the athletic
department, whom he verbally or physically abused during the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
   --There will be a zero-tolerance policy for any further behavior
that is deemed inappropriate by a yet-to-be-selected panel.
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to follow the guidelines will result in dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This behavior cannot and will not be tolerated at Indiana
University,'' said Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's meeting, said Brand, his inclination was
to dismiss the coach for a series of vulgar acts and displays of
temper that were becoming more and more embarrassing to the
university. But when he heard the contrition in Knight's voice and
sensed a change in attitude, he decided to give Knight one last
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have seen him so contrite and apologetic,'' said
Brand. ``He made a pledge to me he would change his ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was triggered two months ago when former IU
player Neil Reed alleged that Knight had choked him during a
practice three years ago. A videotape subsequently surfaced that
backed up Reed, showing Knight grabbing the player by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a firestorm of other stories and accusations,
which led to the internal investigation by the school's Board of
Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lengthy pattern of troubling behavior by
Coach Knight,'' said Board of Trustee chairman John Walda, who said
29 people were interviewed during the probe. ``The trustees are
concerned about the reputation of this school. We will not tolerate
conduct from any persons who work for us that we consider to be
embarrassing or that does not live up to the high standards that we
expect from all who represent our university.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no scared cows at Indiana University, and that
certainly includes the basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who was not present at the press conference _ he
reportedly is on vacation in Scotland _ issued a statement that
said, ``I have absolutely no problem with the guidelines. I
recognize I have a problem with my temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Brand and Walda conceded that such warnings have not been
effective in controlling Knight, whom many perceive as being above
any code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who reportedly will submit to therapy to control his
anger, has developed a distinctive style of coaching over the past
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it has produced 753 victories and three
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   It also has produced a series of incidents that range from
sarcasm with the media to verbal and physical abuse of those who
work for him and around him, including athletic director Clarence
Doninger.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IU officials, the action they are taking is
severe, the toughest policy the of any college in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said that each incident individually was not considered a
cause for termination, but as a whole they revealed a disturbing
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves a last chance,'' said Brand. ``And I think
he has a chance of pulling it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Knight, who is so used to running his program his way,
live within guidelines that could define every display of temper,
every sarcastic remark as a violation of the code of conduct?
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgments will be necessary,'' Brand conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a commitment to change his behavior. Will he be able
to do it? Let's give him a chance.''

   PHOENIX {ndash} (EDITORS {ndash} SHORT SIDEBAR AT END OF THIS
ARTICLE) When I told my television station's news director a few
months ago that I intended to end nearly 30 years in print and
broadcast journalism, I borrowed a line from a former British
minister's resignation letter. I said I wanted to spend more time
with my principles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think he understood. How could anyone walk away from a
job that many people would kill to have?
</P>
<P>
   Pay and benefits were certainly not an issue. And I thoroughly
enjoyed and admired the people I worked with. The public
recognition was nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, journalism's values (or, more
accurately, what journalism values) had diverged from mine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone. A new study by the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press found that four in 10 journalists, both print and
broadcast, now admit to working in an environment that increasingly
asks them to avoid ``newsworthy'' stories to benefit the financial
interests of their ``news'' organizations. These journalists
believe market pressures are pushing them toward the salacious and
sensational and away from the complicated and important.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the four in 10 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I began feeling I was doing a disservice to the TV audience by
telling them only what was happening rather than why. I felt it was
unfair to compress complex subjects into a few breathless seconds
or inches. I was embarrassed when my stories were so often
oversold, or just wrong, in ``promos'' and ``teases.'' I was
frustrated that news is defined as being whatever is urgent rather
than what is ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking news'' becomes the most important news, even if
there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   I cringed that every story had to be ``shocking'' or some kind
of superlative, even if it wasn't: ``a parent's worst nightmare,''
``a story you must see,'' ``an exclusive interview'' (with someone
who is constantly being interviewed).
</P>
<P>
   I once suggested to a news manager that we program the Alt-H
keys on the computer keyboard to automatically insert hype into
every story.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, is increasingly in the business of
marketing itself, not the news. The primary criterion is that a
story be promotable. In fact, story promos usually get more air
time than the stories themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out a competent, useful news product isn't the goal. The
only goal is to have the largest viewer- or readership.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, criticisms I'd dismissed for years - ``You're only doing
this to sell more newspapers or get higher ratings'' - are now
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was heartened one morning a while back to hear a
group of news managers discuss doing a story about the local
fallout of the Asian economic crisis. The electronics industry, in
particular, could be affected, leading to lost jobs and distressed
families. It was an important local story.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion fell silent when one producer asked, ``How do
we avoid the glaze factor?'' Those are the code words for ``It's
boring.'' Everyone looked at each other and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how about the double murder?'' someone else offered.
They were off and running.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known that news is a business. You have to have
readers and viewers to be able to attract advertisers who pay the
bills, including your salary. But we tried to separate ourselves by
saying that if we do good journalism, readers and viewers and
therefore advertisers will come.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true. Now, journalists are forced to pander to
the same gawker reflex that causes traffic to snarl near car
wrecks. We want viewers and readers to slow down to see us, so we
give them a whole bunch of car wrecks and other forms of mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stories are ``tested'' with random phone calls asking
people if they'd prefer a story about ``Deadly Germs on Your
Child's Playground Equipment'' to ``Welfare Policies and the
Poor.'' Public policy always loses in that kind of analysis.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just television. Newspapers, radio and Web-based news
services are suffering from many of the same pressures cited in the
Pew Center study.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have pared their staffs or shifted them away from
fulfilling a socially critical but apparently financially
unprofitable role of public watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, there were full-time reporters from at
least three different news organizations covering the Maricopa
County courts, Phoenix City Hall and the city's police department.
Today, only two of those beats have full-time print reporters. In
their place is a cadre of government-paid information officers.
News organizations simply publish or air what they're told by the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressures increase, journalists, both individually and
organizationally, have little time to think, let alone be
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Get on the air or in print. Move on to the next story.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that all news shows become the Bloomberg
Report or be like demolition derby. Somewhere, there's a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Do the crime/accident story, but don't bludgeon it with ``team
coverage'' and reaction sound bites from people who always say they
are shocked it happened in their quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Give the headlines so that viewers and readers have a sense of
what's happening in their community, but devote time to the
important topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Important'' is more difficult. It's hard to take pictures of
it; it's harder to understand and then explain it. And it's hardest
of all to make it compelling. But that's what professional
journalists are supposed to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen unless media companies commit to it. Not
abdicate it.

   Special for The Arizona Republic
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, the firm that measures television
viewership, has the power to change American politics. It could do
it by moving the November ratings period to October.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   There are four months in the year (February, May, July and
November) when the numbers of television viewers are counted, both
electronically and on paper journals. The results determine how
much stations can charge for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, news managers do what they can to attract the most viewers
during those so-called ``sweeps'' months. That's when you hear
television stories promoted on the radio; that's when billboards
spring up featuring perfectly manicured anchors, and that's when
some stations give away money.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for sweeps starts several months ahead of time.
Production of sweeps pieces is done during the month before they
air.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for democracy, elections are the first Tuesday in
November. There are three more weeks of sweeps after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are so busy during October handling ``daily''
mayhem and preparing stories for sweeps pieces for November that
they don't have time to do election stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the ratings period was October (ending, say, on the
first Tuesday in November), television stations would have a strong
incentive to work diligently during September to prepare
thoughtful, insightful, analytical, comprehensive profiles of
candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   And they could put up billboards bragging that their anchors are
the only ones in town who have actually heard of the candidates.

By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON _ Most of Catalina Island's tourist lodgings are
clustered near Avalon's town center, which patrons might find to be
both a convenience and a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk from the boat dock to the small hotels that hug
Crescent Avenue, but your room is likely to be right on top of the
perpetual, late-night bash that is Avalon's pedestrian plaza.
</P>
<P>
   An establishment slightly inland can provide different
drawbacks. On a recent visit, I sampled the Hotel St. Lauren, a
big, pink, Victorian wedding cake of a hotel at the corner of
Metropole Avenue and Beacon Street. It was comfortable enough, but
Catalina, in favoring electric golf carts over internal-combustion
vehicles, has swapped one form of pollution for another.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean-view room on the second floor here was like having a
box at the Golf Cart 500. The carts continually scream up and down
the hills, all day and late into the night, their overtaxed motors
sounding like electric shavers during a power surge.
</P>
<P>
   For peace and quiet on Catalina _ without having to pay the
steep rates of the incomparable Inn on Mount Ada _ the best option
might be the Zane Grey Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   It perches on a hill above the island's Casino, at the west edge
of Avalon Bay. And Chimes Tower Road, which snakes past its front
door, gets only infrequent traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo's greatest attributes are its location _ the views
are terrific _ and its distinction as the former home of Grey, a
prolific writer of Western novels in the 1910s, '20s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   At that, this place might not be for everyone. It's rustic, with
simple, basic furnishings. It feels old, it smells old ... it is
old _ built at the author's bidding in 1926. Because it was later
converted from home to hotel, most of the guest rooms had to be
retrofitted with bathrooms, and in many cases it was a tight
squeeze. A 5-foot-11 patron is likely to find, for example, a
shower stall that is exactly 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have neither phones nor TVs. Instead, guests who want
to catch a particular show gather by the fireplace in the living
room _ and hope no one has chosen that particular moment to play
the Pueblo's grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat visitors to the Pueblo roll with these quirks, and
perhaps like the place all the more for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's an old building, there are some things we can't
change,'' said general manager Michael Shehabi. ``But everything is
functional, everything works. Sometimes people hear 'rustic' and
they're not sure what they're going to get. We make sure it's super
clean, but the rusticness stays _ we're not going to modernize it
at all. A lot of the guests tell me they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo has 16 guest rooms, seven of which have full ocean
views. Four of the nine canyon-view rooms have private balconies.
It also has something that's hard to come by in Catalina: a pool.
In deference to Grey's legacy, this one is in the shape of an
arrowhead.
</P>
<P>
   Three different sitting areas at the Pueblo provide excellent
views _ two of the bay, one of the scrub-covered hills to the west.
Those views come with a price, in that it's a steep climb from the
town center to here. It can be invigorating on a cool evening, but
if you're not up to it, complimentary taxi service is provided at
scheduled times during the day. (The taxi ride from the boat dock
to the hotel is also complimentary.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the Pueblo's nice touches is that each of the rooms is
named after one of Grey's novels. He produced more than 60 of them,
cranking them out at the rate of about one per month, and wrote
many of them at his home in Altadena or here. Most of the yarns are
moral tales featuring a loner protagonist with a mysterious past
who fights to uphold virtue and protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you stay in a room named for his most popular works
_ ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' (1912) or ``The Vanishing
American'' (1925) _ but you'll find a complete set of them in a
bookshelf in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can find the book that corresponds to your room. Then,
on a still Catalina night, in a room high above the hum of Avalon,
you can settle in with one of these books, and be transported into
Grey's world by words like these: ``There, beside his horse, stood
Lassiter, his dark apparel and the great black gun-sheaths
contrasting singularly with his gentle smile ...'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates at the Zane Grey Pueblo range from $135 to $165 in high
season (June through September). Until June 1, rates range from $80
to $110 on midweek nights, $135 to $165 on weekends. For
information or reservations, call (800) 378-3256 or (310) 510-0966.
The Pueblo's Web site is difficult to find and fairly unsatisfying
when you finally get there (it doesn't show pictures of individual
rooms, for example, as most lodging Web sites do). Go to
www.virtualcities.com, then click on ``Bed &AMP; Breakfast'' under
First Traveler's Choice. Then click on ``California,'' and scroll
down to ``Islands Off the Coast'' to find the Zane Grey Pueblo
entry. &QL;

waiting pages and pages for a payoff, which pretty much never

   The Kim Basinger onslaught continues, this time as the cover

so-called ``panic attacks,'' which kept her paralyzed and homebound
for long periods. It also recalls Basinger's bankruptcy, brought on
by a suit filed after she backed out of a verbal agreement to star
in the macabre film ``Boxing Helena.'' Another interesting article
lets the readers choose the Top 10 onscreen couples, which is
headed by Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad, closely followed by Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The list is more remarkable for its

four (in July, tentatively titled ``Harry Potter and the Doomspell

both readers and non-readers alike, catapulting her to the top of
the bestseller lists, and to No.1 in our hearts. Or at least, most
of our hearts. There is also a sidebar warning that you shouldn't

Cambodian prime minister is trying to establish a special tribunal

   PHOENIX {ndash} (EDITORS {ndash} SHORT SIDEBAR AT END OF THIS
ARTICLE) When I told my television station's news director a few
months ago that I intended to end nearly 30 years in print and
broadcast journalism, I borrowed a line from a former British
minister's resignation letter. I said I wanted to spend more time
with my principles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think he understood. How could anyone walk away from a
job that many people would kill to have?
</P>
<P>
   Pay and benefits were certainly not an issue. And I thoroughly
enjoyed and admired the people I worked with. The public
recognition was nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, journalism's values (or, more
accurately, what journalism values) had diverged from mine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone. A new study by the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press found that four in 10 journalists, both print and
broadcast, now admit to working in an environment that increasingly
asks them to avoid ``newsworthy'' stories to benefit the financial
interests of their ``news'' organizations. These journalists
believe market pressures are pushing them toward the salacious and
sensational and away from the complicated and important.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the four in 10 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I began feeling I was doing a disservice to the TV audience by
telling them only what was happening rather than why. I felt it was
unfair to compress complex subjects into a few breathless seconds
or inches. I was embarrassed when my stories were so often
oversold, or just wrong, in ``promos'' and ``teases.'' I was
frustrated that news is defined as being whatever is urgent rather
than what is ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking news'' becomes the most important news, even if
there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   I cringed that every story had to be ``shocking'' or some kind
of superlative, even if it wasn't: ``a parent's worst nightmare,''
``a story you must see,'' ``an exclusive interview'' (with someone
who is constantly being interviewed).
</P>
<P>
   I once suggested to a news manager that we program the Alt-H
keys on the computer keyboard to automatically insert hype into
every story.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, is increasingly in the business of
marketing itself, not the news. The primary criterion is that a
story be promotable. In fact, story promos usually get more air
time than the stories themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out a competent, useful news product isn't the goal. The
only goal is to have the largest viewer- or readership.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, criticisms I'd dismissed for years - ``You're only doing
this to sell more newspapers or get higher ratings'' - are now
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was heartened one morning a while back to hear a
group of news managers discuss doing a story about the local
fallout of the Asian economic crisis. The electronics industry, in
particular, could be affected, leading to lost jobs and distressed
families. It was an important local story.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion fell silent when one producer asked, ``How do
we avoid the glaze factor?'' Those are the code words for ``It's
boring.'' Everyone looked at each other and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how about the double murder?'' someone else offered.
They were off and running.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known that news is a business. You have to have
readers and viewers to be able to attract advertisers who pay the
bills, including your salary. But we tried to separate ourselves by
saying that if we do good journalism, readers and viewers and
therefore advertisers will come.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true. Now, journalists are forced to pander to
the same gawker reflex that causes traffic to snarl near car
wrecks. We want viewers and readers to slow down to see us, so we
give them a whole bunch of car wrecks and other forms of mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stories are ``tested'' with random phone calls asking
people if they'd prefer a story about ``Deadly Germs on Your
Child's Playground Equipment'' to ``Welfare Policies and the
Poor.'' Public policy always loses in that kind of analysis.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just television. Newspapers, radio and Web-based news
services are suffering from many of the same pressures cited in the
Pew Center study.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have pared their staffs or shifted them away from
fulfilling a socially critical but apparently financially
unprofitable role of public watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, there were full-time reporters from at
least three different news organizations covering the Maricopa
County courts, Phoenix City Hall and the city's police department.
Today, only two of those beats have full-time print reporters. In
their place is a cadre of government-paid information officers.
News organizations simply publish or air what they're told by the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressures increase, journalists, both individually and
organizationally, have little time to think, let alone be
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Get on the air or in print. Move on to the next story.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that all news shows become the Bloomberg
Report or be like demolition derby. Somewhere, there's a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Do the crime/accident story, but don't bludgeon it with ``team
coverage'' and reaction sound bites from people who always say they
are shocked it happened in their quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Give the headlines so that viewers and readers have a sense of
what's happening in their community, but devote time to the
important topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Important'' is more difficult. It's hard to take pictures of
it; it's harder to understand and then explain it. And it's hardest
of all to make it compelling. But that's what professional
journalists are supposed to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen unless media companies commit to it. Not
abdicate it.

<P>
   Special for The Arizona Republic
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, the firm that measures television
viewership, has the power to change American politics. It could do
it by moving the November ratings period to October.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   There are four months in the year (February, May, July and
November) when the numbers of television viewers are counted, both
electronically and on paper journals. The results determine how
much stations can charge for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, news managers do what they can to attract the most viewers
during those so-called ``sweeps'' months. That's when you hear
television stories promoted on the radio; that's when billboards
spring up featuring perfectly manicured anchors, and that's when
some stations give away money.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for sweeps starts several months ahead of time.
Production of sweeps pieces is done during the month before they
air.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for democracy, elections are the first Tuesday in
November. There are three more weeks of sweeps after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are so busy during October handling ``daily''
mayhem and preparing stories for sweeps pieces for November that
they don't have time to do election stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the ratings period was October (ending, say, on the
first Tuesday in November), television stations would have a strong
incentive to work diligently during September to prepare
thoughtful, insightful, analytical, comprehensive profiles of
candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   And they could put up billboards bragging that their anchors are
the only ones in town who have actually heard of the candidates.

writing, he is less committed to school and less likely to go to
college.'' However, he is more likely to become a NASCAR driver. So
there. Story notes that two national images of gender emerged in
the last year: for girls, the sight of the U.S. women's soccer team
winning the World Cup; for boys, the grainy film from the Columbine
massacre. Also includes a terribly dull recounting of all the
digging into Abraham Lincoln's personal life. The story has you
waiting pages and pages for a payoff, which pretty much never
comes. However, the author does establish that Lincoln was our 16th
president. There is also a fascinating look into the Skull and
Bones, the Yale secret society that counted Texas Gov. George W.
Bush (and his dad) as members.

   ``BIOGRAPHY''
</P>
<P>
   The Kim Basinger onslaught continues, this time as the cover
girl of ``Biography,'' which has a decent piece about Basinger's
struggles to rise from a junior beauty queen from Athens, Ga., to a
major Hollywood star. Basinger succeeded in spite of suffering from
so-called ``panic attacks,'' which kept her paralyzed and homebound
for long periods. It also recalls Basinger's bankruptcy, brought on
by a suit filed after she backed out of a verbal agreement to star
in the macabre film ``Boxing Helena.'' Another interesting article
lets the readers choose the Top 10 onscreen couples, which is
headed by Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad, closely followed by Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The list is more remarkable for its
omissions. No Bogie and Bacall, nor Tracy and Hepburn, but Goldie
Hawn and Kurt Russell? I think even THEY(beginitalic)
(enditalic)got up and left in the middle of
``Overboard(beginitalic).''
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``BOOK''
</P>
<P>
   Better grab this one up before it flies off the racks. After
all, it mentions the words Harry and Potter in the same sentence,
serving up an interesting piece on author J.K. Rowling, who struck
gold with the Harry Potter stories and is about to publish number
four (in July, tentatively titled ``Harry Potter and the Doomspell
Tournament''). Article notes that Rowling's success has attracted
both readers and non-readers alike, catapulting her to the top of
the bestseller lists, and to No.1 in our hearts. Or at least, most
of our hearts. There is also a sidebar warning that you shouldn't
read it if you don't want to know what happens to Harry. Strangely
enough, we don't. There is also a piece on Judith Krantz, who
churns out beach books like ``Princess Daisy''and
``Lovers(beginitalic).(enditalic)'' Interestingly, Krantz was 50
years old in 1978 when she hit it big with
``Scruples(beginitalic).(enditalic)'' A sample of Krantz's advice:
``A woman should get plastic surgery the minute she can see herself
starting to look like her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW REPUBLIC''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off the big win in Vermont, the magazine tells us that
``domestic partnership'' laws are not enough and that gay couples
should be able to get hitched like everybody else. ``Separate but
equal was a failed and pernicious policy with regard to race,'' the
author states, ``it will be a failed and pernicious policy with
regard to sexual orientation.'' Article also argues that marriage
is one of the most civil rights granted to Americans. Another story
notes that little has been done to punish the Khmer Rouge butchers
who perpetrated genocide between 1975 and 1979, but the current
Cambodian prime minister is trying to establish a special tribunal
to try some of the worst offenders. Meanwhile, former Khmer leaders
shop and tend their gardens. The weekly TRB column struggles to
evaluate the presidential timber of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, with comparisons to former presidents from
Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton. The result? A real sinking
feeling that we're in deeeep trouble.

   (EDITORS {ndash} INFORMATION FOR A ``BOX'' OR SHORT SIDEBAR IS
AT THE END OF THIS STORY) A generation of women born into
affluence, liberated by the pill and empowered by the fight against
gender bias will not go quietly into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer women, born 1946-64, are reaching the edge of
retirement but, to say the least, are un-retiring in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be nasty. We aren't going to be submissive
about this,'' said Sue Reynolds-Scanlon, 55, describing how women
of her generation now face age discrimination in the workplace and
skimpy services for health care and elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds-Scanlon is a researcher at the University of South
Florida who studies aging. She speaks for the first wave of the 40
million-strong pre-retirement Baby Boomer women who find themselves
responsible for the care of parents and worried about the prospects
for their own health care. They are becoming radicalized to push
for government programs that will help them as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to political candidates: a growing number of midlife
women not only want Medicare and Social Security programs to be
preserved, they want them expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take this budget surplus, and this
extraordinary excess of revenue in our society and decide how to
provide better care for elders,'' Bogre said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Washington is changing quickly, according to Larry
Polivka, elder issues expert and director of the Florida Policy
Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trimming Medicare, it's likely that Congress will
expand the program to include a prescription drug benefit. Last
year, a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers passed,'' Polivka said.
``This year, there is talk about pushing it up to $3,000. The next
step may be paying family caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that some of these changes can be chalked
up to election-year promises, the tide has changed in favor of
larger government as assistance in elder care and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, as more Baby Boomers and their parents age, you are
going to see more demand for Social Security and Medicare
programs,'' Polivka said. ``The window is closing for trimming back
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have forecast that Medicare would add anything this
year?'' he said, pointing to the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Baby Boomers starting to have their own health
problems, two-thirds of women between 40 and 50 expect to be
responsible for an elderly relative or parents in the next 10
years, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although married Baby Boomers are expected to be better off than
their parents in retirement, that is not the case with single
women. The number of midlife women who are divorced, never married
or childless is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they may need to rely more on public programs, says
Reynolds-Scanlon, who is specializing in Baby Boomers in her
research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Boomer women work outside the home, on average
they make only 74cents for every dollar a man makes. Their personal
pension plans are slim or non-existent because their jobs may have
been spotty, temporary, or simply low-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the
commune, at least in some form.
</P>
<P>
   Many women Boomers, not wanting to go to an elder care facility
like their parents, are talking with friends and relatives about
living together. Drake already lives with her twin sister and
brother-in-law, and they are talking with other family members
about forming a family compound for their old age.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Daniels of Washington, D.C., deputy director of the Social
Security disability program, plans to live with her sister and
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The politics is thrilling, too; a return to the energies and
values of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bell, 54, of Sedona, is thrilled that her activist
spirit, dormant for a long time, is being activated again. She cut
her political teeth years ago fighting racism and sexism. Then the
needs of her work took over her life. Her present involvement grew
out of her experience as a caregiver for her mother, who has
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bell plans to be among the women who will be fighting for
changes in public policy. ``Being out here (on the front lines)
again feels good,'' she says. ``It has been much too long.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, it's expected that Boomers will be talking about death
as much as they did in the 1960s about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Brigit Wilson, 47, a geriatric nurse from Omaha, Neb., and some
of her friends are already discussing end-of-life rituals or
parties they want to have some day. Boomers to the end, they refuse
to die without ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see on TV the hot new funeral fads, you will know we
are there,'' Reynolds-Scanlon said.
</P>

   INFORMATION BOX BELOW ----
</P>
<P>
   Facts about Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   --It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born
than were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year
for births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During
the peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four
children in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

   PHOENIX {ndash} (EDITORS {ndash} SHORT SIDEBAR AT END OF THIS
ARTICLE) When I told my television station's news director a few
months ago that I intended to end nearly 30 years in print and
broadcast journalism, I borrowed a line from a former British
minister's resignation letter. I said I wanted to spend more time
with my principles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think he understood. How could anyone walk away from a
job that many people would kill to have?
</P>
<P>
   Pay and benefits were certainly not an issue. And I thoroughly
enjoyed and admired the people I worked with. The public
recognition was nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, journalism's values (or, more
accurately, what journalism values) had diverged from mine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone. A new study by the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press found that four in 10 journalists, both print and
broadcast, now admit to working in an environment that increasingly
asks them to avoid ``newsworthy'' stories to benefit the financial
interests of their ``news'' organizations. These journalists
believe market pressures are pushing them toward the salacious and
sensational and away from the complicated and important.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the four in 10 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I began feeling I was doing a disservice to the TV audience by
telling them only what was happening rather than why. I felt it was
unfair to compress complex subjects into a few breathless seconds
or inches. I was embarrassed when my stories were so often
oversold, or just wrong, in ``promos'' and ``teases.'' I was
frustrated that news is defined as being whatever is urgent rather
than what is ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking news'' becomes the most important news, even if
there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   I cringed that every story had to be ``shocking'' or some kind
of superlative, even if it wasn't: ``a parent's worst nightmare,''
``a story you must see,'' ``an exclusive interview'' (with someone
who is constantly being interviewed).
</P>
<P>
   I once suggested to a news manager that we program the Alt-H
keys on the computer keyboard to automatically insert hype into
every story.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, is increasingly in the business of
marketing itself, not the news. The primary criterion is that a
story be promotable. In fact, story promos usually get more air
time than the stories themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out a competent, useful news product isn't the goal. The
only goal is to have the largest viewer- or readership.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, criticisms I'd dismissed for years - ``You're only doing
this to sell more newspapers or get higher ratings'' - are now
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was heartened one morning a while back to hear a
group of news managers discuss doing a story about the local
fallout of the Asian economic crisis. The electronics industry, in
particular, could be affected, leading to lost jobs and distressed
families. It was an important local story.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion fell silent when one producer asked, ``How do
we avoid the glaze factor?'' Those are the code words for ``It's
boring.'' Everyone looked at each other and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how about the double murder?'' someone else offered.
They were off and running.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known that news is a business. You have to have
readers and viewers to be able to attract advertisers who pay the
bills, including your salary. But we tried to separate ourselves by
saying that if we do good journalism, readers and viewers and
therefore advertisers will come.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true. Now, journalists are forced to pander to
the same gawker reflex that causes traffic to snarl near car
wrecks. We want viewers and readers to slow down to see us, so we
give them a whole bunch of car wrecks and other forms of mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stories are ``tested'' with random phone calls asking
people if they'd prefer a story about ``Deadly Germs on Your
Child's Playground Equipment'' to ``Welfare Policies and the
Poor.'' Public policy always loses in that kind of analysis.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just television. Newspapers, radio and Web-based news
services are suffering from many of the same pressures cited in the
Pew Center study.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have pared their staffs or shifted them away from
fulfilling a socially critical but apparently financially
unprofitable role of public watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, there were full-time reporters from at
least three different news organizations covering the Maricopa
County courts, Phoenix City Hall and the city's police department.
Today, only two of those beats have full-time print reporters. In
their place is a cadre of government-paid information officers.
News organizations simply publish or air what they're told by the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressures increase, journalists, both individually and
organizationally, have little time to think, let alone be
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Get on the air or in print. Move on to the next story.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that all news shows become the Bloomberg
Report or be like demolition derby. Somewhere, there's a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Do the crime/accident story, but don't bludgeon it with ``team
coverage'' and reaction sound bites from people who always say they
are shocked it happened in their quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Give the headlines so that viewers and readers have a sense of
what's happening in their community, but devote time to the
important topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Important'' is more difficult. It's hard to take pictures of
it; it's harder to understand and then explain it. And it's hardest
of all to make it compelling. But that's what professional
journalists are supposed to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen unless media companies commit to it. Not
abdicate it.

   By Rich Robertson

<P>
   Special for The Arizona Republic
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, the firm that measures television
viewership, has the power to change American politics. It could do
it by moving the November ratings period to October.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   There are four months in the year (February, May, July and
November) when the numbers of television viewers are counted, both
electronically and on paper journals. The results determine how
much stations can charge for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, news managers do what they can to attract the most viewers
during those so-called ``sweeps'' months. That's when you hear
television stories promoted on the radio; that's when billboards
spring up featuring perfectly manicured anchors, and that's when
some stations give away money.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for sweeps starts several months ahead of time.
Production of sweeps pieces is done during the month before they
air.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for democracy, elections are the first Tuesday in
November. There are three more weeks of sweeps after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are so busy during October handling ``daily''
mayhem and preparing stories for sweeps pieces for November that
they don't have time to do election stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the ratings period was October (ending, say, on the
first Tuesday in November), television stations would have a strong
incentive to work diligently during September to prepare
thoughtful, insightful, analytical, comprehensive profiles of
candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   And they could put up billboards bragging that their anchors are
the only ones in town who have actually heard of the candidates.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's friends were generous with him
last year, but his foes continued to cost him money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted $23,602 worth of gifts in 1999, many of them
related to his favorite pasttime _ playing golf. He also accepted
$2.25 million to defray exhorbitant legal fees stemming from the
Monica S. Lewinsky episode, according to his annual financial
disclosure form released Monday by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But with less than one year left in office, the president is
still in tremendous debt. Clinton reported carrying between $2.35
million and $10.75 million in liabilities, all of it in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four law firms listed _ Williams &AMP; Connolly, and
Skader, Arps, Slater, Meagher &AMP; Flom _ are each owed between $2
million and $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The form requires only a range of figures rather than exact
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton reported assets of $1.2 million to $5.57
million for 1998, the biggest chunk coming from a blind trust in
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's name. Those figures were
roughly the same as they were for 1997, but higher than the range
of $760,000 to $1.7 million reported for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The president has between $1,001 and $15,000 in a local checking
account, this latest statement showed. Other non-earned income
assets include stock in AT&AMP;T, State Street Corp., Lucent Technology
and Bell Atlantic, worth between $33,005 and $145,000. But unlike
those Americans who have become wealthy investing in the ``new
economy'' Clinton lauds, the president garnered between just $402
and $2,600 in dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The president also holds between $1.15 million and $1.35 million
in three blind trusts _ healthy amounts, but still not enough to
pay off his legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Among gifts the president accepted are a set of J.P. Tod bags,
given by Diego Della Valle of Milan, Italy, and valued at $2,750; a
$500 saxophone given by Pedro Ruiz of San Sebastian De Los Reyes,
Spain, and a man's suit, valued at $2,500 and given by Arnold H.
Simon of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several fans of the president played to Clinton's widely known
affection for golf, contributing a total of $2,902 worth of golf
clubs and golf paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential presents given last year were a burgundy sofa
($1,088), crystal ($1,215), a cashmere sweater set and tie ($900),
a Mont Blanc pen ($450), an antique Edison phonograph and two
musical cylinders ($650), a wooden Hano Mana doll ($1,000), a
framed Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph ($500), and a cashmere throw
($1,350).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also accepted pottery ($1,550), a CD collection ($297),
silk ties and two handkerchiefs ($890), cuff links and a book
($1,515), a 1956 ``High Noon'' playbill ($700), a Harley Davidson
leather jacket ($320), a silver Tzedakah box ($650), a coat ($800),
a bronze relief of President Abraham Lincoln, a book on President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and an antique book, ``Transatlantic
Sketches,'' which was listed as being worth $1,075.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Vice President Al Gore was unburdened by either
Clinton's legal debts or the breadth of generosity that came the
president's way.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his $175,400-a-year salary, Gore reported a house in
Arlington, Va., and a home, farm and property in Carthage, Tenn.,
worth between $650,004 and $1,350,000. The farm is leased, drawing
$2,420 in gross income.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took in $20,000 in royalties from a mineral lease, and
$16,457 in royalties in his book, ``Earth in the Balance.'' Mrs.
Tipper Gore is listed as a shareholder in Aitchenson Real Estate
Inc., of Arlington, Va. Her asserts from that interest are between
$100,001 and $250,000, Gore's financial disclosure statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Other assets include between $32,004 and $131,000 in local bank
accounts, as well as between $500,001 and $1 million in Occidental
Petroleum stock. The stock is listed as being part of the estate of
Gore's late father, Albert Gore Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's children also have their own assets: Albert Gore III has
between $50,002 and $115,000 in the bank. Sarah Gore has between
$3,003 and $45,000 in bank accounts, and Kristin Gore is listed as
owning between $1,001 and $15,000 in cash accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The only present the vice president listed was $1,550 in legal
time donated by longtime friend James Neal of Nashville, Tenn. The
Gores' only liabilities are home loans and personal credit,
totaling $250,003 and $600,000. Gore does not list any
campaign-related liabilities.

   PHOENIX {ndash} (EDITORS {ndash} SHORT SIDEBAR AT END OF THIS
ARTICLE) When I told my television station's news director a few
months ago that I intended to end nearly 30 years in print and
broadcast journalism, I borrowed a line from a former British
minister's resignation letter. I said I wanted to spend more time
with my principles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think he understood. How could anyone walk away from a
job that many people would kill to have?
</P>
<P>
   Pay and benefits were certainly not an issue. And I thoroughly
enjoyed and admired the people I worked with. The public
recognition was nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the line, journalism's values (or, more
accurately, what journalism values) had diverged from mine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone. A new study by the Pew Research Center for People
and the Press found that four in 10 journalists, both print and
broadcast, now admit to working in an environment that increasingly
asks them to avoid ``newsworthy'' stories to benefit the financial
interests of their ``news'' organizations. These journalists
believe market pressures are pushing them toward the salacious and
sensational and away from the complicated and important.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the four in 10 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I began feeling I was doing a disservice to the TV audience by
telling them only what was happening rather than why. I felt it was
unfair to compress complex subjects into a few breathless seconds
or inches. I was embarrassed when my stories were so often
oversold, or just wrong, in ``promos'' and ``teases.'' I was
frustrated that news is defined as being whatever is urgent rather
than what is ``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking news'' becomes the most important news, even if
there's no news to report.
</P>
<P>
   I cringed that every story had to be ``shocking'' or some kind
of superlative, even if it wasn't: ``a parent's worst nightmare,''
``a story you must see,'' ``an exclusive interview'' (with someone
who is constantly being interviewed).
</P>
<P>
   I once suggested to a news manager that we program the Alt-H
keys on the computer keyboard to automatically insert hype into
every story.
</P>
<P>
   Television, in particular, is increasingly in the business of
marketing itself, not the news. The primary criterion is that a
story be promotable. In fact, story promos usually get more air
time than the stories themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out a competent, useful news product isn't the goal. The
only goal is to have the largest viewer- or readership.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, criticisms I'd dismissed for years - ``You're only doing
this to sell more newspapers or get higher ratings'' - are now
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I was heartened one morning a while back to hear a
group of news managers discuss doing a story about the local
fallout of the Asian economic crisis. The electronics industry, in
particular, could be affected, leading to lost jobs and distressed
families. It was an important local story.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion fell silent when one producer asked, ``How do
we avoid the glaze factor?'' Those are the code words for ``It's
boring.'' Everyone looked at each other and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how about the double murder?'' someone else offered.
They were off and running.
</P>
<P>
   I've always known that news is a business. You have to have
readers and viewers to be able to attract advertisers who pay the
bills, including your salary. But we tried to separate ourselves by
saying that if we do good journalism, readers and viewers and
therefore advertisers will come.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true. Now, journalists are forced to pander to
the same gawker reflex that causes traffic to snarl near car
wrecks. We want viewers and readers to slow down to see us, so we
give them a whole bunch of car wrecks and other forms of mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stories are ``tested'' with random phone calls asking
people if they'd prefer a story about ``Deadly Germs on Your
Child's Playground Equipment'' to ``Welfare Policies and the
Poor.'' Public policy always loses in that kind of analysis.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just television. Newspapers, radio and Web-based news
services are suffering from many of the same pressures cited in the
Pew Center study.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have pared their staffs or shifted them away from
fulfilling a socially critical but apparently financially
unprofitable role of public watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, there were full-time reporters from at
least three different news organizations covering the Maricopa
County courts, Phoenix City Hall and the city's police department.
Today, only two of those beats have full-time print reporters. In
their place is a cadre of government-paid information officers.
News organizations simply publish or air what they're told by the
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressures increase, journalists, both individually and
organizationally, have little time to think, let alone be
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Get on the air or in print. Move on to the next story.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that all news shows become the Bloomberg
Report or be like demolition derby. Somewhere, there's a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Do the crime/accident story, but don't bludgeon it with ``team
coverage'' and reaction sound bites from people who always say they
are shocked it happened in their quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Give the headlines so that viewers and readers have a sense of
what's happening in their community, but devote time to the
important topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Important'' is more difficult. It's hard to take pictures of
it; it's harder to understand and then explain it. And it's hardest
of all to make it compelling. But that's what professional
journalists are supposed to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen unless media companies commit to it. Not
abdicate it.

   By Rich Robertson
</P>
<P>
   Special for The Arizona Republic
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, the firm that measures television
viewership, has the power to change American politics. It could do
it by moving the November ratings period to October.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   There are four months in the year (February, May, July and
November) when the numbers of television viewers are counted, both
electronically and on paper journals. The results determine how
much stations can charge for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So, news managers do what they can to attract the most viewers
during those so-called ``sweeps'' months. That's when you hear
television stories promoted on the radio; that's when billboards
spring up featuring perfectly manicured anchors, and that's when
some stations give away money.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for sweeps starts several months ahead of time.
Production of sweeps pieces is done during the month before they
air.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for democracy, elections are the first Tuesday in
November. There are three more weeks of sweeps after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are so busy during October handling ``daily''
mayhem and preparing stories for sweeps pieces for November that
they don't have time to do election stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the ratings period was October (ending, say, on the
first Tuesday in November), television stations would have a strong
incentive to work diligently during September to prepare
thoughtful, insightful, analytical, comprehensive profiles of
candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   And they could put up billboards bragging that their anchors are
the only ones in town who have actually heard of the candidates.

   (EDITORS {ndash} INFORMATION FOR A ``BOX'' OR SHORT SIDEBAR IS
AT THE END OF THIS STORY) A generation of women born into
affluence, liberated by the pill and empowered by the fight against
gender bias will not go quietly into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer women, born 1946-64, are reaching the edge of
retirement but, to say the least, are un-retiring in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be nasty. We aren't going to be submissive
about this,'' said Sue Reynolds-Scanlon, 55, describing how women
of her generation now face age discrimination in the workplace and
skimpy services for health care and elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds-Scanlon is a researcher at the University of South
Florida who studies aging. She speaks for the first wave of the 40
million-strong pre-retirement Baby Boomer women who find themselves
responsible for the care of parents and worried about the prospects
for their own health care. They are becoming radicalized to push
for government programs that will help them as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to political candidates: a growing number of midlife
women not only want Medicare and Social Security programs to be
preserved, they want them expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take this budget surplus, and this
extraordinary excess of revenue in our society and decide how to
provide better care for elders,'' Bogre said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Washington is changing quickly, according to Larry
Polivka, elder issues expert and director of the Florida Policy
Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trimming Medicare, it's likely that Congress will
expand the program to include a prescription drug benefit. Last
year, a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers passed,'' Polivka said.
``This year, there is talk about pushing it up to $3,000. The next
step may be paying family caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that some of these changes can be chalked
up to election-year promises, the tide has changed in favor of
larger government as assistance in elder care and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, as more Baby Boomers and their parents age, you are
going to see more demand for Social Security and Medicare
programs,'' Polivka said. ``The window is closing for trimming back
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have forecast that Medicare would add anything this
year?'' he said, pointing to the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Baby Boomers starting to have their own health
problems, two-thirds of women between 40 and 50 expect to be
responsible for an elderly relative or parents in the next 10
years, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although married Baby Boomers are expected to be better off than
their parents in retirement, that is not the case with single
women. The number of midlife women who are divorced, never married
or childless is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they may need to rely more on public programs, says
Reynolds-Scanlon, who is specializing in Baby Boomers in her
research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Boomer women work outside the home, on average
they make only 74cents for every dollar a man makes. Their personal
pension plans are slim or non-existent because their jobs may have
been spotty, temporary, or simply low-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the
commune, at least in some form.
</P>
<P>
   Many women Boomers, not wanting to go to an elder care facility
like their parents, are talking with friends and relatives about
living together. Drake already lives with her twin sister and
brother-in-law, and they are talking with other family members
about forming a family compound for their old age.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Daniels of Washington, D.C., deputy director of the Social
Security disability program, plans to live with her sister and
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The politics is thrilling, too; a return to the energies and
values of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bell, 54, of Sedona, is thrilled that her activist
spirit, dormant for a long time, is being activated again. She cut
her political teeth years ago fighting racism and sexism. Then the
needs of her work took over her life. Her present involvement grew
out of her experience as a caregiver for her mother, who has
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bell plans to be among the women who will be fighting for
changes in public policy. ``Being out here (on the front lines)
again feels good,'' she says. ``It has been much too long.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, it's expected that Boomers will be talking about death
as much as they did in the 1960s about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Brigit Wilson, 47, a geriatric nurse from Omaha, Neb., and some
of her friends are already discussing end-of-life rituals or
parties they want to have some day. Boomers to the end, they refuse
to die without ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see on TV the hot new funeral fads, you will know we
are there,'' Reynolds-Scanlon said.

<P>
   Facts about Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   --It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born
than were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year
for births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During
the peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four
children in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to political candidates: a growing number of midlife
women not only want Medicare and Social Security programs to be
preserved, they want them expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take this budget surplus, and this
extraordinary excess of revenue in our society and decide how to
provide better care for elders,'' Bogre said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Washington is changing quickly, according to Larry
Polivka, elder issues expert and director of the Florida Policy
Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trimming Medicare, it's likely that Congress will
expand the program to include a prescription drug benefit. Last
year, a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers passed,'' Polivka said.
``This year, there is talk about pushing it up to $3,000. The next
step may be paying family caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that some of these changes can be chalked
up to election-year promises, the tide has changed in favor of
larger government as assistance in elder care and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, as more Baby Boomers and their parents age, you are
going to see more demand for Social Security and Medicare
programs,'' Polivka said. ``The window is closing for trimming back
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have forecast that Medicare would add anything this
year?'' he said, pointing to the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Baby Boomers starting to have their own health
problems, two-thirds of women between 40 and 50 expect to be
responsible for an elderly relative or parents in the next 10
years, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although married Baby Boomers are expected to be better off than
their parents in retirement, that is not the case with single
women. The number of midlife women who are divorced, never married
or childless is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they may need to rely more on public programs, says
Reynolds-Scanlon, who is specializing in Baby Boomers in her
research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Boomer women work outside the home, on average
they make only 74cents for every dollar a man makes. Their personal
pension plans are slim or non-existent because their jobs may have
been spotty, temporary, or simply low-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the
commune, at least in some form.
</P>
<P>
   Many women Boomers, not wanting to go to an elder care facility
like their parents, are talking with friends and relatives about
living together. Drake already lives with her twin sister and
brother-in-law, and they are talking with other family members
about forming a family compound for their old age.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Daniels of Washington, D.C., deputy director of the Social
Security disability program, plans to live with her sister and
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The politics is thrilling, too; a return to the energies and
values of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bell, 54, of Sedona, is thrilled that her activist
spirit, dormant for a long time, is being activated again. She cut
her political teeth years ago fighting racism and sexism. Then the
needs of her work took over her life. Her present involvement grew
out of her experience as a caregiver for her mother, who has
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bell plans to be among the women who will be fighting for
changes in public policy. ``Being out here (on the front lines)
again feels good,'' she says. ``It has been much too long.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, it's expected that Boomers will be talking about death
as much as they did in the 1960s about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Brigit Wilson, 47, a geriatric nurse from Omaha, Neb., and some
of her friends are already discussing end-of-life rituals or
parties they want to have some day. Boomers to the end, they refuse
to die without ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see on TV the hot new funeral fads, you will know we
are there,'' Reynolds-Scanlon said.

   BOOMER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   --It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born
than were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year
for births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During
the peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four
children in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

IT'S ALL IN THE PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen is talking about how he had contemplated becoming a
criminal before he turned to comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm being facetious when I say I had toyed with
the fact of a life of crime... At first I had thought about going
into law enforcement but (in those days) there were height
requirements. So then I turned to the idea of being a crook where
there were no height requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The riff sounds a lot like something from the stand-up comedian
Allen of the '60s. But instead of a coffeehouse, the Oscar-winning
director was in town last week to offer some lessons and warnings
about the filmmaking business to an audience of students and others
at UCLA's Wadsworth Theatre. He also screened his new film, aptly
titled ``Small Time Crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is the tale of an ex-con dishwasher (Ray Winkler,
played by Allen) in New York City who has a scheme to rob a bank
and get enough money so he and his manicurist wife, Frenchy,
(Tracey Ulman) can move to Florida in luxury. The plot is
reminiscent of Allen's first directorial achievement, the 1969 film
``Take the Money and Run,'' where he played an inept compulsive
criminal named Virgil Starkwell.
</P>
<P>
   When it's suggested that Ray is Virgil aged gracefully, Allen
responds, ``I have aged gracefully. I look good (audience laughs).
!ital!I do.!'' he insists, sounding again like one of his
characters. ``I'll be 65 in December. My father will be 100 this
year. We have youthful genes. I have no face work whatsoever. I
have good energy.'' Then he gets down to business, talking about
filmmaking. ``Take the Money and Run'' was made my a young person
and operates by gag by gag by gag, and fortunately there were
enough gags to keep the film afloat. ``Small Time Crooks'' is a
film that operates on character, and the characters are suppose to
be funny so you don't have to go on a frenetic surrealistic pace
all the time.'' Adding that ``it's a film by a more competant
gracefully aged filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is Allen's 31st film (he makes about one a
year) and is being distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. The film is
lighter fare than Allen has turned out in recent years, most of
which have drawn critical praise but little at the box office. Best
known for ``Annie Hall,'' which took four Oscars, including Best
Picture, Allen has had few real hits since. His 1986 ``Hannah and
Her Sisters'' being a notable exception. He picked up a
screenwriting Oscar for that one, and Dianne Weist and Michael
Caine won best supporting acting awards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ``Celebrity'' with a post ``Titanic'' Leonardo DiCaprio
took in only $5 million, and last year's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' made
$4.5 million despite Oscar nominations for stars Sean Penn and
Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't seem to bother Allen, whose films are low
budget and eventually make a profit when the overseas box office
and video are factored in. He admits that some people see his films
as being the same (``Oh, another Woody Allen movie''). For him,
they're all different _ murder mysteries, musicals, comedies,
dramas _ but other ``feel there's a sameness to them, the way one
could say there are 500 different Chinese dishes, but it's all
Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allen making movies is about ``trying to make art head on.''
And awards don't mean anything. Though being a 22-time Oscar
nominee and four-time winner he's never attended the Academy
Awards.(``I don't believe in competition among !ital!alleged works
of art.'') Ultimately, he says, he wants to please himself. His
first screenplay was the 1965 film ``What's New Pussycat,'' the
Hollywood process soured him and he vowed never to go that route
again.
</P>
<P>
   But making a film, he tells the audience of perspective
filmmakers in a question and answer session, is no picnic for him.
(``I'm in trouble almost all the time on films.'')
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the writing. He says that inspiration can come
from anywhere, and if he has no inspiration he'll sit in a room and
think for hours. ``I use to write for television and that's the way
you had to do it because the show had to go on and eventually
something comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly warns that you can get a million ideas that sound
good but 50 pages down the line you're stuck. ``It's very important
for me to see where the thing goes before I write it; otherwise you
end up with a charming idea that just runs out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's suggested that shooting the film would be more fun.
Allen looks slightly aghast. ``Making a film. That's not fun,
either. Making it, you're out there at six in the morning, and it's
freezing and everyone is saying hurry up, hurry up it's costing us
money, and the actor or actress is late to the set, and jokes
aren't working and the sun is in the wrong position and the
cameraman is having a tantrum. This'' he stresses, ``is not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what about the post-production process?
</P>
<P>
   ``Editing is fun until you get your first cut ... then it's like
taking a cold shower,'' he says. ``You look at your first cut, and
you realize how god awful your work is really going to be and
there's no way out of it....''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes on to describe what must be the dream and reality
of many a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I start a film ... I'm thinking that this film will be so
much greater than the `Bicycle Thief,' so much greater than `Grand
Illusion' that the world will finally realize what an intense, deep
genius I am. Then when I see that first cut of the film, I'm
thinking, `God, just let me survive.' I'll do anything. I'll take
the end of the film and put it at the front.... I'll dub voices.
I'll do anything so I won't suffer a catastrophic embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the gamble,'' he warns the aspiring filmmakers in
the audience.``It's very rare that you have a pleasurable
experience. Just so you know. In case you want to change your
major.''
</P>
<P>
   As for working with actors, Allen finds that a more pleasuable
experience, and despite the low budgets on his film, the Hollywood
elite are happy to take part. Besides, DiCaprio, Penn and Caine,
Julia Roberts Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Tracey Ullman and Kenneth
Branagh have all appeared in Allen films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pay a very low amount, shockingly low. Everybody
that works, whether it's Julia Roberts or Sean Penn or whoever it
is gets the same $5,000 a week. Whether they get $10 million on
another picture, they get $50,000 for our picture, and that's our
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says he gives the script to the actors and get their
input. ``I tell them they can make changes as long as they make the
scene happen believably.... If they screw up I correct them, but
more often than not I'm working with first-rate actors and they do
a great job, better than I could do, and in the end I get the
credit for it.'' Dressed in a sweater and slacks, Allen appeared
very much like he does in his films, which raised another question
that vexes the filmmaker: That his onscreen persona is him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't me though,'' Allen insists. ``I've been knocking at
doors for 30 years telling people that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says that the confusion over his onscreen characters and
offscreen life stem from the fact that he looks the same. Unlike
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx who had
onscreen characters different from their offscreen lives, ``I wear
the same clothes off screen as I do on screen. And I looked like
the same character in my real life as I do on screen. But I'm not
the same character.
</P>
<P>
   ``In really life I'm very competant, I'm very disciplined, hard
working and resonably calm. In movies I'm frenetic, I'm
hyper-neurotic and involved in extreme situations that never happen
to me in my real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Allen's life has been the subject of tabloids. His
scandalous relationship in 1992 with Soon-Yi Previn, his then 18
years old adopted daughter and the subsequent combative breakup
with actress Mia Farrow made him a villian in some people's eyes.
But today, the controversy has lost its sting, and no one in the
audience brought it up. A couple of women even thanked his for
making films that showed women in a real way, citing his 1988 film
``Another Woman''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Marx, Allen remembered having lunch with him years
ago and thinking ``that this guy was like a Jewish uncle in my
family. No different.... And I thought if I acheive the greatness
I'd like to... that's what really what it is in the end. You lose
your teeth; you make those wisecracks to waitresses... you can see
where I'm going with this.'' But morbidity aside, Allen doesn't
show signs of slowing down. More films are in the works. Last year,
he and adopted a baby daughter, 14-month old Bechet, and recently
moved into an Upper East Side townhouse in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And he's achieved his original goal (``I just wanted something
that would keep me interested my whole life''), even if it wasn't
as a card cheat or a safe cracker.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling that despite why Allen isn't a
small-time crook, he sees himself as one in the world of art, never
quite measuring up to the Ingmar Bergmans and Francois Truffauts,
giants of filmmaking (``real heavy stuff.''), that he so admires.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what keeps Allen going, always hoping the next film
will be a masterpiece. But there is one thing he's given us that
Bergman hasn't, a lot of laughs, and if the resounding applause
from the audience at UCLA is any indication, that counts big time.

   (EDITORS {ndash} INFORMATION FOR A ``BOX'' OR SHORT SIDEBAR IS
AT THE END OF THIS STORY) A generation of women born into
affluence, liberated by the pill and empowered by the fight against
gender bias will not go quietly into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer women, born 1946-64, are reaching the edge of
retirement but, to say the least, are un-retiring in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be nasty. We aren't going to be submissive
about this,'' said Sue Reynolds-Scanlon, 55, describing how women
of her generation now face age discrimination in the workplace and
skimpy services for health care and elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds-Scanlon is a researcher at the University of South
Florida who studies aging. She speaks for the first wave of the 40
million-strong pre-retirement Baby Boomer women who find themselves
responsible for the care of parents and worried about the prospects
for their own health care. They are becoming radicalized to push
for government programs that will help them as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to political candidates: a growing number of midlife
women not only want Medicare and Social Security programs to be
preserved, they want them expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take this budget surplus, and this
extraordinary excess of revenue in our society and decide how to
provide better care for elders,'' Bogre said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Washington is changing quickly, according to Larry
Polivka, elder issues expert and director of the Florida Policy
Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trimming Medicare, it's likely that Congress will
expand the program to include a prescription drug benefit. Last
year, a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers passed,'' Polivka said.
``This year, there is talk about pushing it up to $3,000. The next
step may be paying family caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that some of these changes can be chalked
up to election-year promises, the tide has changed in favor of
larger government as assistance in elder care and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, as more Baby Boomers and their parents age, you are
going to see more demand for Social Security and Medicare
programs,'' Polivka said. ``The window is closing for trimming back
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have forecast that Medicare would add anything this
year?'' he said, pointing to the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Baby Boomers starting to have their own health
problems, two-thirds of women between 40 and 50 expect to be
responsible for an elderly relative or parents in the next 10
years, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although married Baby Boomers are expected to be better off than
their parents in retirement, that is not the case with single
women. The number of midlife women who are divorced, never married
or childless is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they may need to rely more on public programs, says
Reynolds-Scanlon, who is specializing in Baby Boomers in her
research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Boomer women work outside the home, on average
they make only 74cents for every dollar a man makes. Their personal
pension plans are slim or non-existent because their jobs may have
been spotty, temporary, or simply low-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the
commune, at least in some form.
</P>
<P>
   Many women Boomers, not wanting to go to an elder care facility
like their parents, are talking with friends and relatives about
living together. Drake already lives with her twin sister and
brother-in-law, and they are talking with other family members
about forming a family compound for their old age.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Daniels of Washington, D.C., deputy director of the Social
Security disability program, plans to live with her sister and
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The politics is thrilling, too; a return to the energies and
values of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bell, 54, of Sedona, is thrilled that her activist
spirit, dormant for a long time, is being activated again. She cut
her political teeth years ago fighting racism and sexism. Then the
needs of her work took over her life. Her present involvement grew
out of her experience as a caregiver for her mother, who has
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bell plans to be among the women who will be fighting for
changes in public policy. ``Being out here (on the front lines)
again feels good,'' she says. ``It has been much too long.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, it's expected that Boomers will be talking about death
as much as they did in the 1960s about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Brigit Wilson, 47, a geriatric nurse from Omaha, Neb., and some
of her friends are already discussing end-of-life rituals or
parties they want to have some day. Boomers to the end, they refuse
to die without ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see on TV the hot new funeral fads, you will know we
are there,'' Reynolds-Scanlon said.

   BOOMER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   --It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born
than were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year
for births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During
the peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four
children in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

   (EDITORS {ndash} INFORMATION FOR A ``BOX'' OR SHORT SIDEBAR IS
AT THE END OF THIS STORY) A generation of women born into
affluence, liberated by the pill and empowered by the fight against
gender bias will not go quietly into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer women, born 1946-64, are reaching the edge of
retirement but, to say the least, are un-retiring in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be nasty. We aren't going to be submissive
about this,'' said Sue Reynolds-Scanlon, 55, describing how women
of her generation now face age discrimination in the workplace and
skimpy services for health care and elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds-Scanlon is a researcher at the University of South
Florida who studies aging. She speaks for the first wave of the 40
million-strong pre-retirement Baby Boomer women who find themselves
responsible for the care of parents and worried about the prospects
for their own health care. They are becoming radicalized to push
for government programs that will help them as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.

   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.

   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the

   Many women Boomers, not wanting to go to an elder care facility
like their parents, are talking with friends and relatives about
living together. Drake already lives with her twin sister and
brother-in-law, and they are talking with other family members
about forming a family compound for their old age.

   Sherry Bell, 54, of Sedona, is thrilled that her activist
spirit, dormant for a long time, is being activated again. She cut
her political teeth years ago fighting racism and sexism. Then the
needs of her work took over her life. Her present involvement grew
out of her experience as a caregiver for her mother, who has
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bell plans to be among the women who will be fighting for
changes in public policy. ``Being out here (on the front lines)
again feels good,'' she says. ``It has been much too long.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, it's expected that Boomers will be talking about death
as much as they did in the 1960s about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Brigit Wilson, 47, a geriatric nurse from Omaha, Neb., and some
of her friends are already discussing end-of-life rituals or
parties they want to have some day. Boomers to the end, they refuse
to die without ceremony.

   BOOMER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   --It's the Baby Boom because 20 million extra kids were born
than were expected over a 19-year period, 1946-64. The peak year
for births was 1957, when 4.3 million children were born. During
the peak years of the Baby Boom, the typical family had four
children in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby Boomers' motto is ``question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   -- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although married Boomers will have greater assets, pensions and
income than their parents had in retirement, there are more
unmarried and childless women at midlife than their parents'
generation. They could need more social services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' family trees are looking more like beanpoles than
pyramids. Aging Baby Boomers have record-low numbers of children
and record-high numbers of living brothers and sisters. They have
more step and half kin due to higher rates of divorce and
remarriage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 million Baby Boomers, there are generational
differences. The leading edge Baby Boomers, those born 1946-1955,
are the social activists. The rear group, 1956-1964, are the
Yuppies.

   (EDITORS {ndash} INFORMATION FOR A ``BOX'' OR SHORT SIDEBAR IS
AT THE END OF THIS STORY) A generation of women born into
affluence, liberated by the pill and empowered by the fight against
gender bias will not go quietly into old age.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer women, born 1946-64, are reaching the edge of
retirement but, to say the least, are un-retiring in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be nasty. We aren't going to be submissive
about this,'' said Sue Reynolds-Scanlon, 55, describing how women
of her generation now face age discrimination in the workplace and
skimpy services for health care and elder care.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds-Scanlon is a researcher at the University of South
Florida who studies aging. She speaks for the first wave of the 40
million-strong pre-retirement Baby Boomer women who find themselves
responsible for the care of parents and worried about the prospects
for their own health care. They are becoming radicalized to push
for government programs that will help them as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in a working world to network, organize and carefully
Daytimer their agendas, this generation of women is preparing to
body-slam the political establishment at the polls. Recognition of
this emerging voting bloc has in recent months stopped many
politicians from openly advocating ideas like privatizing Social
Security or cutting Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Women account for 80 percent of the 23 million Americans who
care for the elderly. A study by the National Alliance for
Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons found
that nearly one-third of caregivers must significantly curtail
their hard-won careers by taking leaves of absence, reducing job
hours, turning down promotions, retiring early or even quitting in
midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   These personal sacrifices, made for lack of care options, are
fueling the women's political determination.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, women are forming political alliances to
push for better elder care, said Roselyn O'Connell of Phoenix,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Many women are
radicalized by the difficulty they have in getting help for their
aging parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's group, which in the past pushed for federal funds
for child day care, now is focused on increasing federal funds for
``dependent care,'' and other women's groups are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, a group of 30 women in their 40s and 50s recently
formed a health coalition, Healthy Women for a Lifetime, to lobby
health maintenance organizations for preventive treatment for
osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also watching to make sure that Social Security will be
preserved, now that so many of us are closer to needing it,'' said
O'Connell, who is 55. In a recent National Public Radio broadcast,
O'Connell encouraged midlife women to seize political power. It's
hard to marginalize 40 million older women if they vote, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomers' leading edge, those born from 1946 to 1955, is the
most politically active group of the tidal wave generation. Along
with women now 55 to 65, they changed women's status in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bogre, 47, saw her own latent activism kick in after
her mother died in a Phoenix care home. Bogre believes her mother
was the victim of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the state attorney general to investigate the case,
prosecute and convict the home operator. But she didn't like the
way the judicial system handled the case, and she wants to be part
of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, director of photography at the prestigious Parsons School
of Design in New York, is going back to school to study elder law.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre agrees that there is a take-no-prisoners political mood
brewing among women. ``My generation is not going to disappear like
women of my mother's generation did,'' she said. ``And I don't
think I'll be less confrontational at 70 than I am now at 47.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer women learned in their youth how to talk comfortably and
openly about their common problems and how to work in groups to
make changes, says Marilyn Powers, a Valley Phoenix psychologist
and author of a book published last year on midlife,
(beginitalic)Bridge Between Two Lifetimes(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The idea of radical, experimental change appeals to visionaries,
Powers said, and the Boomer generation has plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Powers argues that the Boomer women not only will reshape
politics by ``dropping in,'' but they may reshape corporate life by
``dropping out'' and forming organizations or business partnerships
to serve their needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, women Boomers are highly educated. Half the women of
retirement age in 2020 will have a college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women feel more powerful than earlier generations,'' said
Vicky Drake, 51, a member of the new women's health coalition,
Healthy Women for a Lifetime. ``We have been working women all of
our adult lives. We are better informed and we ask questions and
insist on answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake watched her mother become frail and eventually need
nursing-home care because of osteoporosis. Last year, at 50, Drake
was diagnosed with the bone-weakening disease herself. ``Almost
everyone I know is dealing with something or themselves or their
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is aggressively battling the disease through medication
and an extensive exercise regimen. As a result, she is optimistic
her older years will be better than her mother's. But she wants
other women to have the chance to be healthier, too, which is why
she is active in the Healthy Women group.
</P>
<P>
   Bogre, Drake and other midlife women are talking more openly
about the lack of employer- and government-sponsored support
programs, such as time off for care-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to political candidates: a growing number of midlife
women not only want Medicare and Social Security programs to be
preserved, they want them expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take this budget surplus, and this
extraordinary excess of revenue in our society and decide how to
provide better care for elders,'' Bogre said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Washington is changing quickly, according to Larry
Polivka, elder issues expert and director of the Florida Policy
Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trimming Medicare, it's likely that Congress will
expand the program to include a prescription drug benefit. Last
year, a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers passed,'' Polivka said.
``This year, there is talk about pushing it up to $3,000. The next
step may be paying family caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that some of these changes can be chalked
up to election-year promises, the tide has changed in favor of
larger government as assistance in elder care and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, as more Baby Boomers and their parents age, you are
going to see more demand for Social Security and Medicare
programs,'' Polivka said. ``The window is closing for trimming back
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have forecast that Medicare would add anything this
year?'' he said, pointing to the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Baby Boomers starting to have their own health
problems, two-thirds of women between 40 and 50 expect to be
responsible for an elderly relative or parents in the next 10
years, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although married Baby Boomers are expected to be better off than
their parents in retirement, that is not the case with single
women. The number of midlife women who are divorced, never married
or childless is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they may need to rely more on public programs, says
Reynolds-Scanlon, who is specializing in Baby Boomers in her
research on aging.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Boomer women work outside the home, on average
they make only 74cents for every dollar a man makes. Their personal
pension plans are slim or non-existent because their jobs may have
been spotty, temporary, or simply low-paying.
</P>
<P>
   Many stepped away from work to raise children, which decreases
the amount of Social Security they receive. Less than half of
divorced, separated or widowed Baby Boomers own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The common need for housing and assistance may bring back
another institution from their young days in the 1960s: the
commune, at least in some form.

 PERSONALS: The Swiss Architects and the UT Museum
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news
file.) &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Metropolis story about the diversity of opinion on Herzog &AMP; de
Meuron's plans for the new de Young museum mentioned that in
November, the Swiss firm had quit designing an art museum for the
University of Texas in Austin with ``spectacularly bad blood on
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   This sent Personals scurrying to the Austin American-Statesman,
which described the debacle and included several hilarious local
columns. But proponents of the new de Young can relax: The
villains, at least as reported in Texas papers, were the regents
displeased with the selection committee's choice of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The regents wondered a) Why couldn't they have a good old
American firm design the museum? b) Why did the structure have to
be so modern? Couldn't the museum be designed to fit in with older
buildings on campus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a big problem with flat roofs,'' said one regent when
viewing the original design. ``I have a flat roof on my house. I
wouldn't want a flat roof,'' said another. The architects
redesigned the structure to have a curved roof, but complaints
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Beverly Hillbillies vs. Bauhaus'' was the headline over a
column by the newspaper's  &UR; Michael Barnes &LR; , who called the
architects' resignation ``a victory of the modern Texas version of
the Know Nothing Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The regents' shortsighted opinions have resulted in blackening
the growing reputation of the arts at the University of Texas
throughout the world,'' said art department professor
 &UR; Michael Mogavero &LR;  at a protest rally after the architects resigned.
Architecture Dean  &UR; Larry Speck &LR;  quit a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist  &UR; John Kelso &LR;  suggested that if the regents wanted a
design that looked familiar, ``why don't they build an art museum
that looks like a Dairy Queen?'' As for the regents themselves,
``What do these people know about architecture?'' asked Kelso. One
regent's resume, he noted, states that he is an `` `avid
fisherman.' Great. Just what we need. An art museum that looks like
Roy Bob's Bait &AMP; Tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the regents changed the procedure that had mandated
a selection committee, and gave themselves total power to decide on
architects.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ARTISTS FOR HILLARY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rudolph Giuliani &LR; 's attempt to cut off museum funds over the
``Sensation'' art at the recent Brooklyn show has apparently had
political repercussions among artists.
</P>
<P>
   A May 23 fund-raising auction for the first lady's senatorial
campaign is being supported by the likes of  &UR; Yoko Ono &LR; ,  &UR; Robert &LR; 
 &UR; Rauschenberg &LR; ,  &UR; Christo &LR; ,  &UR; Frank Stella &LR; ,  &UR; Richard Serra &LR; ,  &UR; Julian &LR;

 &UR; Sherman &LR; ,  &UR; Jennifer Bartlett &LR; ,  &UR; Jim Dine &LR; , &UR; Frank Gehry &LR;  and  &UR; Nan &LR; 
 &UR; Goldin &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is an anti-Giuliani factor to this enormous
response from the art community,'' &UR; Chuck Close &LR;  told the New York
Daily News. Giuliani ``is a bit of a dull monkey,'' said &UR; Larry &LR; 
 &UR; Rivers &LR; . ``Rudy's trying to come across as nuts but honest, and I
think generally that's not a bad combination. But now he's
wrestling with subjects that are a little too complex for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ First, some nominations for a new name for the Faked Outrage
Hall of Fame, as proposed herein last week:  &UR; Tamsen Armstrong &LR; 
suggests it be called the Captain Renault Award, after the
 &UR; Claude Rains &LR;  role in ``Casablanca,'' who comes into Rick's casino
and ``is shocked to find that gambling is going on!'' And
 &UR; Tony Enos &LR;  suggests the Doubtraged Community.
</P>
<P>
   Enos' nominee is the drivers who put ``Save the Rainforest''
bumper stickers on their SUVs.  &UR; Bo Pollard &LR;  suggests  &UR; Leslie &LR; 
 &UR; Shorb &LR; , an Oregon high school girl who showered with the boys after
gym, and then hired a lawyer to sue the school district when she
was punished. She was strutting her outrage (and legal case) on

<P>
   ``Who says money can't buy you `Friends?'' joked Scott Sassa,
NBC West Coast President, as the popular long-running comedy was
officially renewed for two seasons on Monday, when the network
announced its up-front presentation of the upcoming fall season.
OK, so it was a short national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Each cast member will receive $750,000 per episode, as well as a
healthy chunk of future profits from syndication. Sources suggested
that had the cast not budged from its $1 million-per-episode
demand, the network was prepared to walk away from negotiations. Of
course, with syndication money, which comes from the production
company and not the network, each star will earn around $40 million
per year rather than a mere pittance of $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also announced the remainder of its new fall schedule in New
York with spectacle high and low, from the cast of ``Will &AMP; Grace''
performing a mini-opera to embattled sock-puppet Triumph the Insult
Comic Dog slagging last year's scheduling of ``Stark Raving Mad''
before ``ER.'' ``That's like saying, `We've got some Alpo Supreme
for you, but first you've got to drink out of this toilet,'''
taunted Triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Friends,'' three other series given
multiple-year deals. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' was guaranteed two more
years. ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``ER,'' the long-running, Emmy-winning
cop and medical shows, respectively, were each renewed for four
more years apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a breakdown of the network's strengths and weaknesses,
and how the new programming should enhance its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Strong points: Despite being No. 2 in the ratings, NBC has
arguably the strongest overall programming schedule, with quality
shows appealing to young and upscale viewers. In addition to strong
Tuesdays and its Must-See Thursday, NBC strengthened Wednesdays and
Fridays last season with new shows like ``The West Wing'' and ``Law
&AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Weak points: NBC's strong evenings proved vulnerable in the past
year, with Tuesday and Thursday fortresses crumbling a smidgen
under ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' siege. Mondays,
Saturdays and Sundays all took a pounding, and, like every other
network except Fox last year, the network struggled in comedy
development. Only ``Daddio,'' a coolly received family comedy,
survived the season. Its best comedy hope of the midseason series,
the poorly titled but hilarious ``M.Y.O.B.,'' is getting burned off
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   New this fall season: On Mondays, ``Law &AMP; Order'' creator Dick
Wolf contributes his third series to the network, ``Deadline,''
starring Oliver Platt as a newspaper columnist and journalism
professor who enlists his students on investigative stories.
Tuesdays see the arrival of three new comedies: ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' in which the former ``Seinfeld'' sidekick plays a
bumbling private investigator; ``Tucker,'' sort of ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' four or five years later; and ``DAG,'' starring David Alan
Grier as a Secret Service Agent forced to protect the First Lady
(Delta Burke). Both ``Richards'' and ``Tucker'' are single camera,
no-laugh-track comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling returns to prime-time soap operas with the new
Wednesday series ``Titans,'' in which one of the subplots features
a father and son battling over Yasmine Bleeth. On Thursdays, the
tentatively titled ``The Steven Weber Show'' stars the former
``Wings'' actor as a man whose life becomes Murphy's Law writ large
when a blind date goes awry and the woman casts a spell on him.
Sunday's new series, ``Ed,'' from ``Late Show with David
Letterman'' head writer Rob Burnett, is a sort of ``Providence''
meets ``Northern Exposure,'' as a lawyer returns from the big city
to his small, eccentric hometown and buys a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling changes: ``Frasier'' got bounced out of its cushy
Must-See Thursday slot at 9 p.m. in order to make room for
up-and-comer ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' with ``Just Shoot Me'' tagging along
for the ride (it'll air at 9:30 p.m. on Thursdays). ``Frasier''
moved to Tuesday, where it will have to anchor a trio of untested
new comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason replacements: Steven Spielberg exec-produces the
Marine drama ``Semper Fi,'' starring Scott Bairstow and Vicellous
Reon Shannon. Tony winner Kristin Chenoweth stars as a wholesome
Midwestern girl working for a crass Big Apple tycoon in
``Kristin.'' ``American Pie's'' co-creator Adam Herz exec-produces
the high school comedy ``Go Fish.'' In the hourlong dramedy ``News
from the Edge,'' a young reporter goes to work for a supermarket
tabloid, only to discover that all its stories about alien love
children and ratboys are true. And three sisters (Vicki Lewis, A.J.
Langer and Katherine LaNasa) find all routes lead to Los Angeles in
the comedy ``These Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Other programming: NBC (along with cable channels CNBC and MSNBC
and their attendant websites) will present a whopping 437 hours of
coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics from Sydney, Australia.
Upcoming mini-series include ``A Man in Full,'' based on Tom
Wolfe's best-selling behemoth, and ``Jackie, Ethel and Joan: The
Women of Camelot,'' based on the book about the women of the
Kennedy dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis: A couple of years ago, when ``3rd Rock from the Sun''
was a huge hit, the network moved it to a different night and
surrounded it with so-so comedies, which spelled the end of its
ratings dominance. We're not saying that will happen with
``Frasier'' on Tuesdays, but they're already reshooting the pilot
for the wan-looking ``The Michael Richards Show.'' And ``DAG''
looks far too broad to be a comfortable companion series with
Kelsey Grammar's urbane comedy of manners. ``Tucker'' may have been
a better fit with the family-oriented ``Daddio'' on Monday nights,
which would've left ``3rd Rock'' (which has been moved around too
much for any series to flourish) on Tuesdays and given NBC more of
an established presence for the evening (the network no doubt
wanted to keep its single-camera comedies in a bloc).
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdays, the ``guilty pleasure'' (NBC's words) ``Titans''
is a curious lead-in indeed for the bracingly intelligent ``The
West Wing.'' The quirky, seriocomic ``Ed'' would seem a better fit
for the equally seriocomic ``West Wing,'' and ``Titans'' just feels
like a big, brash Sunday night show. Overall, though, the lineup
shows a lot of promise _ ``The Steven Weber Show'' looks like a
rarity, a genuinely funny comedy shoehorned in amidst the Must-See
Thursday hits, and ``Ed'' and ``Deadline'' looking particularly
strong, though they're stranded in competitive timeslots.
September's Olympics coverage will be a monumental aide in
promoting the entire new schedule.

  Hotel offers rooms with a view and good books to read 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use with Catalina package) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON _ Most of Catalina Island's tourist lodgings are
clustered near Avalon's town center, which patrons might find to be
both a convenience and a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk from the boat dock to the small hotels that hug
Crescent Avenue, but your room is likely to be right on top of the
perpetual, late-night bash that is Avalon's pedestrian plaza.
</P>
<P>
   An establishment slightly inland can provide different
drawbacks. On a recent visit, I sampled the Hotel St. Lauren, a
big, pink, Victorian wedding cake of a hotel at the corner of
Metropole Avenue and Beacon Street. It was comfortable enough, but
Catalina, in favoring electric golf carts over internal-combustion
vehicles, has swapped one form of pollution for another.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean-view room on the second floor here was like having a
box at the Golf Cart 500. The carts continually scream up and down
the hills, all day and late into the night, their overtaxed motors
sounding like electric shavers during a power surge.
</P>
<P>
   For peace and quiet on Catalina _ without having to pay the
steep rates of the incomparable Inn on Mount Ada _ the best option
might be the Zane Grey Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   It perches on a hill above the island's Casino, at the west edge
of Avalon Bay. And Chimes Tower Road, which snakes past its front
door, gets only infrequent traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo's greatest attributes are its location _ the views
are terrific _ and its distinction as the former home of Grey, a
prolific writer of Western novels in the 1910s, '20s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   At that, this place might not be for everyone. It's rustic, with
simple, basic furnishings. It feels old, it smells old ... it is
old _ built at the author's bidding in 1926. Because it was later
converted from home to hotel, most of the guest rooms had to be
retrofitted with bathrooms, and in many cases it was a tight
squeeze. A 5-foot-11 patron is likely to find, for example, a
shower stall that is exactly 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have neither phones nor TVs. Instead, guests who want
to catch a particular show gather by the fireplace in the living
room _ and hope no one has chosen that particular moment to play
the Pueblo's grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat visitors to the Pueblo roll with these quirks, and
perhaps like the place all the more for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's an old building, there are some things we can't
change,'' said general manager Michael Shehabi. ``But everything is
functional, everything works. Sometimes people hear 'rustic' and
they're not sure what they're going to get. We make sure it's super
clean, but the rusticness stays _ we're not going to modernize it
at all. A lot of the guests tell me they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo has 16 guest rooms, seven of which have full ocean
views. Four of the nine canyon-view rooms have private balconies.
It also has something that's hard to come by in Catalina: a pool.
In deference to Grey's legacy, this one is in the shape of an
arrowhead.
</P>
<P>
   Three different sitting areas at the Pueblo provide excellent
views _ two of the bay, one of the scrub-covered hills to the west.
Those views come with a price, in that it's a steep climb from the
town center to here. It can be invigorating on a cool evening, but
if you're not up to it, complimentary taxi service is provided at
scheduled times during the day. (The taxi ride from the boat dock
to the hotel is also complimentary.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the Pueblo's nice touches is that each of the rooms is
named after one of Grey's novels. He produced more than 60 of them,
cranking them out at the rate of about one per month, and wrote
many of them at his home in Altadena or here. Most of the yarns are
moral tales featuring a loner protagonist with a mysterious past
who fights to uphold virtue and protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you stay in a room named for his most popular works
_ ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' (1912) or ``The Vanishing
American'' (1925) _ but you'll find a complete set of them in a
bookshelf in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can find the book that corresponds to your room. Then,
on a still Catalina night, in a room high above the hum of Avalon,
you can settle in with one of these books, and be transported into
Grey's world by words like these: ``There, beside his horse, stood
Lassiter, his dark apparel and the great black gun-sheaths
contrasting singularly with his gentle smile ...'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates at the Zane Grey Pueblo range from $135 to $165 in high
season (June through September). Until June 1, rates range from $80
to $110 on midweek nights, $135 to $165 on weekends. For
information or reservations, call (800) 378-3256 or (310) 510-0966.
The Pueblo's Web site is difficult to find and fairly unsatisfying
when you finally get there (it doesn't show pictures of individual
rooms, for example, as most lodging Web sites do). Go to
www.virtualcities.com, then click on ``Bed &AMP; Breakfast'' under
First Traveler's Choice. Then click on ``California,'' and scroll
down to ``Islands Off the Coast'' to find the Zane Grey Pueblo
entry. &QL;

 PERSONALS: The Swiss Architects and the UT Museum
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file.) &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Metropolis story about the diversity of opinion on Herzog &AMP; de
Meuron's plans for the new de Young museum mentioned that in
November, the Swiss firm had quit designing an art museum for the
University of Texas in Austin with ``spectacularly bad blood on
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   This sent Personals scurrying to the Austin American-Statesman,
which described the debacle and included several hilarious local
columns. But proponents of the new de Young can relax: The
villains, at least as reported in Texas papers, were the regents
displeased with the selection committee's choice of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The regents wondered a) Why couldn't they have a good old
American firm design the museum? b) Why did the structure have to
be so modern? Couldn't the museum be designed to fit in with older
buildings on campus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a big problem with flat roofs,'' said one regent when
viewing the original design. ``I have a flat roof on my house. I
wouldn't want a flat roof,'' said another. The architects
redesigned the structure to have a curved roof, but complaints
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Beverly Hillbillies vs. Bauhaus'' was the headline over a
column by the newspaper's  &UR; Michael Barnes &LR; , who called the
architects' resignation ``a victory of the modern Texas version of
the Know Nothing Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The regents' shortsighted opinions have resulted in blackening
the growing reputation of the arts at the University of Texas
throughout the world,'' said art department professor
 &UR; Michael Mogavero &LR;  at a protest rally after the architects resigned.
Architecture Dean  &UR; Larry Speck &LR;  quit a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist  &UR; John Kelso &LR;  suggested that if the regents wanted a
design that looked familiar, ``why don't they build an art museum
that looks like a Dairy Queen?'' As for the regents themselves,
``What do these people know about architecture?'' asked Kelso. One
regent's resume, he noted, states that he is an `` `avid
fisherman.' Great. Just what we need. An art museum that looks like
Roy Bob's Bait &AMP; Tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the regents changed the procedure that had mandated
a selection committee, and gave themselves total power to decide on
architects.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ARTISTS FOR HILLARY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rudolph Giuliani &LR; 's attempt to cut off museum funds over the
``Sensation'' art at the recent Brooklyn show has apparently had
political repercussions among artists.
</P>
<P>
   A May 23 fund-raising auction for the first lady's senatorial
campaign is being supported by the likes of  &UR; Yoko Ono &LR; ,  &UR; Robert &LR; 
 &UR; Rauschenberg &LR; ,  &UR; Christo &LR; ,  &UR; Frank Stella &LR; ,  &UR; Richard Serra &LR; ,  &UR; Julian &LR;

 &UR; Goldin &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is an anti-Giuliani factor to this enormous
response from the art community,'' &UR; Chuck Close &LR;  told the New York
Daily News. Giuliani ``is a bit of a dull monkey,'' said &UR; Larry &LR; 
 &UR; Rivers &LR; . ``Rudy's trying to come across as nuts but honest, and I
think generally that's not a bad combination. But now he's
wrestling with subjects that are a little too complex for him.''

   _ First, some nominations for a new name for the Faked Outrage
Hall of Fame, as proposed herein last week:  &UR; Tamsen Armstrong &LR;

and ``is shocked to find that gambling is going on!'' And
 &UR; Tony Enos &LR;  suggests the Doubtraged Community.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who says money can't buy you `Friends?'' joked Scott Sassa,
NBC West Coast President, as the popular long-running comedy was
officially renewed for two seasons on Monday, when the network
announced its up-front presentation of the upcoming fall season.
OK, so it was a short national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Each cast member will receive $750,000 per episode, as well as a
healthy chunk of future profits from syndication. Sources suggested
that had the cast not budged from its $1 million-per-episode
demand, the network was prepared to walk away from negotiations. Of
course, with syndication money, which comes from the production
company and not the network, each star will earn around $40 million
per year rather than a mere pittance of $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also announced the remainder of its new fall schedule in New
York with spectacle high and low, from the cast of ``Will &AMP; Grace''
performing a mini-opera to embattled sock-puppet Triumph the Insult
Comic Dog slagging last year's scheduling of ``Stark Raving Mad''
before ``ER.'' ``That's like saying, `We've got some Alpo Supreme
for you, but first you've got to drink out of this toilet,'''
taunted Triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Friends,'' three other series given
multiple-year deals. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' was guaranteed two more
years. ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``ER,'' the long-running, Emmy-winning
cop and medical shows, respectively, were each renewed for four
more years apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a breakdown of the network's strengths and weaknesses,
and how the new programming should enhance its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Strong points: Despite being No. 2 in the ratings, NBC has
arguably the strongest overall programming schedule, with quality
shows appealing to young and upscale viewers. In addition to strong
Tuesdays and its Must-See Thursday, NBC strengthened Wednesdays and
Fridays last season with new shows like ``The West Wing'' and ``Law
&AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Weak points: NBC's strong evenings proved vulnerable in the past
year, with Tuesday and Thursday fortresses crumbling a smidgen
under ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' siege. Mondays,
Saturdays and Sundays all took a pounding, and, like every other
network except Fox last year, the network struggled in comedy
development. Only ``Daddio,'' a coolly received family comedy,
survived the season. Its best comedy hope of the midseason series,
the poorly titled but hilarious ``M.Y.O.B.,'' is getting burned off
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   New this fall season: On Mondays, ``Law &AMP; Order'' creator Dick
Wolf contributes his third series to the network, ``Deadline,''
starring Oliver Platt as a newspaper columnist and journalism
professor who enlists his students on investigative stories.
Tuesdays see the arrival of three new comedies: ``The Michael
Richards Show,'' in which the former ``Seinfeld'' sidekick plays a
bumbling private investigator; ``Tucker,'' sort of ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' four or five years later; and ``DAG,'' starring David Alan
Grier as a Secret Service Agent forced to protect the First Lady
(Delta Burke). Both ``Richards'' and ``Tucker'' are single camera,
no-laugh-track comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling returns to prime-time soap operas with the new
Wednesday series ``Titans,'' in which one of the subplots features
a father and son battling over Yasmine Bleeth. On Thursdays, the
tentatively titled ``The Steven Weber Show'' stars the former
``Wings'' actor as a man whose life becomes Murphy's Law writ large
when a blind date goes awry and the woman casts a spell on him.
Sunday's new series, ``Ed,'' from ``Late Show with David
Letterman'' head writer Rob Burnett, is a sort of ``Providence''
meets ``Northern Exposure,'' as a lawyer returns from the big city
to his small, eccentric hometown and buys a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling changes: ``Frasier'' got bounced out of its cushy
Must-See Thursday slot at 9 p.m. in order to make room for
up-and-comer ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' with ``Just Shoot Me'' tagging along
for the ride (it'll air at 9:30 p.m. on Thursdays). ``Frasier''
moved to Tuesday, where it will have to anchor a trio of untested
new comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason replacements: Steven Spielberg exec-produces the
Marine drama ``Semper Fi,'' starring Scott Bairstow and Vicellous
Reon Shannon. Tony winner Kristin Chenoweth stars as a wholesome
Midwestern girl working for a crass Big Apple tycoon in
``Kristin.'' ``American Pie's'' co-creator Adam Herz exec-produces
the high school comedy ``Go Fish.'' In the hourlong dramedy ``News
from the Edge,'' a young reporter goes to work for a supermarket
tabloid, only to discover that all its stories about alien love
children and ratboys are true. And three sisters (Vicki Lewis, A.J.
Langer and Katherine LaNasa) find all routes lead to Los Angeles in
the comedy ``These Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Other programming: NBC (along with cable channels CNBC and MSNBC
and their attendant websites) will present a whopping 437 hours of
coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics from Sydney, Australia.
Upcoming mini-series include ``A Man in Full,'' based on Tom
Wolfe's best-selling behemoth, and ``Jackie, Ethel and Joan: The
Women of Camelot,'' based on the book about the women of the
Kennedy dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis: A couple of years ago, when ``3rd Rock from the Sun''
was a huge hit, the network moved it to a different night and
surrounded it with so-so comedies, which spelled the end of its
ratings dominance. We're not saying that will happen with
``Frasier'' on Tuesdays, but they're already reshooting the pilot
for the wan-looking ``The Michael Richards Show.'' And ``DAG''
looks far too broad to be a comfortable companion series with
Kelsey Grammar's urbane comedy of manners. ``Tucker'' may have been
a better fit with the family-oriented ``Daddio'' on Monday nights,
which would've left ``3rd Rock'' (which has been moved around too
much for any series to flourish) on Tuesdays and given NBC more of
an established presence for the evening (the network no doubt
wanted to keep its single-camera comedies in a bloc).
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdays, the ``guilty pleasure'' (NBC's words) ``Titans''
is a curious lead-in indeed for the bracingly intelligent ``The
West Wing.'' The quirky, seriocomic ``Ed'' would seem a better fit
for the equally seriocomic ``West Wing,'' and ``Titans'' just feels
like a big, brash Sunday night show. Overall, though, the lineup
shows a lot of promise _ ``The Steven Weber Show'' looks like a
rarity, a genuinely funny comedy shoehorned in amidst the Must-See
Thursday hits, and ``Ed'' and ``Deadline'' looking particularly
strong, though they're stranded in competitive timeslots.
September's Olympics coverage will be a monumental aide in
promoting the entire new schedule.

IT'S ALL IN THE PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen is talking about how he had contemplated becoming a
criminal before he turned to comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm being facetious when I say I had toyed with
the fact of a life of crime... At first I had thought about going
into law enforcement but (in those days) there were height
requirements. So then I turned to the idea of being a crook where
there were no height requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The riff sounds a lot like something from the stand-up comedian
Allen of the '60s. But instead of a coffeehouse, the Oscar-winning
director was in town last week to offer some lessons and warnings
about the filmmaking business to an audience of students and others
at UCLA's Wadsworth Theatre. He also screened his new film, aptly
titled ``Small Time Crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is the tale of an ex-con dishwasher (Ray Winkler,
played by Allen) in New York City who has a scheme to rob a bank
and get enough money so he and his manicurist wife, Frenchy,
(Tracey Ulman) can move to Florida in luxury. The plot is
reminiscent of Allen's first directorial achievement, the 1969 film
``Take the Money and Run,'' where he played an inept compulsive
criminal named Virgil Starkwell.
</P>
<P>
   When it's suggested that Ray is Virgil aged gracefully, Allen
responds, ``I have aged gracefully. I look good (audience laughs).
!ital!I do.!'' he insists, sounding again like one of his
characters. ``I'll be 65 in December. My father will be 100 this
year. We have youthful genes. I have no face work whatsoever. I
have good energy.'' Then he gets down to business, talking about
filmmaking. ``Take the Money and Run'' was made my a young person
and operates by gag by gag by gag, and fortunately there were
enough gags to keep the film afloat. ``Small Time Crooks'' is a
film that operates on character, and the characters are suppose to
be funny so you don't have to go on a frenetic surrealistic pace
all the time.'' Adding that ``it's a film by a more competant
gracefully aged filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is Allen's 31st film (he makes about one a
year) and is being distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. The film is
lighter fare than Allen has turned out in recent years, most of
which have drawn critical praise but little at the box office. Best
known for ``Annie Hall,'' which took four Oscars, including Best
Picture, Allen has had few real hits since. His 1986 ``Hannah and
Her Sisters'' being a notable exception. He picked up a
screenwriting Oscar for that one, and Dianne Weist and Michael
Caine won best supporting acting awards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ``Celebrity'' with a post ``Titanic'' Leonardo DiCaprio
took in only $5 million, and last year's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' made
$4.5 million despite Oscar nominations for stars Sean Penn and
Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't seem to bother Allen, whose films are low
budget and eventually make a profit when the overseas box office
and video are factored in. He admits that some people see his films
as being the same (``Oh, another Woody Allen movie''). For him,
they're all different _ murder mysteries, musicals, comedies,
dramas _ but other ``feel there's a sameness to them, the way one
could say there are 500 different Chinese dishes, but it's all
Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allen making movies is about ``trying to make art head on.''
And awards don't mean anything. Though being a 22-time Oscar
nominee and four-time winner he's never attended the Academy
Awards.(``I don't believe in competition among !ital!alleged works
of art.'') Ultimately, he says, he wants to please himself. His
first screenplay was the 1965 film ``What's New Pussycat,'' the
Hollywood process soured him and he vowed never to go that route
again.
</P>
<P>
   But making a film, he tells the audience of perspective
filmmakers in a question and answer session, is no picnic for him.
(``I'm in trouble almost all the time on films.'')
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the writing. He says that inspiration can come
from anywhere, and if he has no inspiration he'll sit in a room and
think for hours. ``I use to write for television and that's the way
you had to do it because the show had to go on and eventually
something comes up.''
   But he quickly warns that you can get a million ideas that sound
good but 50 pages down the line you're stuck. ``It's very important
for me to see where the thing goes before I write it; otherwise you
end up with a charming idea that just runs out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's suggested that shooting the film would be more fun.
Allen looks slightly aghast. ``Making a film. That's not fun,
either. Making it, you're out there at six in the morning, and it's
freezing and everyone is saying hurry up, hurry up it's costing us
money, and the actor or actress is late to the set, and jokes
aren't working and the sun is in the wrong position and the
cameraman is having a tantrum. This'' he stresses, ``is not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what about the post-production process?
</P>
<P>
   ``Editing is fun until you get your first cut ... then it's like
taking a cold shower,'' he says. ``You look at your first cut, and
you realize how god awful your work is really going to be and
there's no way out of it....''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes on to describe what must be the dream and reality
of many a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I start a film ... I'm thinking that this film will be so
much greater than the `Bicycle Thief,' so much greater than `Grand
Illusion' that the world will finally realize what an intense, deep
genius I am. Then when I see that first cut of the film, I'm
thinking, `God, just let me survive.' I'll do anything. I'll take
the end of the film and put it at the front.... I'll dub voices.
I'll do anything so I won't suffer a catastrophic embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the gamble,'' he warns the aspiring filmmakers in
the audience.``It's very rare that you have a pleasurable
experience. Just so you know. In case you want to change your
major.''
</P>
<P>
   As for working with actors, Allen finds that a more pleasuable
experience, and despite the low budgets on his film, the Hollywood
elite are happy to take part. Besides, DiCaprio, Penn and Caine,
Julia Roberts Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Tracey Ullman and Kenneth
Branagh have all appeared in Allen films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pay a very low amount, shockingly low. Everybody
that works, whether it's Julia Roberts or Sean Penn or whoever it
is gets the same $5,000 a week. Whether they get $10 million on
another picture, they get $50,000 for our picture, and that's our
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says he gives the script to the actors and get their
input. ``I tell them they can make changes as long as they make the
scene happen believably.... If they screw up I correct them, but
more often than not I'm working with first-rate actors and they do
a great job, better than I could do, and in the end I get the
credit for it.'' Dressed in a sweater and slacks, Allen appeared
very much like he does in his films, which raised another question
that vexes the filmmaker: That his onscreen persona is him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't me though,'' Allen insists. ``I've been knocking at
doors for 30 years telling people that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says that the confusion over his onscreen characters and
offscreen life stem from the fact that he looks the same. Unlike
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx who had
onscreen characters different from their offscreen lives, ``I wear
the same clothes off screen as I do on screen. And I looked like
the same character in my real life as I do on screen. But I'm not
the same character.
</P>
<P>
   ``In really life I'm very competant, I'm very disciplined, hard
working and resonably calm. In movies I'm frenetic, I'm
hyper-neurotic and involved in extreme situations that never happen
to me in my real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Allen's life has been the subject of tabloids. His
scandalous relationship in 1992 with Soon-Yi Previn, his then 18
years old adopted daughter and the subsequent combative breakup
with actress Mia Farrow made him a villian in some people's eyes.
But today, the controversy has lost its sting, and no one in the
audience brought it up. A couple of women even thanked his for
making films that showed women in a real way, citing his 1988 film
``Another Woman''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Marx, Allen remembered having lunch with him years
ago and thinking ``that this guy was like a Jewish uncle in my
family. No different.... And I thought if I acheive the greatness
I'd like to... that's what really what it is in the end. You lose
your teeth; you make those wisecracks to waitresses... you can see
where I'm going with this.'' But morbidity aside, Allen doesn't
show signs of slowing down. More films are in the works. Last year,
he and adopted a baby daughter, 14-month old Bechet, and recently
moved into an Upper East Side townhouse in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And he's achieved his original goal (``I just wanted something
that would keep me interested my whole life''), even if it wasn't
as a card cheat or a safe cracker.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling that despite why Allen isn't a
small-time crook, he sees himself as one in the world of art, never
quite measuring up to the Ingmar Bergmans and Francois Truffauts,
giants of filmmaking (``real heavy stuff.''), that he so admires.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what keeps Allen going, always hoping the next film
will be a masterpiece. But there is one thing he's given us that
Bergman hasn't, a lot of laughs, and if the resounding applause
from the audience at UCLA is any indication, that counts big time.

POLLUTION LAWS DO LITTLE TO AID CHINA'S TROUBLED WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUAIROU, China _ The nadir of Zhang Jinhu's career occurred in
the fall, when thousands of his ducks unsteadily waddled out of the
Huai River with singed feathers and burned feet, became paralyzed
and died.
</P>
<P>
   A prosperous farmer with a flock of 4,000 birds, Zhang had
weathered the sporadic deaths of some ducks from caustic river
water over the last few years. But he was not used to this sort of
prolonged carnage, which culminated one day in September, when
several hundred died.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that pollution in the sudsy green river killed the
ducks. In Huairou, on the northern outskirts of Beijing, Zhang said
he believed that he knew the culprit: chemicals from an upstream
pig farm.
</P>
<P>
   But in this relatively poor and extremely polluted country,
there is often no simple remedy for the millions of people like
Zhang hurt badly by pollution. Though China has enacted strict
anti-pollution laws in the last decade, enforcement is still lax in
many places. Flagrant violations occur without so much as an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Zhang is suing the farm for compensation. His is one
of a small but growing number of environmental suits by pollution
victims that may become test cases.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to a new legal aid center in Beijing after local
government agencies gave him little satisfaction in the matter of
the duck deaths, which he calculates cost him $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deputy chief of the local environmental protection bureau
came and said they were powerless to correct it unless we could
isolate the source of the pollution,'' Zhang said as he
chain-smoked in the tin-roofed shack that he built on the
riverbank. ``But I'm just a farmer. How can I do that? There are
lots of things that dump waste water into this river, mostly in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Canfa, who opened the legal aid office, the Center for
Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims, last fall, said, ``China has
many laws and regulations regarding the environment, but the
situation just gets worse, because they are often not
implemented.'' The center, the first in China, is affiliated with
the Law and Politics University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's rivers are some of the dirtiest in the world. And an
aggressive central government campaign to identify and punish
polluters has failed to penetrate fully the vast rural areas, where
anti-pollution laws are often blithely ignored by local
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Police are often reluctant to prosecute such businesses because
they are the cornerstones of the local economies and, in many
cases, are owned by the local government.
</P>
<P>
   Also, investigations are often prohibitively expensive for local
agencies and politically complicated, because the sources of river
pollution may be in other jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   And those who suffer the most are often people who are
frequently unaware of the hazards and their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand the law or how to go about getting the
problem solved,'' Wang said. ``So polluters are not afraid, and
they keep skirting the law.''
</P>
<P>
   For three months, the news media have reported many cases of
serious unchecked water pollution. In central Anhui Province, a
spill devastated fish along a 15-mile stretch of the Haozhouguo
River, destroying the livelihoods of 179 families. In Leshan,
Sichuan Province, in the southwest, extensive fish deaths along 135
miles of the Minjiang River followed a chemical spill. No suits
have been filed and no compensation paid.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the Center for Legal Assistance to
Pollution Victims is receiving more than 100 calls a month, mostly
from workers and farmers who have read the newspaper advertisements
of the center. Zhang, the duck farmer, was among the first to call.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said many farmers had been economically devastated by the
river pollution, which peaked in fall. They complained but said
they seemed to have little recourse.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the pollution has been a severe drought, which
has lowered water levels, concentrating contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhang built his ramshackle complex of huts and pens to
raise ducks, it was on a bank of a river 330 feet wide. Today, the
river snakes a narrow winding path down the middle of a vast sandy
bed.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Zhang used to swim and bathe in the Huai. Even five
years ago, he said, a fisherman could catch 300 pounds of fish a
day. But in the last year, the fish and river grass have died. So
do cows and pigs if they drink river water. ``If people go in, they
get covered with scabs,'' Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Chinese government has acknowledged
problems with law enforcement and has buttressed its inspection
system, particularly along the seven major rivers. Nationwide, the
enforcement division has rapidly grown, to its current 30,000, with
plans to expand to 40,000 to 50,000 by 2002. In 1998, 39,754
polluters were penalized, mostly through fines. In addition, the
Environmental Protection Administration took 621 cases to court and
obtained 579 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've strengthened our enforcement to make sure they meet
standards,'' said Chen Shanrong, deputy director of the
environmental inspection and supervision division in the
administration. But he added, ``We still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although such efforts have helped control industrial pollution
in some places, they have often had little effect on situations
like Zhang's, an environmental disaster in a small river with local
effects, where the suspected polluters are small companies that
enjoy good relations with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chinese law, environmental protection is primarily the
responsibility of local authorities, with the national
administration providing just backup support. Chen acknowledged
that there were ``local officials who, in order to follow their own
interests, don't cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling pollution-control efforts have largely focused on
industrial polluters, and government agencies are only starting to
look at agricultural wastes like the chemicals that Zhang believes
killed his ducks. Such chemicals can be harder to monitor, because
they enter the water through seepage, not by obvious effluent
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhang's ducks started dying, he unsuccessfully appealed to
every local agency he thought might be inclined to help, the local
government, the county environmental protection bureau and even the
township women's organization. He carried duck carcasses to the
local fish and wildlife office for autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   He and other farmers in the area have focused their attention on
the pig farm, because ducks upstream had no problem in the fall,
while ducks downstream died en masse.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Zhang's pleas, workers from the local
environmental protection bureau arrived and tested the river water
and found it highly alkaline. But they went no further in
determining the nature of the pollution or its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even been able to figure out who owns the pig
farm,'' Zhang said. ``I don't think anyone investigated really.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, the lawyer, said that the farm was partly owned by the
government of an upstream village and that the Huairou
environmental protection bureau had ``taken up some, but not all''
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely to do more without further pressure, he
said, adding: ``Local businesses pay taxes and are big employers.
So local governments need them and are reluctant to close them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wang has great hope that suits like Zhang's will change
that, creating new incentives to fight pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew that victims might claim compensation, that would
bring huge pressure on polluters, who would have to start paying a
price for their actions,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, it would be a hard battle, because such suits
are relatively new in China. Zhang's case will be first heard in a
local court here. But it can be appealed to a higher court in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Zhang's neighbors who lost ducks are watching and say
they will file their own suits if he succeeds. Zhang is not holding
his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already sold the 200 ducks that remained,'' he said,
wandering through empty pens to a smelly shack fitted with
floor-to-ceiling cages, home to his new bird business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've switched to quails,'' he said. ``It's safer. They never
go near water.''

   Six British Areas Change Phone Codes
</P>
<P>
   Telephone numbers in London and some other parts of Britain have
changed _ the third time in 10 years for London. The last time
London numbers were changed the Office of Telecommunications said
it expected no further changes, but it apparently did not foresee
the demand for new numbers caused by the Internet, fax machines and
the explosion in cell phone use.
</P>
<P>
   The area codes for London, Cardiff, Coventry, Portsmouth,
Southampton and Northern Ireland have changed from 1 to 2. After
dialing 44 (the country code for Britain), callers to these areas
from the United States now dial 2 _ followed by local codes that
have also been changed. The local code is followed by the old
personal number (seven digits in London). In Northern Ireland the
28 is followed by one of more than 30 revised district codes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new codes in the six areas are now in use, although the old
codes will continue to work until later in the year. More
information about code changes is available at
www.numberchange.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, when making a local call in London you prefix the
existing number with a 7 (for a 207 number) or an 8 (for the 208
area). When not dialing locally but within Britain you need a zero
before the 2.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for all cell-phone, pager and personal numbers in
Britain are also changing, but existing numbers will work until
April 28, 2001. After that they will be prefixed by a 7.

   French Impressionists At the National Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Many first-time visitors to Argenteuil have a sense of deja vu:
they recognize parts of the small town on the banks of the Seine
northwest of Paris from the many paintings Monet, Manet,
Caillebotte, Renoir, Sisley and Boudin made there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 of those paintings can be seen in ``The
Impressionists at Argenteuil,'' the first exhibition to focus on
the second most important site, after Paris, in the development of
Impressionism. It opens at the National Gallery of Art in
Washington on May 28 and travels to Hartford this summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monet started it all when he moved to Argenteuil for six years
in 1871. His Impressionist colleagues would often come to visit.
Inspired by the town's rustic charm, they painted its towpaths,
railway bridges, gardens, factories, sailboats, regattas, each
other and their families. At Monet's house in Argenteuil the group
planned what became the first Impressionist exhibition, which took
place in 1874. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The painters often worked together, capturing the same scene
side by side, and the exhibition includes several pairings:
``Sailboats at Argenteuil'' by Monet and Renoir; Caillebotte's
``Argenteuil Bridge and the Seine'' and Monet's ``Highway Bridge
and Boat Basin;'' and a cluster of trees in Boudin's ``Seine at
Argenteuil'' and Monet's ``Promenade at Argenteuil.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show remains in Washington until Aug. 20, then moves to the
Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Sept. 9 through Dec. 3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery, on the National Mall between Third and
Ninth Streets at Constitution Avenue NW, is open daily. Admission
is free. Information: (202) 737-4215 or www.nga.gov. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main St., is open May 23 through
Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dated and timed tickets, costing $17, are
available by calling (877) 600-6246. General information: (860)
278-2670 or www.wadsworthatheneum.org.

   Japan Abolishes Its 3 Percent Tourism Tax
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Japan has become slightly less expensive with the
abolition of a local 3 percent tourism tax. The tax, which for more
than 40 years was applied to hotel rooms that cost more than about
$140 and meals of more than about $70, was discontinued on April 1.
Now only a countrywide 5 percent consumption tax and a tax of about
$1.30 a day for hot-spring use at some major resorts remain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Japan National Tourist Organization likens the consumption
tax with the 6 percent or more sales taxes in many states, the
value added taxes of 10 percent or more in Europe, and the New York
City hotel tax of 13.25 percent. The consumption tax can be avoided
on goods costing more than about $94 when bought at tax-free
stores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the tourist organization reported that about
700,000 Americans visited Japan last year, and she observed that
throughout Japan tipping is not expected in hotels, restaurants or
taxis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information about traveling to Japan is available at (212)
757-5641 in New York, (312) 222-0874 in Chicago and (213) 623-1952
in Los Angeles or on the Web at www.japantravelinfo.com.

   Face to Face With the Fishes in Keiko's Old Haunt
</P>
<P>
   Any kid can tell you: the moment you leave for college, your
bedroom is converted into something else. The same thing has
happened to Keiko the killer whale.
</P>
<P>
   The seagoing celebrity of ``Free Willy'' and ``Free Willy II''
spent nearly three years at the Oregon Coast Aquarium, cavorting in
a custom-made two-million-gallon tank and preparing for his
eventual release into the wild. In September 1998, he left for
college _ that is, he was sent to Iceland, where he is undergoing
more intense training before being freed, possibly this summer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keiko's presence gave the 10,200 residents of Newport, Ore., a
huge economic boost. But once their cash cow was gone, they were
stuck with a white elephant, in the form of an enormous, empty
tank. What to do? Turn the bedroom into something else, of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opening on May 27 is the $6.9 million Passages of the Deep
exhibit. Keiko's tank has been converted into three large ocean
habitats connected by a 200-foot underwater acrylic tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can walk through the tunnel, passing from Orford Reef,
depicting the habitat just off the southern Oregon coast; to
Halibut Flats, farther offshore; and the shark-infested Open Sea.
Vegetation and marine life particular to those habitats populate
the three different areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The acrylic tunnel is suspended eight feet below the surface and
eight feet from the bottom of the tank. Wave action, a sunken ship
and thousands of fish contribute to the undersea experience. There
are several 360-degree viewing areas, where visitors will always
have lots of fish in sight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium is open every day except May 21 and Dec. 25. Hours
from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend are 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. Winter hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $9.25, $8.25 for seniors, $4.75 for ages 4 to 13,
and free for children under 4. For more information, call (541)
867-3474 or visit the Web site at www.aquarium.org.

IT'S ALL IN THE PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woody Allen is talking about how he had contemplated becoming a
criminal before he turned to comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm being facetious when I say I had toyed with
the fact of a life of crime... At first I had thought about going
into law enforcement but (in those days) there were height
requirements. So then I turned to the idea of being a crook where
there were no height requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The riff sounds a lot like something from the stand-up comedian
Allen of the '60s. But instead of a coffeehouse, the Oscar-winning
director was in town last week to offer some lessons and warnings
about the filmmaking business to an audience of students and others
at UCLA's Wadsworth Theatre. He also screened his new film, aptly
titled ``Small Time Crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is the tale of an ex-con dishwasher (Ray Winkler,
played by Allen) in New York City who has a scheme to rob a bank
and get enough money so he and his manicurist wife, Frenchy,
(Tracey Ulman) can move to Florida in luxury. The plot is
reminiscent of Allen's first directorial achievement, the 1969 film
``Take the Money and Run,'' where he played an inept compulsive
criminal named Virgil Starkwell.
</P>
<P>
   When it's suggested that Ray is Virgil aged gracefully, Allen
responds, ``I have aged gracefully. I look good (audience laughs).
!ital!I do.!'' he insists, sounding again like one of his
characters. ``I'll be 65 in December. My father will be 100 this
year. We have youthful genes. I have no face work whatsoever. I
have good energy.'' Then he gets down to business, talking about
filmmaking. ``Take the Money and Run'' was made my a young person
and operates by gag by gag by gag, and fortunately there were
enough gags to keep the film afloat. ``Small Time Crooks'' is a
film that operates on character, and the characters are suppose to
be funny so you don't have to go on a frenetic surrealistic pace
all the time.'' Adding that ``it's a film by a more competant
gracefully aged filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is Allen's 31st film (he makes about one a
year) and is being distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. The film is
lighter fare than Allen has turned out in recent years, most of
which have drawn critical praise but little at the box office. Best
known for ``Annie Hall,'' which took four Oscars, including Best
Picture, Allen has had few real hits since. His 1986 ``Hannah and
Her Sisters'' being a notable exception. He picked up a
screenwriting Oscar for that one, and Dianne Weist and Michael
Caine won best supporting acting awards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ``Celebrity'' with a post ``Titanic'' Leonardo DiCaprio
took in only $5 million, and last year's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' made
$4.5 million despite Oscar nominations for stars Sean Penn and
Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't seem to bother Allen, whose films are low
budget and eventually make a profit when the overseas box office
and video are factored in. He admits that some people see his films
as being the same (``Oh, another Woody Allen movie''). For him,
they're all different _ murder mysteries, musicals, comedies,
dramas _ but other ``feel there's a sameness to them, the way one
could say there are 500 different Chinese dishes, but it's all
Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   For Allen making movies is about ``trying to make art head on.''
And awards don't mean anything. Though being a 22-time Oscar
nominee and four-time winner he's never attended the Academy
Awards.(``I don't believe in competition among !ital!alleged works
of art.'') Ultimately, he says, he wants to please himself. His
first screenplay was the 1965 film ``What's New Pussycat,'' the
Hollywood process soured him and he vowed never to go that route
again.
</P>
<P>
   But making a film, he tells the audience of perspective
filmmakers in a question and answer session, is no picnic for him.
(``I'm in trouble almost all the time on films.'')
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the writing. He says that inspiration can come
from anywhere, and if he has no inspiration he'll sit in a room and
think for hours. ``I use to write for television and that's the way
you had to do it because the show had to go on and eventually
something comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly warns that you can get a million ideas that sound
good but 50 pages down the line you're stuck. ``It's very important
for me to see where the thing goes before I write it; otherwise you
end up with a charming idea that just runs out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's suggested that shooting the film would be more fun.
Allen looks slightly aghast. ``Making a film. That's not fun,
either. Making it, you're out there at six in the morning, and it's
freezing and everyone is saying hurry up, hurry up it's costing us
money, and the actor or actress is late to the set, and jokes
aren't working and the sun is in the wrong position and the
cameraman is having a tantrum. This'' he stresses, ``is not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what about the post-production process?
</P>
<P>
   ``Editing is fun until you get your first cut ... then it's like
taking a cold shower,'' he says. ``You look at your first cut, and
you realize how god awful your work is really going to be and
there's no way out of it....''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes on to describe what must be the dream and reality
of many a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I start a film ... I'm thinking that this film will be so
much greater than the `Bicycle Thief,' so much greater than `Grand
Illusion' that the world will finally realize what an intense, deep
genius I am. Then when I see that first cut of the film, I'm
thinking, `God, just let me survive.' I'll do anything. I'll take
the end of the film and put it at the front.... I'll dub voices.
I'll do anything so I won't suffer a catastrophic embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the gamble,'' he warns the aspiring filmmakers in
the audience.``It's very rare that you have a pleasurable
experience. Just so you know. In case you want to change your
major.''
</P>
<P>
   As for working with actors, Allen finds that a more pleasuable
experience, and despite the low budgets on his film, the Hollywood
elite are happy to take part. Besides, DiCaprio, Penn and Caine,
Julia Roberts Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Tracey Ullman and Kenneth
Branagh have all appeared in Allen films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pay a very low amount, shockingly low. Everybody
that works, whether it's Julia Roberts or Sean Penn or whoever it
is gets the same $5,000 a week. Whether they get $10 million on
another picture, they get $50,000 for our picture, and that's our
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says he gives the script to the actors and get their
input. ``I tell them they can make changes as long as they make the
scene happen believably.... If they screw up I correct them, but
more often than not I'm working with first-rate actors and they do
a great job, better than I could do, and in the end I get the
credit for it.'' Dressed in a sweater and slacks, Allen appeared
very much like he does in his films, which raised another question
that vexes the filmmaker: That his onscreen persona is him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't me though,'' Allen insists. ``I've been knocking at
doors for 30 years telling people that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen says that the confusion over his onscreen characters and
offscreen life stem from the fact that he looks the same. Unlike
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx who had
onscreen characters different from their offscreen lives, ``I wear
the same clothes off screen as I do on screen. And I looked like
the same character in my real life as I do on screen. But I'm not
the same character.
</P>
<P>
   ``In really life I'm very competant, I'm very disciplined, hard
working and resonably calm. In movies I'm frenetic, I'm
hyper-neurotic and involved in extreme situations that never happen
to me in my real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Allen's life has been the subject of tabloids. His
scandalous relationship in 1992 with Soon-Yi Previn, his then 18
years old adopted daughter and the subsequent combative breakup
with actress Mia Farrow made him a villian in some people's eyes.
But today, the controversy has lost its sting, and no one in the
audience brought it up. A couple of women even thanked his for
making films that showed women in a real way, citing his 1988 film
``Another Woman''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Marx, Allen remembered having lunch with him years
ago and thinking ``that this guy was like a Jewish uncle in my
family. No different.... And I thought if I acheive the greatness
I'd like to... that's what really what it is in the end. You lose
your teeth; you make those wisecracks to waitresses... you can see
where I'm going with this.'' But morbidity aside, Allen doesn't
show signs of slowing down. More films are in the works. Last year,
he and adopted a baby daughter, 14-month old Bechet, and recently
moved into an Upper East Side townhouse in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And he's achieved his original goal (``I just wanted something
that would keep me interested my whole life''), even if it wasn't
as a card cheat or a safe cracker.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling that despite why Allen isn't a
small-time crook, he sees himself as one in the world of art, never
quite measuring up to the Ingmar Bergmans and Francois Truffauts,
giants of filmmaking (``real heavy stuff.''), that he so admires.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what keeps Allen going, always hoping the next film
will be a masterpiece. But there is one thing he's given us that
Bergman hasn't, a lot of laughs, and if the resounding applause
from the audience at UCLA is any indication, that counts big time.

   `IKES' ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   Older people surf the Web in disproportionate numbers for
shopping, travel and everything else, which, on the Web, really
does mean everything else.
</P>
<P>
   People aged 50 and older made up 21.8 percent of all those who
logged onto the Internet from home last month, according to Nielsen
Net Ratings. And you can read on www.senior.com that people 50 and
older represent 80 percent of the luxury travel bought in the
United States, typically spending 74 percent more on vacations than
people aged 18 to 49. It is not a surprise that they spend more;
they have more: 70- to 74-year-olds, followed by 65- to
69-year-olds, are the richest age groups in America.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the journal American Demographics in 1994, before
the Web was a factor, calls the generation that grew up when Dwight
D. Eisenhower was supreme allied commander and president the
``Ikes,'' and says they ``spend freely on grandchildren, new cars
and homes, and travel.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where do seniors start shopping for travel online? Well,
www.senior.com (pay attention to the name) offers a selection of
articles about travel with links to sites for lodging, cruise lines
and such. Seniors.com (not the same thing) also has articles, but
no links. And www.generationa.com offers articles and travel tips
(``no self-respecting light traveler checks luggage''). You can
also try aarp.org, which has a few travel articles, some with
links, and also offers discounts to members, who must be 50 or
over, that may or may not be better than what you can get just by
asking the establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Any search engine _ Yahoo, Altavista, etc. _ will lead you to
scores of sites for older travelers and everybody else. An
exhaustive guide to all kinds of travel, including travel for
seniors, is at www.specialtytravel.com. Click on the Activity
Index, scroll down to Seniors/Retired, and then pick one of the
scores of countries. Bouncing around, I found six trips in England,
two in Greece and another six in New Zealand. When you select one
that sounds promising, you get a description of what the company
offers and where to get further information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prime site, if you don't mind stretching your brain cells,
is www.elderhostel.org, now celebrating its 25th anniversary. Last
year almost 175,000 people 55 and older visited universities,
national parks, museums and other such places in the United States,
Canada and more than 85 other countries. The programs consist of
one to four weeks of lectures, discussions, field trips and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   A MULTITUDE OF MAPS
</P>
<P>
   I pulled up a map of the small suburban town where I live in
less than a minute on www.mapblast.com, a recently redesigned site
for finding where you are going and how to get there. (Not that
anyone would travel here, but I am more likely to spot errors than
I would on a map of Paris.) If you have a street address, you can
also get driving directions, with up to 10 intermediate stops; the
locations of nationally branded places, like Starbucks; and maps
and driving directions in 41 European countries in nine languages.

ADRIATIC PLEASURES IN ABUNDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 21) 
 By DANIEL LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fresh breeze off the Adriatic sailed into my room, filling the
curtains like spinnakers, and I was instantly awake. If I rose
before dawn, I could explore the cobbled streets of Rovinj at first
light and watch by the harbor while sunrise caught the old town in
high relief: the ancient stone houses, all mass and texture, and
the steep Venetian ones, all line and color, under the equal
protection of a copper St. Euphemia, poised on her bell tower 200
feet in the sky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That there was a serious gap in this mental picture didn't hit
me until I actually went outside. I had imagined, out of tourist's
innocence or vanity, having this town on Croatia's Istrian coast to
myself. Instead, all of Rovinj (pronounced roh-VEEN-yah) was awake
in the half-light, ready to draw me into its own, more purposeful
version of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The town mascots, a family of wry little dogs, were going
someplace with their quick feet on. People dressed for work had
begun talking the day into focus outside three or four waterfront
cafes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the bread shop, an old woman in black read a bulletin board
that says ``death notices'' in Hrvatski and Italian; among these
notici mortuari was the beautiful name of Sonia Caterina Curvo, who
was only 51. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up the street, two kids in baggy jeans were transfixed by a
movie poster: ``Star Wars, Epizoda I,'' here at last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Euphemia herself _ patroness, beacon, weather vane _ had
apparently been on duty all night, and at this hour still glowed in
the spectral light of flood lamps. In a darker quarter below, the
fish market was open, and the produce market next door was already
doing a good business _ here, in one block, were all the required
ingredients for good Istrian cooking. Besides fruits and
vegetables, the stalls had local olives, fragrant green olive oils,
walnuts, dried fruits, wines, grappa, honey, cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   But the big food news this third week of October was native
truffles, black and white, in outrageous abundance. We had lucked
into the heart of the truffle-hunting season. For the next couple
of days, my wife and I could hardly order a meal that didn't
involve some dish full of fungi, sliced, diced and, relatively
speaking, underpriced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Istria, the bit of Croatia that dangles like a heart pendant in
the Adriatic Sea, plays to a wide range of tastes. In the fall and
spring, life runs more nearly true to the old maritime-agricultural
rhythms. These are good times to enjoy the countryside and its food
and excellent wines. If you're partial to stone and mortar, there
are some impressive Byzantine and Roman monuments, too, including
an amphitheater in Pula that's still very much in the business of
spectacles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Istria, a five-hour trip by train and rental car from Venice by
way of Trieste, was an easy fit with our travels in northern Italy.
It is about a six-hour drive from Munich. Because of this general
accessibility, Istria is the most-visited part of Croatia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's also perhaps the least typical in its outlook. In the
national elections of 1993, when Croatia's xenophobic Franjo
Tudjman was at the height of presidential power, his political
party essentially had to concede Istria County to the local
opposition; the Istrian Democratic Assembly got 73 percent of the
vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Istria was too far away to hear a shot fired in
the brutal disintegration of Yugoslavia. But its economy was
affected and has yet to recover. Big British travel packagers, who
once supplied 20 percent of the tourists, took their business
elsewhere. Today, only 2 percent of foreign visitors are British
(even fewer are American). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming in from Italy, through a little piece of Slovenia, we got
a robust greeting as we drove into the Istrian hills: billboards
for Super Bingo, and for the seaside resorts of Umag and Porec,
where tens of thousands of hotel rooms and camping sites are strung
along miles of shoreline. We weren't going there, having already
decided not to spend our three-night visit hopping from point to
point. Besides enjoying the sea, air and historic architecture in
Rovinj, which would be our base, all we had in mind was a day in
Pula, Istria's principal city and repository of its epic history,
and part of a day in the uplands around the medieval towns Groznjan
and Motovun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These hills of north and central Istria _ actually, foothills of
the Julian Alps _ recall what ``rustic'' looked like before the
term became self-conscious. You will get the inevitable photo op of
the Mercedes blowing past the grape-laden donkey cart.

   Among the hill towns, Groznjan, especially, has enhanced its
blunt charm and long pastoral views with a cultural life that
includes music camps, art galleries and an international film
academy. But there are many places where you can still look across
a valley that's been worked in the same cycles for a thousand
years, or buy a bottle of wine from the family that picked the
grapes. Distance from the noise and cultural flattening of
mega-Europe is not the least of Istria's off-season charms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good vantage point is the high town of Motovun, overlooking
the Mirna River valley: a steep walk up stone-paved streets,
rewarded by a 360-degree view from the ramparts. The town square
includes the Renaissance St. Stephen Church, with a tower you can
climb for 5 kuna (roughly 60 cents); a cafe; the tidy Hotel Kastel,
and a delightful old movie house, Motovun's own cinema paradiso,
refitted for the inauguration of a mini film festival last summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pula, Istria's largest city, is near the southern tip of the
peninsula _ only a 45-minute drive from our Rovinj hotel, it turned
out. Pula is a haven for Adriatic yachtsmen, but more notably a
ship-building center, and over all a business-minded place. It's
well worth a day's visit seeing what the Romans built there after
their subjugation of the Illyrians _ the first in a series of
occupations by Byzantines, Slavs, Celts, Venetians,
Austro-Hungarians, the French, Italians, Germans and the Allies,
among others, before Istria was awarded to Yugoslavia in 1947.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   We were tooling around the city in a five-speed Fiat, following
the harbor, when the thing we were looking for seemed to find us:
Pula's amphitheater, rising in a leafy, relatively quiet district
of the old city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, to be sure: it's supposed to be the third largest Roman
amphitheater. More impressive are its lofty design and sound
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The amphitheater was built of white limestone in the first
century. Except that its tiers of stone seats were later taken for
use in other construction projects (replaced with wooden benches),
it may look nearly as good today as it did 2,000 years ago, when
guys bashed heads to the cheers of 20,000 spectators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modern Istrians have kept the amphitheater working with film
festivals, operas and rock concerts. But for a part of this mild
October afternoon, we were alone there, scaring ourselves with
thoughts of what it must have been like to stand in the way of a
people that could build such a thing wherever they pleased.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the amphitheater, it's a block or so to Ulica Sergijevaca,
a busy, pedestrian-only street that follows the ring layout of the
original Roman city. Several blocks along, on the northern rim, is
the Triumphal Arch of Sergius, whose unexpectedly intimate scale
and integration into the daily flow of life were a pleasant
surprise. Michelangelo, among many others, came to study the arch's
famous classical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote for Bloomsday-trivia types: the handsome old building
a few feet from the arch was once the Berlitz school where James
Joyce taught English after running away from Ireland with Nora
Barnacle in 1904. While a plaque on the building briefly notes its
association with the ``great Irish author,'' the story is worth a
bit more than that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During his stay in the town, then called Pola, Joyce wrote the
so-called Pola notebook, laying out the esthetic principles that
his character Stephen Dedalus later elaborates in ``A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man.'' The down side was that Pola, the main
base of the Austro-Hungarian navy, was oppressive and suspicious of
foreigners. Joyce called it ``a naval Siberia,'' and before long he
was sent to Trieste, a more cosmopolitan outpost of the empire,
where he stayed until World War I.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one traveling to Pula should pass up the chance to eat at
Valsabbion, located somewhat oddly in an upscale suburban yacht
harbor a few miles south of the central city. We considered our two
meals at Valsabbion, prepared with a spirit of invention and a
respect for fresh local ingredients, to be among the finest we've
had anywhere.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the fish menu alone, we sampled baked fresh sardines with
cornmeal crust, tiny oysters served with sea bass carpaccio, a
whole giant prawn, sea bream baked in salt, a delicate fish soup
with vegetables, and baked squid. Then there were two risottos,
served in scooped-out ewes-milk cheeses from the island of Pag;
turkey breast with a sauce of wild berries and sour cherries; and,
of course, truffles, with roasted potatoes and beef carpaccio. The
more expensive of the meals came to less than $70 for both of us,
including first-rate Istrian wines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The food was fine at less exalted restaurants just a few hundred
feet from our harborside hotel, the Sol Inn Adriatic, which only
strengthened our impression of Rovinj as an ideal place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being very picturesque, at least in the old-town section
that juts out into the sea, Rovinj has a comfortable way of
balancing its own day-to-day life with the needs of visitors.
Stores are open late. Everyone speaks Italian, and to judge by our
experience, German and English as well. Rovinj also seems
particularly child-friendly _ it has an aquarium and boat trips to
nearby islands.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Sol Inn, the sunny charm of the stucco exterior
didn't quite prepare us for the utilitarian renovation of the
interior, and the lack of an elevator might be a problem for guests
on the third and fourth floors. But we would happily stay there
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the old town, Rovinj, like some other parts of Istria,
is growing. Big two-story houses are going up. There are real
estate ads on the Internet with prices in dollars and marks, a
trend likely to accelerate under the political loosening that
followed the death of President Tudjman last December. ``Luxury''
hotels from the Tito era of industrial tourism are being upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's a feeling in the air that Istria is about to
be invaded for the umpteenth time in 3,000 years _ this time, with
any luck, by the kind of people who just want to unwind with a few
drinks, a few laughs or a few truffles.

   Lots of information on lodging, restaurants, festivals and
landmarks is available at www.istra.com (Istra is the native
spelling of Istria). Searching can be confined to a particular town
by adding a slash and the name of the town, as in
www.istra.com/rovinj. These pages link to forms for making hotel
reservations, but be sure to get a confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Croatian National Tourist Office at 350 Fifth Ave.,
New York, N.Y 10118; (800) 829-4416, fax (212) 279-8683.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>
   Most sizable towns in Istria are reachable by public bus, but
the practical choice for any short-term visitor is a car. If
renting a car in another country, make sure the rental agency gives
you a verifying document including the agency's phone number since
the authorities sometimes stop drivers, looking for stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay and Eat
</P>
<P>
   Rovinj has a sterile-looking luxury hotel, the Melia Eden, on
Luja Adamovica, (385-52) 800-400, fax (385-52) 811-349. Rates,
including breakfast and dinner, range from $52 to $63 a person in
July and August, at the exchange rate of 8.5 kuna to the dollar. In
spring and fall, rates fall to about $40 a person, and the hotel
closes in February and much of November.
</P>
<P>
   We preferred the more picturesque location of the less expensive
Sol Inn Adriatic, Piazza Maresciallo Tito 5, Rovinj, (385-52)
815-088, fax (385-52) 813-573, right on the harbor in the old town.
We got a big room with a sea view and a private bath for around $40
a night, sumptuous buffet breakfast included; in summer, a double,
with breakfast, is about $70. The hotel is closed from early
January to Easter.
</P>
<P>
   There are several hearty restaurants (fish, pasta, lamb) a short
walk from the Adriatic. We sampled Amfora and the funkier Veli
Joze, which makes fine stews, and paid less than $30 for two,
including wine or beer.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably no compelling reason to stay overnight in Pula,
but you could do worse than the Hotel Riviera, a properly
impressive Old World place a few blocks from the Roman amphitheater
at Splitska Ulika 1, (385-52) 211-166, fax (385-52) 219-117.
Doubles cost $35 to $56, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   On a more intimate scale, in the neighboring suburb of Pjescana
Uvala, Valsabbion (which houses a superb restaurant of the same
name) is a sunny inn with several contemporary Mediterranean-style
rooms, spa services, a fitness center and a small rooftop pool at
Pjescana Uvala IX/26, telephone and fax (385-52) 218-033;
www.valsabbion.com. Depending on the season, doubles range from $36
to $106.
</P>
<P>
   Things to Do
</P>
<P>
   In Pula, the Roman amphitheater, on Falvjeska Ulica, (385-52)
219-028, is open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. in summer, to 4:30 in the
off-season; admission, about $2, $1 for children and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby pedestrian street, Ulica Sergijevaca, is a trail of
history, including the Triumphal Arch of Sergius and the Temple of
Augustus.
</P>
<P>
   Also close by, on Ulica Carrarina, is the Archeological Museum,
(385-52) 218-603, fax (385-52) 212-415, which has artifacts from
all over Istria. It is open 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday to Friday (till
8 p.m. in summer) and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. Admission is
$1.40 and 70 cents for children and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   In Rovinj, the baroque Cathedral of St. Euphemia, has a
commanding view of the town and, inside, the sarcophagus of St.
Euphemia, which according to legend disappeared from Constantinople
around 800 and miraculously washed up on the Rovinj coast.

  Hotel offers rooms with a view and good books to read 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use with Catalina package) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON _ Most of Catalina Island's tourist lodgings are
clustered near Avalon's town center, which patrons might find to be
both a convenience and a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk from the boat dock to the small hotels that hug
Crescent Avenue, but your room is likely to be right on top of the
perpetual, late-night bash that is Avalon's pedestrian plaza.
</P>
<P>
   An establishment slightly inland can provide different
drawbacks. On a recent visit, I sampled the Hotel St. Lauren, a
big, pink, Victorian wedding cake of a hotel at the corner of
Metropole Avenue and Beacon Street. It was comfortable enough, but
Catalina, in favoring electric golf carts over internal-combustion
vehicles, has swapped one form of pollution for another.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean-view room on the second floor here was like having a
box at the Golf Cart 500. The carts continually scream up and down
the hills, all day and late into the night, their overtaxed motors
sounding like electric shavers during a power surge.
</P>
<P>
   For peace and quiet on Catalina _ without having to pay the
steep rates of the incomparable Inn on Mount Ada _ the best option
might be the Zane Grey Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   It perches on a hill above the island's Casino, at the west edge
of Avalon Bay. And Chimes Tower Road, which snakes past its front
door, gets only infrequent traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo's greatest attributes are its location _ the views
are terrific _ and its distinction as the former home of Grey, a
prolific writer of Western novels in the 1910s, '20s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   At that, this place might not be for everyone. It's rustic, with
simple, basic furnishings. It feels old, it smells old ... it is
old _ built at the author's bidding in 1926. Because it was later
converted from home to hotel, most of the guest rooms had to be
retrofitted with bathrooms, and in many cases it was a tight
squeeze. A 5-foot-11 patron is likely to find, for example, a
shower stall that is exactly 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms have neither phones nor TVs. Instead, guests who want
to catch a particular show gather by the fireplace in the living
room _ and hope no one has chosen that particular moment to play
the Pueblo's grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat visitors to the Pueblo roll with these quirks, and
perhaps like the place all the more for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's an old building, there are some things we can't
change,'' said general manager Michael Shehabi. ``But everything is
functional, everything works. Sometimes people hear 'rustic' and
they're not sure what they're going to get. We make sure it's super
clean, but the rusticness stays _ we're not going to modernize it
at all. A lot of the guests tell me they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo has 16 guest rooms, seven of which have full ocean
views. Four of the nine canyon-view rooms have private balconies.
It also has something that's hard to come by in Catalina: a pool.
In deference to Grey's legacy, this one is in the shape of an
arrowhead.
</P>
<P>
   Three different sitting areas at the Pueblo provide excellent
views _ two of the bay, one of the scrub-covered hills to the west.
Those views come with a price, in that it's a steep climb from the
town center to here. It can be invigorating on a cool evening, but
if you're not up to it, complimentary taxi service is provided at
scheduled times during the day. (The taxi ride from the boat dock
to the hotel is also complimentary.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the Pueblo's nice touches is that each of the rooms is
named after one of Grey's novels. He produced more than 60 of them,
cranking them out at the rate of about one per month, and wrote
many of them at his home in Altadena or here. Most of the yarns are
moral tales featuring a loner protagonist with a mysterious past
who fights to uphold virtue and protect the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you stay in a room named for his most popular works
_ ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' (1912) or ``The Vanishing
American'' (1925) _ but you'll find a complete set of them in a
bookshelf in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can find the book that corresponds to your room. Then,
on a still Catalina night, in a room high above the hum of Avalon,
you can settle in with one of these books, and be transported into
Grey's world by words like these: ``There, beside his horse, stood
Lassiter, his dark apparel and the great black gun-sheaths
contrasting singularly with his gentle smile ...'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates at the Zane Grey Pueblo range from $135 to $165 in high
season (June through September). Until June 1, rates range from $80
to $110 on midweek nights, $135 to $165 on weekends. For
information or reservations, call (800) 378-3256 or (310) 510-0966.
The Pueblo's Web site is difficult to find and fairly unsatisfying
when you finally get there (it doesn't show pictures of individual
rooms, for example, as most lodging Web sites do). Go to
www.virtualcities.com, then click on ``Bed &AMP; Breakfast'' under
First Traveler's Choice. Then click on ``California,'' and scroll
down to ``Islands Off the Coast'' to find the Zane Grey Pueblo
entry. &QL;

CYBERSEX LEADS TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times) 
 &HT;     By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex is the hottest topic among adult users of the Internet, with
studies showing fully a third of all visits directed to sexually
oriented Web sites, chat rooms and news groups.
</P>
<P>
   For most people these forays into cybersex are relatively
harmless pursuits, but experts in the field say that the
affordability, accessibility and anonymity of the Internet are
fueling a brand new psychological disorder _ cybersex addiction _
that appears to be spreading with astonishing rapidity and bringing
turmoil to the lives of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers writing in the current issue of the journal Sexual
Addiction and Compulsivity report that many of the men and women
who now spend dozens of hours each week seeking sexual stimulation
from their computers deny that they have a problem and refuse to
seek help until their marriages, their jobs, or both, are in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the route to compulsive use of the Internet for
sexual satisfaction is fast and short, said Dr. Mark Schwartz of
the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis. ``Sex on the Net is
like heroin,'' he said. ``It grabs them and takes over their lives.
And it's very difficult to treat because the people affected don't
want to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most strongly hooked on Internet sex are likely to spend
hours each day masturbating to pornographic images or having
``mutual'' online sex with someone contacted through a chat room.
Occasionally, they progress to off-line affairs with sex partners
they meet online.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Al Cooper, a counseling coordinator at Stanford who has
conducted the largest and most detailed survey of online sex, calls
the Net ``the crack cocaine of sexual compulsivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted online among 9,265 men and women who
admitted surfing the Net for sexually oriented sites, indicated
that at least 1 percent were already seriously hooked on online
sex. The survey found that as many as a third of Internet users
visited some type of sexual site.
</P>
<P>
   Projected to the country as a whole, this would mean that a
minimum of 200,000 men and women have become cybersex addicts in
the last few years, Cooper said. And, he added, because the
respondents were self-selected and because denial of the symptoms
of sexual compulsivity is commonplace, there are likely to be many
more cybersex addicts than the survey indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hidden public health hazard exploding, in part,
because very few are recognizing it as such or taking it
seriously,'' Cooper wrote in his Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity
report.
</P>
<P>
   Another author, Dr. Jennifer Schneider, a physician in Tucson,
Ariz., who is associate editor of the journal, said in an interview
that even when cybersex addicts and their partners sought
treatment, they often concealed their real problem, and therapists
often failed to ask questions that would disclose it. As a result,
the diagnosis of cybersex addiction is often missed, Dr. Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kimberly S. Young of the Center for Online Addiction in
Bradford, Pa., wrote that ``partially as a result of the general
population and health care professionals not being attuned to the
risks, seemingly harmless cyberromps can result in serious
difficulties way beyond what was expected or intended.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cooper, who works at the San Jose Marital and
Sexuality Center in Santa Clara, Calif., cybersex compulsives are
just like drug addicts; they ``use the Internet as an important
part of their sexual acting out, much like a drug addict who has a
`drug of choice,''' and often with serious harm to their home lives
and livelihood. Especially vulnerable to becoming hooked on
Internet sex, he wrote, are ``those users whose sexuality may have
been suppressed and limited all their lives [who) suddenly find an
infinite supply of sexual opportunities'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dana Putnam, a psychologist in San Luis Obispo, Calif., said
other factors that could increase a person's vulnerability to
cybersex compulsion were depression and other forms of emotional
distress, relationship problems and a failure to get one's sexual
needs met.
</P>
<P>
   However, a second survey conducted by Schneider among 94 family
members affected by cybersex addiction revealed that the problem
could arise even among those in loving marriages with ample sexual
opportunities. ``Sex on the Net is just so seductive and it's so
easy to stumble upon it,'' she said. ``People who are vulnerable
can get hooked before they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who say a behavioral compulsion is not a true
addiction, Schneider responded with a definition of addiction that
would clearly apply to cybersex abusers: ``Loss of control,
continuation of the behavior despite significant adverse
consequences and preoccupation or obsession with obtaining the drug
or pursuing the behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Although behavioral addictions involve no external drugs,
preliminary research has suggested that they cause changes in brain
chemicals, like the release of endorphins, that help to perpetuate
the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual stimulation and release obtained through cybersex
also contribute importantly to the continued pursuit of the
activity, Schwartz said. He wrote: ``Intense orgasms from the
minimal investment of a few keystrokes are powerfully
reinforcing.'' He added, ``Cybersex affords easy, inexpensive
access to a myriad of ritualized encounters with idealized
partners. Many cybersex abusers are re-enacting aspects of past
losses, conflicts or traumas in order to foster illusions of power
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cybersex addicts develop a conditioned response to the
computer and become sexually aroused even before turning it on,
Putnam said. This can exacerbate the problem for people whose jobs
involve work on a computer. ``Simply sitting down to work at the
computer can start a sexual response that may facilitate online
sexual activities,'' he wrote in the journal.
</P>
<P>
   As with other addictions, tolerance to cybersex stimulation can
develop, prompting the addict to take more and more risks to
recapture the initial high, Schneider said. Online viewing that
began as a harmless recreation can become an all-consuming activity
and even lead to real sexual encounters with people met online.
</P>
<P>
   Cybersex compulsives can become so involved with their online
activities that they ignore their partners and children and risk
their jobs. In Cooper's survey, 20 percent of the men and 12
percent of the women reported they had used computers at work for
some sexual pursuits. Many companies now monitor employees' online
activities, and repeated visits to sexually oriented sites have
cost people their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including two physicians, have landed in federal
prison for two years because they downloaded child pornography when
authorities were watching, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, most who pursue cybersex consider it harmless and safe to
do so. While social and safety concerns and fear of discovery may
prevent someone from visiting an adult bookstore or prostitute,
there are no such constraints when pornography and sexual partners
can be called up at any time of the day or night on a computer
screen in one's home or office, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say ``What's the harm? They're not risking disease
or death,'' Schneider, who has written extensively on sexual
addiction, responds that the damage can be as devastating as that
caused by compulsive gambling or addiction to alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In her survey, 91 women and 3 men in committed relationships
said they had experienced serious adverse consequences, including
broken relationships, from their partners' cybersex addictions.
Partners commonly reported feeling betrayed, devalued, deceived,
ignored and abandoned and unable to compete with a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a 34-year-old woman married 14 years to a
minister who she discovered was compulsively seeking sexual
satisfaction by visiting pornographic sites on the Internet. ``How
can I compete with hundreds of anonymous others who are now in our
bed, in his head?'' the woman wrote. ``Our bed is crowded with
countless faceless strangers, where once we were intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   A 38-year-old woman married 18 years to a man who compulsively
masturbates to images on the computer wrote that her husband had
once had an extramarital affair and that ``the online `safe'
cheating has just as dirty, filthy a feel to it as does the
`real-life' cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cooper's survey indicates that most female cybersex
addicts are single, married women also become cybersex addicts and
their husbands suffer the consequences. A 44-year-old man married
26 years to a woman who became hooked on cybersex wrote: ``At first
we had sex more than ever as I desperately tried to prove myself.
Then sex with her made me sick. I get strong pictures of what she
did and lusted after, and I get repelled and feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who become cybersex addicts may face even greater risks
than their male counterparts. Women, who tend to pursue
relationships, are inclined to visit sexually oriented chat rooms
rather than the pornographic Web sites that men prefer, Cooper
said. As women become increasingly hooked on online sex, they are
more likely to progress to off-line meetings, which can prove
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Children, too, often become victimized by cybersex addiction in
a parent. As Schneider noted, children can stumble upon the
pornographic material left on or near the computer or walk in on a
parent masturbating at the computer. Several mothers in her survey
were worried because their husbands surfed the Net while supposedly
watching their children, who got to view the pornography and
sometimes the masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   Children may also suffer as a result of increasing conflict
between the parents or breakup of the marriage. Even if the
marriage survives, children may lack adequate parental attention
when one parent is preoccupied with sex on the computer and the
other is preoccupied with the cybersex addict.
</P>
<P>
   Once unleashed, the power of a cyberaffair, cybersex, or both,
can cause a formerly loving man to become evasive and to demand his
privacy online, according to Young and her co-authors. ``This `new
frontier' in relationship dynamics can lead a once warm and
compassionate wife and mother to turn to the computer and its
cyberworld lovers and/or sex partners and away from caring for her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   As Putnam put it, ``Once people get hooked on cybersex, they
tend to put themselves at risk and do things they wouldn't
ordinarily do.''

BALAGUER, 93, STILL A KEY AS DOMINICANS VOTE FOR PRESIDENT  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO _ He's blind, hard of hearing and barely able to
walk, but Joaquin Balaguer, at 93, is running again for president
of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   And to no one's surprise here, the enigmatic strongman, perhaps
Latin America's longest-surviving politician, is putting up another
tough fight, for his eighth presidential term since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Although Balaguer is not expected to win election, most analysts
predict his conservative Reformist Social Christian Party will
place second or a close third, leaving him in the familiar position
of influencing this country's future.
</P>
<P>
   Many Dominicans are amazed _ and some are disgusted _ at the
seemingly endless presence of Balaguer, ruler for 22 of the past 34
years, in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible that in the year 2000, we're still talking
about Balaguer for president,'' said Daniel Castillo, a 22-year-old
newspaper vendor in the capital. ``It's like we're frozen in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When millions of voters cast their ballots in this Caribbean
country where presidential politics is hotter than baseball,
Hipolito Mejia, a 59-year-old agricultural economist, probably will
take first place. His social democratic Dominican Revolutionary
Party has held a solid lead in public opinion polls for months,
hovering between 40 and 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether Mejia will receive enough support
for an outright victory _ 50 percent plus one vote _ or will be
forced into a runoff on June 30 against Balaguer or Danilo Medina,
candidate of the ruling centrist Dominican Liberation Party.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the election appears more focused on second place,
and on whether Balaguer, once a close aide to the late dictator
Rafael Trujillo, will have his shot at another term in the National
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreigners have wondered how Balaguer can maintain the
respect of his people after making openly racist and hostile
remarks about Haitians as well as other people of African descent,
who make up a majority of the country's 8 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   His fans, however, say they admire the score of books he has
written and his drive to build the nation's highways and its
countless political monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Most people thought Balaguer's political career, which began
when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House, was finally over
when he reluctantly left office in 1996 and threw his support in a
special election to Leonel Fernandez, the centrist party candidate
who is the current president. By law, incumbent presidents cannot
run for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   A string of squabbles between Balaguer's party and the Fernandez
government, the rise of Mejia's campaign and the lack of a strong
candidate for his own party brought Balaguer out of seclusion and
back into the limelight. When he announced his candidacy in
January, six months after his opponents had launched theirs,
Balaguer said he was doing it ``out of necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't want to run,'' said George Rodriguez, a
former television executive who is now Balaguer's campaign
spokesman. ``It's obviously a sacrifice for him, especially at his
age and in his condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and diplomats, however, say Balaguer's candidacy is
more about control than sacrifice, and they worry that his election
could lead to a reversal of some of the policies that have
succeeded in igniting Latin America's fastest-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really work with Balaguer,'' one diplomat said last
week. ``It's him or his ring of people who try to run everything.
He doesn't understand why some things shouldn't be run by the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that of front-runner Mejia, Balaguer's campaign platform
has emphasized the country's growing inequality _ about 60 percent
of the population lives in extreme poverty _ and has promised a
more active government in everything from roads to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Balaguer's candidacy has relied more on his image and his
party's machine than on any political agenda. The candidate has
appeared only occasionally in public and he refuses media
interviews, relying instead on an aggressive publicity strategy and
a cadre of volunteers _ many of them youths _ to canvass
neighborhoods across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign-ending rally on Friday along the Malecon, the
capital's coastal drive, tens of thousands of supporters dressed in
red shirts waited hours in the afternoon heat to hear Balaguer,
who, after being gingerly lifted to his feet by aides, spoke for
less than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Balaguer's own rivals credit the former president for
leading the Dominican Republic out of turmoil after the 30-year
Trujillo dictatorship ended in 1960, they say the country will not
be truly democratic until Balaguer is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done much for this country and he's given out lots of
favors to people, but it's time for us to move forward,'' said Jose
Tomas Perez, secretary general of the governing party, as he
addressed a group of Dominicans who flew home from the United
States to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, 47, the centrist economist who served as Fernandez's
chief of staff until he resigned last year to run for president,
has relied heavily on the government's record of promoting
privatization projects, tourism and high-tech manufacturing jobs
that has produced 7 percent economic growth and significantly lower
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Medina's candidacy has been hampered by his low-key
personality and fights within his party. As a consequence, many
observers predict that Balaguer would do better in a runoff against
Mejia than Medina would.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, meanwhile, has run on pledges of ethical cleanliness,
taking jabs at corruption scandals that have rocked the Fernandez
administration. Mejia's supporters last week insisted they had
enough support for an outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in anticipation of a poor showing, the ruling party has
accused the country's main electoral council and opposition parties
of creating confusion among residents by reassigning more than
300,000 voters to new balloting precincts. And there are rumors _
always present in a campaign involving Balaguer _ of plans to
meddle with the ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls show Balaguer and Medina in a statistical tie
for second place. Should the elder rival, known for his dark suits
and black hat, place third, his endorsement will be key to deciding
the country's next president. Once again, Balaguer would play
kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Joaquin Balaguer, this has been one of the nicest
campaigns,'' political columnist Jose P. Monegro wrote in the Santo
Domingo daily Listin. ``There's little he's had to do and he hasn't
received a single direct attack. The conditions have been set so
that this ancient ``caudillo'' _ boss _ can pass into history as
the politician to imitate.''

LOS ALAMOS BECOMES A LAPTOP LAB
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
  By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Throughout the 11-day-old fire that has swept
through the pine forests around Los Alamos National Laboratory in
northern New Mexico, the lab's computer system has remained up and
running _ providing an eerie but comforting virtual presence for
scientists exiled from their research. Every day they have been
able to sign on to the system to exchange e-mail messages, download
unclassified files for work and reassure themselves that the lab is
still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sign that things are OK,'' said Dr. Luis
Bettencourt, a physicist who, displaced from his office, has been
working from his home in Santa Fe. ``I just hope the fire doesn't
get worse over there in the next few days _ the winds are picking
up,'' he said. Bettencourt said he worried about losing some files
because he could not download everything. ``But that is really
nothing compared to the people who have lost their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Little can be more wrenching than evacuating one's neighborhood
not knowing if it will remain. Many of the scientists who have been
forced by the Cerro Grande fire to flee Los Alamos face being
refugees from their second homes: the laboratories and offices
where they study cosmology, particle physics, immunology and other
areas of research unrelated to weapons design.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Wojciech H. Zurek, an expert on quantum mechanics,
evacuated his home, one of the first things he grabbed was his
Powerbook. ``Over the last couple of years, I've ended up relying
more and more on it and less on the laboratory computer system,
which has become so secure that it is harder and harder to access
files remotely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One graduate student, afraid for his data, rushed to his office
shortly after the fire began and, ignoring rules requiring a
property removal form, grabbed his computer and took it home. ``He
just took the law into his own hands,'' said his supervisor, Dr.
Catherine Macken, a theoretical biologist. ``He said, `I need my
computer; my life's work is on it.''' She said that under the
circumstances she was sure there would be no disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less successful as they tried to rescue data. ``I
was and still am anxious about data, books, papers, etc. _
essentially my scientific heritage for the last 25 years,'' said
Dr. Alan Perelson, a Los Alamos scientist who uses computer
simulations of the immune system to study the AIDS virus. Perelson,
who also has an office at the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit,
multidisciplinary research and education center, said he spent an
afternoon downloading information off the Los Alamos computers.
Because of security reasons, however, he could not access all the
files.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the least of his worries. ``What is most difficult
is trying to find out where people are,'' Perelson said. ``Work has
almost ground to a standstill, not only because of lack of access
to labs and computers, but because we are all concerned with the
news and our friends and neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Santa Fe scientists, Perelson has been housing
displaced colleagues. ``I am currently housing two full families
plus one lab visitor (10 people in all) as well as pets (three
cats, one dog); so things are chaotic and communal at my house,''
he wrote in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Just as people have opened their homes to friends, so has the
Santa Fe Institute opened its computers, providing a kind of
laboratory in exile for scientists who feel they must work even in
such distressing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had said early on that anybody who wants to show up should
feel free to do so,'' said Dr. Erica Jen, a research professor at
the institute. A conference room has been turned into a computer
lab. Other Los Alamos scientists _ 10 to 15 were expected Monday _
are using some of the empty desks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stirling Colgate came in over the weekend, talking himself
past a security guard ``by saying, `I'm a physicist from Los
Alamos,' and making it sound convincing.'' Today he was
transferring some files from Los Alamos and preparing to meet with
a postdoctoral student from Pakistan about an astrophysics project.
``This is my lifeline to continue my work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many theorists, their laboratories are as portable as their
laptops. Dr. Christian Forst, a biologist at the lab who uses
computer models to study microbial genomes, said: ``I have an
advantage compared to all the experimenters I collaborate with.
They can just sit and read some papers but I can at least do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Frauenfelder, director of Los Alamos' Center for
Nonlinear Studies, was worried that he would have to cancel his
division's 20th annual conference early next month. Gathering at
his home in Santa Fe Monday, he and some colleagues decided that,
one way or the other, the conference would go on.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another reason for the meeting, Frauenfelder said:
``People should feel that life is continuing and that we really
care.''

VICTIMS OF GENDER-MOTIVATED CRIMES CANNOT SUE ATTACKERS, COURT
SAYS

(Eds: Note reference to text of decision on Times' Web site at end
of 5th graf, The law's ...) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that ``the Constitution requires a
distinction between what is truly national and what is truly
local,'' the Supreme Court on Monday invalidated a 6-year-old
provision of a law that permitted victims of rape, domestic
violence and other crimes ``motivated by gender'' to sue their
attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision striking down the civil remedy provision of the
Violence Against Women Act was the latest application of the
court's newly restrictive view of congressional power and of the
degree of deference that Congress is owed by federal courts. While
it was one of the most sweeping of the court's recent decisions in
this area, it almost certainly will not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion rejected
each of the two sources of constitutional authority that Congress
had asserted as the basis for the legislation, concluding that the
law was neither a valid regulation of interstate commerce nor a
proper means of enforcing the equal protection guarantee of the
14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affirmed a ruling last year by the federal appeals
court in Richmond, Va., dismissing a suit brought by a college
student against two varsity football players whom she had accused
of raping her in her dormitory room shortly after the start of her
freshman year. The plaintiff, Christy Brzonkala, withdrew from
Virginia Polytechnic Institute after learning that the football
players, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, would not be
disciplined by the college. When the defendants challenged the
constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, the federal
government intervened in the suit to defend the law.
</P>
<P>
   The law's supporters argued that widespread violence against
women, and fear of violence, has a negative effect on the nation's
economy, measured in the billions of dollars a year, by impairing
the productivity and mobility of female employees and students. To
accept that reasoning, the chief justice said, ``would allow
Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide,
aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on
employment, production, transit, or consumption.'' But a general
police power was something ``which the Founders denied the national
government and reposed in the states,'' he added. (Text of the
decision is available from The New York Times on the Web,
www.nytimes.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Against Women Act also has a criminal provision,
making it a federal crime to cross state lines to commit an act of
domestic violence or stalking, which was not at issue in the case
Monday. The Supreme Court last year refused to hear a challenge to
that provision, which the chief justice suggested in a footnote
Monday was constitutional because of the explicit requirement of
interstate conduct. The law also provides federal money to the
states for programs in preventing violence and assisting victims.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attention and debate surrounding the law has focused
on the civil damages provision at issue Monday, which the lower
courts have applied some 50 times, a number that would probably
have been larger had the law not been under a constitutional cloud.
While most states have laws permitting people, including victims of
sexual assaults, to seek damages against their attackers, Congress
acted after dozens of studies showed that women seeking such relief
faced considerable obstacles from state judicial systems that
regarded sex offenses as unworthy of serious attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the chief Senate sponsor of the
Violence Against Women Act, said at a news conference Monday that
``this decision is really all about power: who has the power, the
court or Congress?''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said there had been notable improvement in the states
since Congress put the issue on its agenda in the early 1990s. He
predicted that Monday's decision would have ``a lot less impact on
violence against women than on the future role of the United States
Congress,'' adding: ``The damage done to the act is not as bad as
the damage done to American jurisprudence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Biden and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the law's chief
sponsor when he represented Brooklyn in the House of
Representatives, said that years of hearings before the law was
passed were aimed at compiling a record of the scope of the problem
to persuade the Supreme Court that a national solution was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just at a time when the economic and social conditions of the
world demand that we be treated as one country and not as 50
states, the Supreme Court seems poised to undue decades and decades
of a consensus that the federal government has an active role to
play,'' Schumer said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion Monday, Justice David H. Souter included
three pages of findings from various congressional reports and
predicted that the majority's ``new judicially derived federalism''
would eventually prove as serious a wrong turn for the court as the
decisions of the 1930s rejecting elements of the New Deal, which
provoked the court-packing crisis of 1937. Referring to that
episode's ``pedigree of near-tragedy,'' Souter said that ``today's
decision can only be seen as a step toward recapturing the prior
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices' 5-4 division Monday was familiar from a series of
decisions over the past five years that have struck down federal
laws or created new state immunities from the application of
federal law. The first such ruling was U.S. vs. Lopez in 1995,
which overturned a law against carrying a gun near a school and
marked the first time since the New Deal that the court had
invalidated a law as exceeding Congress' power to regulate
interstate commerce. The court has also struck down part of the
Brady gun control law and laws making states liable in federal
court for patent and trademark violations. Earlier this year, the
court ruled that states could not be sued by their employees for
violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist in the majority Monday, as in all the other
decisions, were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Thomas wrote a brief
concurring opinion to say that the court should have put Congress
under an even tighter rein. Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote a
dissenting opinion Monday and also signed Souter's dissent, as did
Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the tone of the opinions Monday, totaling 71 pages, was
quite muted, the gulf between the two factions of the court is wide
and growing wider. The court has already granted review in three
more federalism cases and the decision Monday, U.S. vs. Morrison,
No. 99-5, is likely to inspire more challenges to Congress'
reliance on its authority to regulate interstate commerce. Federal
environmental regulations that restrict the use of private property
may present an inviting target for such a challenge, some students
of these recent developments believe.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion Monday reiterated that the
``economic nature of the regulated activity'' was at the heart of
any analysis of Congress' exercise of its commerce authority.
``Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the
phrase, economic activity,'' he said. The opinion stopped short of
adopting a categorical rule that Congress can never do what it
claimed to do in this law: address the aggregate economic effect of
activity that itself may not be inherently economic. But the chief
justice noted pointedly that the court had never endorsed such an
approach. In any event, he said, the court was and would remain
``the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Souter said that when it came to
``supposed conflicts of sovereign political interests implicated by
the Commerce Clause,'' the court should step back and let the
political system work out the problem. Noting that 36 states had
filed briefs supporting the law, he said it was ``not the least
irony'' of the case that ``the states will be forced to enjoy the
new federalism whether they want it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the provision could not be sustained under the
14th Amendment because that amendment prohibits discrimination by
states or ``state actors'' rather than the private individuals
whose conduct is the target of this law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn J. Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense
and Education Fund, which represented Brzonkala, criticized the
decision Monday for ``taking the federal government out of the
business of defining civil rights and creating remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Rosman, general counsel of the Center for Individual
Rights, which challenged the law on behalf of the defendants, said
the decision was a welcome reminder that ``democratic majorities
are limited by the text of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an effort by Congress to aggrandize its authority,''
he added, ``and the court is now requiring Congress to toe the
constitutional line.''

SUPER SEEDS SWEEPING MAJOR MARKETS, AND BRAZIL MAY BE NEXT

<TEXT>
<P>
   He was dazzled by the vast fields of soybeans in Brazil, and the
efficiency of the farms in Argentina frankly frightened him. But
nothing that Harold H. Dyer, an Iowa farmer, saw on his working
vacation in South America last year surprised him more than finding
out that his competitors freely used genetically modified soybeans
in ways that would have landed him in a heap of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He knew most farmers in Argentina planted modified soybean
seeds, but he did not know they saved seeds from one year to plant
the next, a practice that is legal in Argentina but not in North
America. The Argentinians told him they never pay a technology fee
for the seeds, which cost American farmers an extra $6.50 a bag.
</P>
<P>
   And in Brazil, where such seeds are still outlawed, no one came
right out and said so, but Dyer was convinced that the seeds were
being smuggled in. The Brazilian government insists that no
genetically altered soybeans are grown there, but Dyer said he saw
soybean fields that were as free of weeds as the parts of his own
2,500-acre farm in Iowa and Missouri where he sows the super seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to live by their rules, of which there aren't any,
and we have to live by ours, which are numerous,'' said Dyer, 75,
who also runs several grain elevators in Iowa and Missouri. ``It's
not fair, and I would like for it to be changed, but that's the way
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is in the process of deciding whether to make the new
technology legal. And there is a growing sense that what happens in
Brazil _ the world's No. 2 soybean producer, after the United
States _ could tip the balance on genetically altered crops around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brazil officially reject biotechnology's lure, it would
be a big setback for American companies that have already been hurt
financially by fierce resistance in Europe from consumers and large
companies that refuse to buy modified produce. But if Brazil's huge
agricultural sector joins the biotech fold, experts say, it may
someday be difficult for consumers anywhere to find any food free
of genetically modified material.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the United States, Brazil and Argentina, the No.
3 producer, together grow 80 percent of the world's 157 million
metric tons of soybeans, an extraordinarily versatile crop that is
pressed into oil, processed into food, and added to countless
foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Brazil starts harvesting transgenic soybeans, there will
be no turning back,'' said Joao Carlos Carvalho, president of
Agropecuaria Basso, a Brazilian company licensed to sell the seeds
if they are approved.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Brazil also shows how difficult it is to
control this new technology in the absence of any global regulatory
mechanism. The Brazilian government approved the use of modified
seeds developed by Monsanto in 1998, but a consumer group
challenged the approval in federal court in Brazil. Delmiro Silva,
a spokesman for Monsanto in Brazil, expects a ruling sometime this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it is still illegal to plant high-tech seeds in
Brazil. This is such a sensitive issue that the minister of
agriculture, Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, would respond only
to a written question. ``The commercial planting of genetically
modified soybeans in Brazil is not permitted,'' he wrote. Frequent
government testing, he added, has confirmed that the harvest is
free of genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many agricultural experts, Brazilian and American alike,
suspect that modified seeds are being smuggled in from Argentina.
Dwain L. Ford, chairman for international affairs at the American
Soybean Association, estimated that up to 30 percent of Brazil's
soy crop could already be genetically modified. South American
farmers are thus using the new technology without paying for it or
necessarily understanding how to control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no strict controls on highways or in warehouses, so
no one really knows how many seeds have been smuggled in,'' said
David Brew, a partner at Brasoja Corretora de Cereais, a grain
trading company in Porto Alegre, Brazil. ``Now the concern is that
the smuggling has resulted in the trafficking of second-generation
seeds as well.''
</P>
<P>
   While suspicious consumers stopped such farming in its tracks in
Europe, the rush to biotech on this side of the Atlantic appears to
be picking up steam. The big biotech companies, led by Monsanto,
have made the Western hemisphere a vast proving ground for farmer
acceptance of the seeds, government regulation of the crops and the
limits to which intellectual property rights can be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' progress has been formidable. In 1996, altered
crops were planted on little more than 4 million acres worldwide.
Today, altered soy, corn, cotton, canola and other crops are grown
on nearly 100 million acres, 99 percent of it in just three
countries: the United States, Argentina and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although American consumers generally have been less upset than
Europeans by the new crops, the Clinton administration plans to
tighten regulations on the development and marketing of genetically
modified plants and foods.
</P>
<P>
   The reason farmers in many countries, even a few in Spain,
France and Portugal, embrace the new technology despite consumer
fears is simple: lower costs. With declining prices and an
oversupply of soy, farmers look for every advantage.

<P>
   By altering the seeds, Monsanto enables plants to withstand the
widely used weed killer Roundup, which Monsanto also manufactures.
Farmers who use Roundup Ready seed save on chemicals and labor
because they can apply a single herbicide without harming the soy
plants.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Auburn University has found that farmers who use the
seeds can cut costs 4 percent, reduce the need for pesticides, and
save time as well. For someone like Dyer, this is incentive enough
to switch entirely this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he will have to live by several conditions imposed by
Monsanto, at least in North America. Farmers must pay a fee for
each bag of seed. They must agree not to save seed for the
following year, a practice farmers have used for years. And they
must agree that if they ever stop using the seed, Monsanto
investigators _ farmers call them ``gene police'' _ can walk their
fields to take plant samples.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has fought hard to define its intellectual property
rights broadly, and to defend them vigorously. Thousands of calls
have come in to its informers' hot line about farmers who planted
saved seed. Monsanto has brought charges against ``a fraction of a
fraction'' of the roughly 250,000 farmers who have ever used
Roundup Ready seed, a spokesman said, declining to be more
specific. Nearly all quietly pay their fines.
</P>
<P>
   But in Saskatchewan, Monsanto is bringing a farmer to court for
illegally growing genetically altered canola. The farmer, Percy
Schmeiser, acknowledged that Monsanto investigators found altered
plants on his land, but he insisted that he did not plant them.
They were grown, he said, from seed that had blown off passing
grain trucks or drifted in on the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had anything to do with Monsanto,'' Schmeiser said.
``They were simply trying to see how far they could exercise
property rights over farmers, even those who hadn't planted their
seed.''
</P>
<P>
   When he refused to pay the fines, Schmeiser was brought to court
by Monsanto. The case, scheduled to be heard before summer, is
widely seen as a test of Monsanto's intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I lose my case,'' Schmeiser said, ``every farmer in North
America will become a serf.'' Monsanto declined to discuss the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In South America, Monsanto has been far less vigilant. In 1995,
its application for a patent on Roundup Ready seed in Argentina was
rejected. It appealed, but went ahead anyway with plans to
introduce the seed. Without a patent, Monsanto had no legal right
to charge a fee or inspect farms to see if unauthorized seed was
being planted.
</P>
<P>
   With no patent, a black market flourished, forcing Monsanto to
lower prices to less than half its American price.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as much as 90 percent of Argentina's soy crop may be
genetically altered, the highest percentage in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's decision to enter this market without patent
protection puzzled many people, including its fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends,
which is suing Monsanto in federal court for alleged antitrust
violations, said Monsanto had long argued that it could not make
money unless it controlled intellectual property rights. But its
decision to sell the seeds in Argentina anyway, he said, shows
``they don't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto says it will eventually have adequate patent protection
in Brazil. Executives insist that despite the experience in
Argentina, patent protection remains essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to deal with realities as well,'' said Robert L.
Harness, director of international government affairs at Monsanto.
``The consideration entering Argentina was that we wanted to obtain
patent protection. We also wanted to provide our new technology to
this market. We wish the situation were different, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, police have raided fields in the states of Rio Grande
do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul, where officials have said they
intend to declare their states free of modified seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction is clear. European customers have reportedly
already started asking for Brazilian soybeans because modified
seeds are illegal there.
</P>
<P>
   But segregating vast quantities of a commodity produced at
thousands of farms would be daunting even in the United States. The
ability of a developing country like Brazil to pull off such a task
is questioned, even by Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is someone going to sift through each truck of soybeans that
arrives at port for export?'' said Carvalho, president of
Agropecuaria Basso.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Thrane, a spokeswoman for Cargill, the large American
commodities company, said the company ``certainly wouldn't
represent soybean shipments from Brazil as being 100 percent
non-genetically enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion about the future is deeply divided in South America, as
elsewhere. While some see salvation in keeping the seeds out, many
farmers are eager to enjoy an edge in a tight global market.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we compete against the Americans and the Argentinians
if they're allowed access to this technology and we're not?'' said
Armando Carlos Roos, a soybean farmer in Rio Grande do Sul.
``Everyone knows transgenic soybeans have been smuggled in from
Argentina,'' he said, and the pressure to use the new technology,
legally or not, is intense. ``I will go broke if I don't get to use
transgenic beans. It's as simple as that.''

COMMENTARY: COMPLETE AND UTTER NONSENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a visit to Shanghai last year my New York Times colleague
Seth Faison and I interviewed the top managers of one of China's
largest food companies, which had been partially privatized. While
Seth interviewed the Chinese executives in Chinese, I leafed
through the company's annual report. On the first page there were
four pictures: the chairman, the vice chairman, the general manager
and ``the Communist Party representative'' to the company. At one
point I interrupted Seth's interview, pointed to the picture of the
Communist Party rep and asked our Chinese hosts: ``Say, what does
this guy do?'' They waved at the picture with disdain, as if to
say: ``He doesn't do anything. Just ignore him.''
</P>
<P>
   That encounter always stuck in my mind because it illustrated
one of the political implications of the rise of the private,
free-market economy in China. When managers and workers, students
and intellectuals are no longer totally dependent on the state or
the Communist Party for jobs, they are much more likely to speak
their own mind and act on their own interests. That is a fact worth
remembering as the U.S. Congress now debates whether to grant China
permanent normal trade relations with America.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the claims by some Clintonites or business types
that trade will lead inexorably to democracy in China are
exaggerated and too deterministic. But even more ridiculous is the
claim by John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, that ``there is no
information showing that China is improving its human rights
situation or workers rights situation,'' and thus no reason to
support permanent normalized trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   As any regular visitor to China can see (unfortunately the U.S.
unions have been discouraging members of Congress from visiting
China and seeing for themselves), there is ample evidence that the
strengthening of private enterprises and free markets in China, and
the surge in Internet usage there, is creating the space and
private incomes for more Chinese to live independent of the
government and thereby expand their personal freedoms. And the more
Chinese can live without the state, the more the democrats among
them can afford to speak their minds and the more other Chinese can
afford to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Read Elisabeth Rosenthal's May 8 front-page piece from Beijing
in this newspaper. It details the messy reality of today's China,
where the leadership, terrified about the political fallout from
China's joining the World Trade Organization, is cracking down _
and will continue to do so _ at the same time that Chinese liberals
are becoming more self-confident and willing to challenge the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the China of today,'' writes Rosenthal, a New York Times
Beijing reporter, ``threats from the central authorities have
diminished influence. Bookstores are still filled with provocative
books. And people fired from government institutes can now often
find a way to make a living in the expanding private sector ...
Even as Chinese intellectuals bemoan the current climate, they feel
more inconvenienced than terrified by the government's wrath. `The
methods are pretty much the same as in Deng Xiaoping's and even
Mao's time,' (a) professor said. `What's different is that nobody
pays attention anymore ... Intellectuals don't feel that much
pressure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal also notes that several recent devastating critiques
of China's rulers, and disclosures about corruption in the
Communist Party, have been circulated first on the Internet in
China, and the Chinese leadership has been powerless to stop it.
The China trade pact Congress is currently debating greatly
enhances the ability of U.S. companies to invest in Internet
development in China.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the AFL-CIO couldn't care less about political
change in China. That is just a cover for their head-in-the-sand
protectionism. China could become a democratic paradise tomorrow
and Sweeney and his union would still oppose this trade bill,
because they see it (wrongly) as just a vehicle to move U.S.
manufacturing jobs to China.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is free to argue that this bill will hurt U.S.
workers. Republican hard-liners are free to argue that China's
entry into the WTO will make it a more formidable geopolitical
rival to the United States. But for either of them to say that this
bill will hurt the cause of democratization in China, or that it
won't help create more islands from which Chinese democrats can
operate and more tools by which they can communicate, is to speak
utter nonsense, and, one hopes, a majority of Congress will see it
as such.

SOURCE: MLS `HOPEFUL' TO HAVE HERNANDEZ IN L.A.   TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Major League Soccer officials in New York said they
were ``very hopeful'' that Mexican standout Luis Hernandez would
arrive in Los Angeles late Monday or early today to join his new
Galaxy teammates in time for Wednesday's game in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   A Galaxy source said that Hernandez and MLS officials have
agreed to terms on a multiyear contract, but they have not
finalized a transfer fee with Tigres of Monterrey, Hernandez's
Mexican club team. Hernandez is under contract with Tigres for
another season.
</P>
<P>
   One MLS official who requested anonymity said he expected the
transfer fee to be finalized late Monday, possibly leading to an
official announcement this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, tired of speculating on Hernandez's
arrival, said he will wait for word from MLS like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing new to report,'' Schmid said
Monday. ``I'll come to work tomorrow and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS officials expected to announce Hernandez's signing Friday,
but Tigres is in the process of changing ownership, which
complicated the contract and transfer fee negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of speculation that Hernandez would join the Galaxy in
Dallas this past Friday night, a crowd of 20,417 attended the
Burn-Galaxy match at the Cotton Bowl, which ended in a 1-1 draw. It
was the fifth largest crowd in Burn history, giving MLS officials
an idea of Hernandez's drawing power.
</P>
<P>
   In one development Monday, Clint Mathis reported to the Galaxy's
practice Monday at the Rose Bowl. Mathis had not trained with the
team since Wednesday, when Schmid told Mathis and defender Joey
Franchino they would be offered in a special dispersal draft to
make room for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino was not with the team Monday and neither Franchino nor
Mathis attended the Galaxy's game in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Roy Myers, also expected to leave the Galaxy when the
Hernandez deal becomes official, played in the Dallas game Saturday
and hasn't missed a training session.
</P>
<P>
   Schid said he'll make a decision today whether to take
Franchino, Mathis and Myers to San Jose. All three remain property
of the team until the Hernandez deal becomes official. &QL;

WAVES REAP BENEFITS OF NCAA BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Pepperdine lost to Oklahoma State in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament last March, Waves coach Jan van Breda
Kolff was looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the Cowboys didn't dampen van Breda Kolff's trust
that last season's success was a precursor for things to come. The
Waves' regular-season West Coast Conference championship, NCAA
Tournament berth and first-round upset over Indiana was momentum to
build on, van Breda Kolff felt, and he planned to take advantage on
the recruiting trail.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months later it's obvious van Breda Kolff was on to
something. Pepperdine closed its 2000 recruiting class recently
with a late flurry, adding three players van Breda Kolff is
confident will help the Waves in the future and in some cases,
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Waves landed five players, filling holes at point
guard and in the frontcourt while adding depth at off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff's hopes of expanding Pepperdine's recruiting
base beyond California didn't materialize, but he's certain that
will change next year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Waves were locked in on their top guys long before
shocking Indiana, so it was too late to take full advantage of that
excitement nationally. But they've already targeted some intriguing
out-of-state prospects for 2001, and van Breda Kolff expects the
interest to be mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see the fruits of our labor even more later this
summer when we go see some of those players,'' van Breda Kolff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players coming in next year, van Breda Kolff is
especially high on Micah McKinney, a 6-foot-3 point guard from
Dominguez High of Compton. McKinney helped lead the Dons to the
mythical high school national championship after capturing the
Southern Section Division II title and the Division II State
Championship. His maturity, aggressiveness and court awareness
could land McKinney a starting job as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Waves, who need a replacement for Tezale Archie,
McKinney's development is critical. Archie was a catalyst for
Pepperdine's frenzied offense and chief instigator in its
full-court press. In close games, it was Archie taking most of the
big shots, and he developed into an unofficial team spokesmen
during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff notices some of those qualities in McKinney. The
only question is how quickly he can make the adjustment from high
school to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically and mentally we feel he can play as a freshman,''
van Breda Kolff said. ``He's very strong mentally, and he's an
outgoing kid on and off the court. Obviously we have some big shoes
to fill with Tezale, but Micah is going to be a player we can put
in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's 2000 class reflects the style of play van Breda
Kolff brought to the Waves, an up-tempo system that relies on
pressure defense, turnovers and points in transition. The key is
versatile players and a high volume of athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   It's a style most young players enjoy, providing them space and
opportunities to showcase their skills. That, coupled with the
Waves' on-court success and the fact they played their last three
games on national television certainly didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   When van Breda Kolff and his assistants visited with players,
they found willing listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the attention we got by playing in
the NCAA Tournament helped us get that national exposure.'' van
Breda Kolff said. ``People saw how we played, with the trapping and
getting up and down the court and that was appealing. Nowadays,
that's how kids want to play, so that helped tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves also added two more athletic players in Michael Hall
from Pacific and Robert Turner, a 6-9 forward, from Western of
Anaheim. Van Breda Kolff expects both to flourish with the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's other two newcomers are 6-8 forward Will Kimball, a
teammate of Hall at Pacific, and Glen McGowan, a 6-9 forward from
Notre Dame (Mass.) Academy. McGowan was a prep standout at Venice
High.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good group of kids and we're looking forward to getting
them in here and seeing what they can do,'' van Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves did suffer one setback. Assistant coach Chris Walker,
a trusted confidant to van Breda Kolff, left to become an assistant
at Villanova, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and van Breda Kolff developed a strong friendship and
working relationship over the past four years, beginning at
Vanderbilt when van Breda Kolff was the head coach there. His
departure is a significant blow Walker is an excellent recruiter
and possesses a keen basketball mind, two qualities van Breda Kolff
will sorely miss.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's a step in the right direction for Walker,
who could be in position to take over as head coach at Villanova in
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed him as an assistant and a friend these last four
years. As a coach, he is outstanding in every way,'' van Breda
Kolff said. ``I would have loved to have him stay, but at the same
time this is a terrific career move so I'm happy for him. But there
is no question he will be missed.'' &QL;

BIG LOSSES FOR VASP AND 3 COMPETITORS THREATEN BRAZILIAN AIRLINES 

</HEADLINE>
  By JENNIFER L. RICH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The Brazilian airline Vasp has since January
received at least two federal threats to ground its fleet for
failure to pay airport fees. Last month IBM seized four of Vasp's
mainframe computers and 200 personal computers because of
delinquent bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the really bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Vasp's MD-11 jetliners were repossessed two weeks ago,
forcing the carrier to cancel all intercontinental flights. And a
court order grounded three smaller 737 Vasp aircraft used on the
heavily traveled Rio-Sao Paulo route. An appeals judge has
temporarily restored the 737s to Vasp's use, but the future of that
route, and the airline, is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   With growing debts now estimated at more than $1.8 billion, Vasp
is in the worst shape of Brazil's major airlines, with losses last
year of nearly $53 million. But Vasp's three main competitors are
not particularly healthy either. Varig, the largest airline, lost
$54 million last year. Transbrasil lost $50 million. TAM lost a
record $74 million.
</P>
<P>
   Their predicament reflects what the industry executives call the
hostile financial and regulatory environment for air transportation
in Latin America's largest economy. All the airlines have asked the
government to make drastic changes in the country's aviation
policies to ensure that the domestic industry will survive stronger
international competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has to do its part, not just to reduce costs,
but to stimulate the entrance of new capital or new carriers in the
Brazilian market,'' said Claudio Toledo, an economist and aviation
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how quickly the government will respond to the
industry's requests. But there is widespread agreement that the
Brazilian airline industry is in the midst of its worst crisis in
recent years. The devaluation of the real, Brazil's currency, in
January 1999 increased the industry's dollar-denominated debt load
by 30 percent overnight. Fuel and leasing costs were similarly
affected, at a time when economic weakness kept many Brazilian
travelers at home. According to Brazil's Department of Civil
Aviation, demand for international air travel fell about 14 percent
in 1999, causing all of the major carriers to cancel or reroute
flights.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to halt the losses, TAM and Transbrasil
completed a code-sharing agreement a few weeks ago, which will
initially reduce by 16 the number of Transbrasil's daily flights
between Rio and Sao Paulo. As a result, the company will return six
leased aircraft. Although the two companies say that the agreement
is simply a business partnership, industry experts expect the
airlines to merge eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Varig, which dominates the international market, has taken steps
to cut costs. Last year it returned 14 leased planes and laid off
employees to help save money.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Swissair said it was talking to all four Brazilian
carriers about possible alliances that could lead to an equity
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian carriers insist that they cannot return to health
on their own. One of their biggest complaints is that
government-imposed price ceilings restrict companies from charging
variable rates on tickets, one of the most common ways for airlines
in the United States to fill planes. Unlike air passengers in the
United States, a Brazilian pleasure traveler who books a ticket two
months in advance pays the same price as a businessman who buys his
ticket at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing structure is frankly archaic,'' said Brigadier
Mauro Gandra, executive director of the National Syndicate of
Airlines, a trade group. ``If companies could charge business
travelers higher ticket prices, they could reduce prices for
regular passengers. It would stimulate domestic air travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since only 2 percent of Brazil's 165 million people have ever
flown, the market has the potential to grow rapidly if the price
were right. Indeed, as the economy recovers, industry groups expect
the demand for domestic air travel to jump about 10 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from international routes has helped offset domestic
losses. But it is precisely in the international routes where
Brazil's lack of competitiveness is most visible. Ten years ago,
Brazil's then-flagship carrier, Varig, accounted for 65 percent of
international passengers. Today, all four airlines combined account
for less than 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the North American market alone, Vasp, Varig, Transbrasil and
Tam offer 50 weekly flights to the United States, while their four
main U.S. competitors _ American, Continental, United and Delta _
provide 101 flights to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that there are too many Brazilian
carriers going after a limited number of international travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to have four different companies flying
internationally,'' said Fernando Pinto, the president of Varig.
``We aren't competitive and it's the country that winds up
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vasp's international cutbacks, Pinto said Varig's occupancy
rate on international flights had already started to creep up. He
said an eventual merger of Tam and Transbrasil would help as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation workers' unions have expressed concern, though, that a
decreasing number of airlines would mean far fewer jobs and would
turn the industry into an anticompetitive cartel. They argue that
the government must devise a way to help companies be more
competitive, while providing incentives for new capital to enter
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies themselves have the conditions to be
efficient,'' said Graziella Baggio, president of the National
Aeronautics Union. ``But financing costs, leasing costs, airport
costs, taxes are all too high.''

ADVERTISING: COMMERCIAL ACTORS' STRIKE FOLLOWS A CONFERENCE TO
BERMUDA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at some of the highlights, lowlights and
sidelights of the 2000 management conference of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies, held last week in Southampton,
Bermuda:
</P>
<P>
   SOLIDARITY FOREVER? A last-minute addition to the agenda of the
conference was a presentation on the two-week-old strike against
the association, known as the Four A's, and its counterpart, the
Association of National Advertisers, by two unions that represent
commercial actors, the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Shepard, counsel to the committee of the two associations
negotiating with the unions, began his upbeat assessment of the
strike from the management perspective with this quotation from an
editorial in The Wall Street Journal on May 2, the day after the
strike began: ``When the Screen Actors Guild is striking, the joke
goes, you can't find a waiter.'' The audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But the unions struck back, so to speak, by finding a way to
make their presence felt directly by the conference attendees, who
are top executives at the agencies that produce the commercials in
which the actors appear. On Friday night, a tugboat loudly blowing
its horn followed the ships taking the attendees to a dinner at the
Royal Navy Dockyard. Attached to the side of the tugboat was a
large sign with a message urging a ``fair contract for SAG/AFTRA.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, when the attendees returned to their rooms at the
Fairmont Southampton Princess hotel, they found under their doors a
leaflet listing dozens of striking members of the unions. The list
appeared under this headline: ``Just a short list of talent that
advertising agencies will not be delivering to their clients''
until the strike is settled.
</P>
<P>
   NAME THAT PRODUCT. The members of the Four A's are always paying
attention to brand names because most advertisers hire them to
promote those products. For instance, at a reception sponsored by
executives of TBWA Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, the
liquors served were Absolut vodka and other brands marketed by a
big TBWA client, the Seagram Co.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, however, was the first to be held in Bermuda and
exposed attendees to some brands they rarely see. The Esso brand,
which long ago became Exxon in the United States, is still in use
at gasoline stations around the island. Among the other unfamiliar
names were: Cadbury Crunchie candy bars, the Daihatsu Applause,
Humpty Dumpty potato chips, Lantic sugar, Outerbridge's Original
Sherry Rum Peppers Sauce and the Toyota Lite Ace.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees already seemed to have some familiarity with one brand
from Bermuda: Gosling's Black Seal rum. There was also an
automobile that ought to become a favorite among agency creative
executives hoping to win more awards: the Renault Clio.
</P>
<P>
   IS `ICON' SHORT FOR `ICONOCLASTIC'? There was some lively
discussion during a panel that was part of the general session on
Friday, devoted to the ``new, young icons'' among creative
executives at smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the moderator, Andrew Jaffe, executive director at
the Clio Awards, part of VNU USA, asked the panelists to discuss
agencies that form stand-alone interactive advertising operations.
He gave as an example iDeutsch, the interactive unit of Deutsch
Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is iDeutsch a site about Donny?'' asked Alex Bogusky, vice
chairman and creative director at Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky in
Miami, referring to Donny Deutsch, the larger-than-life chief
executive at Deutsch. ``Is it all about Donny?''
</P>
<P>
   SPILL THE WINE. At another panel on Friday about creativity, Ken
Mandelbaum, chief creative officer at BBDO West in Los Angeles and
San Francisco, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, was
asked to discuss trends on the West Coast, where many clients are
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelbaum said he had been compiling a reel of the best
commercials of the 1980s created by West Coast agencies, which were
``all for wine coolers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels are terrifying,'' he added as the audience
laughed. ``We all know what happened to the wine cooler industry.''
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS. For decades, the Four A's conference held in the
spring was known as the annual meeting. In recent years, as the
format was changed to focus on topics of interest to agency
managers _ and conferences were added to appeal to media and
creative executives _ that description was modified. First the
event was called the management conference and annual meeting, then
the words ``annual meeting'' were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   With that change, the venerable association also eliminated
almost all references to the conference's place in Four A's
history. So for those of you at home who keep track of such things,
it was the 82nd annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   COINING A PHRASE. All during the conference, attendees were
closely following the developments in London and New York as Sir
Martin Sorrell, chief executive at the WPP Group, finally reached
an agreement to acquire Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. after weeks of
on-again, off-again negotiations centered on honing the financial
terms of the deal. That provided fodder for several speakers,
including Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman of BBDO New York, part of
the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees enjoyed watching Bermudians ``diving for coins,''
Dusenberry said in a speech on Saturday after he formally became
the 2000-2001 chairman of the Four A's, ``and watching Martin
Sorrell trying to take the coins away from them.''

FIVE YEARS LATER, STUDENTS JUSTIFY CHEATING IN ACADEMIC CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Five years after shaming their school by cheating to
win a statewide academic contest, some of the former Steinmetz High
School students on the quiz team now say they have a single regret:
getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apologize for what?'' Jolie Fitch, one of those caught
cheating asked defiantly. ``I would do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow former teammate on the academic decathlon team, Tom
O'Donnell, said he felt no guilt about using a pilfered test to
memorize the answers. That is simply the way the world works, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the first time there was cheating,'' he said, ``and
it won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the former Steinmetz students had gathered here for a
recent screening of an HBO movie, ``Cheaters,'' which is based on
the 1995 cheating scandal that embroiled this city in a debate over
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher of the team, Jerry Plecki, has expressed
remorse for his part in the cheating scheme. But the confession
rang hollow to Gary Marconi, a Cook County prosecutor who
investigated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, you denied it and denied it and denied it,'' said
Marconi, who rose in the audience to grill the teacher about
cheating. ``Now that a movie is coming along, now all of a sudden
you confess.''
</P>
<P>
   Plecki offered little response to the accusation. He is being
paid an undisclosed sum by HBO for the rights to his life story.
</P>
<P>
   When working-class Steinmetz High School won the statewide
academic decathlon championship in 1995, toppling a prestigious
magnet school, Whitney Young, the student scholars were hailed in
Chicago as heroic underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cinderella team!'' the principal at Steinmetz had exulted.
</P>
<P>
   But when the decathlon board analyzed the extraordinarily high
test scores by the Steinmetz students, questions about cheating
arose. The Academic Decathlon Association, one of the nation's most
prestigious academic championships, had discovered, among other
peculiarities, that only 12 students in the nation had posted a
score of 900 or better on the math quiz, and six of those students
were from Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   After the decathlon board demanded that the Steinmetz scholars
take a ``validation test,'' the students and the teacher refused,
saying indignantly that they were victims of snob assumptions that
a poorer school could never achieve so brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   The decathlon association stripped Steinmetz of the title.
Plecki, who has a doctorate degree, lost his job. And scholars from
Whitney Young went on to win second in the national academic
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Plecki, 48, offers no excuses for the cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrong, and I take full responsibility,'' Plecki said.
``We did it so we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that no school would ever hire him as a teacher, Plecki
now runs a business in Chicago; he refused to say what kind of
business. He never faced criminal charges for the cheating. Indeed,
he never publicly admitted the cheating until now.
</P>
<P>
   After a student on the Steinmetz team stole a copy of the test,
the decathlon teammates looked up the answers and memorized them.
Plecki helped plot the cheating, and later urged the students to
keep the misdeed a secret.
</P>
<P>
   In justifying the cheating, some of the former Steinmetz
students say the odds in the decathlon competition were stacked in
favor of Whitney Young, a selective enrollment school with highly
praised programs for academically gifted students.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say Chicago school officials could scarcely
preach to anyone about ethics. In the same year that the Steinmetz
team cheated, the president of the school board, Sharon Grant, was
jailed for income tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch, 23, said she went on attend Illinois State University,
where she majored in chemistry, but dropped out of college two
months before earning a bachelor's degree. She is now working at a
department store in the Chicago suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, 22, said he now works for an automotive service and
supply store.
</P>
<P>
   A third student on the team, who declined to give his name, said
the cheating was justified because Steinmetz students had felt
``bullied'' by the superior attitudes and condescension shown by
students from Whitney Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever had somebody come up to your face and tell you
how stupid you are?'' he asked. ``That's what happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steinmetz team was composed of nine students, including some
of the top scholars in the school and the student body president.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch, who now has a baby, said people sometimes asked how she
would react if her own child cheated in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' she said, saying that cheating without a good
purpose would be unacceptable. ``But I couldn't say no, never.''

CAPRIATI UPSET IN ITALIAN OPEN PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In need of a mentor, Jennifer Capriati found an effective
one last year in Harold Solomon, the former member of the men's top
10 who had already helped Mary Joe Fernandez win on a regular
basis. With his guidance, Capriati, the former teen-age phenom,
managed to rebuild her confidence and her resume and reach the
semifinals at this year's Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday in Rome, when Capriati, 24, returned to competitive
tennis after a seven-week layoff, Solomon was no longer part of her
team. According to both parties, they have split amicably, and only
time and future tournaments will tell if Capriati's uneven, and
ultimately unsuccessful, performance in the first round of the
Italian Open was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Looking heavier than before her injury-imposed break, Capriati
struggled with her serve _ double-faulting 13 times _ and with her
consistency off the ground, losing, 6-3, 7-5, to Anne-Gaelle Sidot,
a gifted, erratic and unproven Frenchwoman ranked 31st in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since I played a match, so maybe I just
didn't feel as comfortable out there,'' said the clearly miffed
Capriati, who uncharacteristically shouted at herself at one stage
in the final set.
</P>
<P>
   Sidot, a lean 20-year-old left-hander with a wicked one-handed
backhand, was once considered more promising than her French
contemporary Amelie Mauresmo. She has not managed to keep pace,
although she managed to match Capriati's baseline power in
sometimes spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take her long to determine that this Capriati was not
as fit as that Capriati. ``During the match I realized that she was
a bit sluggish and her movement much less speedy,'' Sidot said. ``I
tried to make her run, but even though I knew she had put on some
weight. She still has shots that hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's improved conditioning was one of the keys to her run
of fine performances, which began a year ago with a tournament
victory in Strasbourg, France, and continued until this March in
Key Biscayne, Fla., where she reached the quarterfinals. But by
then, she already had tendinitis in one of her Achilles' tendons _
an injury that forced her to withdraw from Hilton Head and,
according to Capriati, kept her from practicing and working on her
fitness for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been able the last couple weeks, you know, to train
normal,'' she said. ``It's just sore more than anything, but it's
fine. I mean I feel in good shape and still want to be in better
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Solomon made the decision to stop working together
shortly after Key Biscayne. According to both parties, they did so
because Capriati wanted a full-time coach and Solomon wanted to
spend more time with his family in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and less
time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she still has the capability to win a Grand Slam,'' he
said of Capriati. ``Going forward for Jennifer is up to Jennifer.
If she wants to continue to work really hard and be as dedicated as
she has been in the last year with everything, the sky's the limit.
If not, she will, like everyone, have a more difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati came to Rome with her father, Stefano, her boyfriend
and the ATP Tour player Xavier Malisse and a new coach, Rikard
Bergh, whom Capriati considers helpful but temporary.

GORE'S PERSONALITY VIEWED UNFAVORABLY BY MANY VOTERS, TIMES POLL
SHOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   While many Americans find Vice President Al Gore's issue
positions more appealing, he is not as well liked personally or
viewed as commanding a leader as Gov. George W. Bush, the latest
New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lackluster favorability ratings may help explain why Bush
has emerged at this early stage as the preferred candidate across
the demographic spectrum, including three critical groups that
voted Democratic in 1996: Catholics, independents and
Northeasterners. Voters, in fact, are so lukewarm toward Gore that
he is widely perceived as a loser: By a margin of nearly 2-1, they
expect Bush to capture the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Gore
may be heartened that vice presidents are often overshadowed by the
president they serve until they can distinguish themselves on a
national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this
time 12 years ago, Bush's father, then the vice president, trailed
Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to win a lopsided
victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   And the survey illuminated potential rough patches for the Texas
governor. For one thing, voters have qualms with his plan, which he
outlined on Monday, that would allow workers to invest part of
their payroll taxes in private accounts. Most Americans said the
stock market was a perilous place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also seemed skeptical of Bush's proposed tax cut of $483
billion over five years _ a measure that Gore has condemned as a
``risky tax scheme.'' Even 57 percent of people who said they
planned to vote for Bush were uncertain of the effect of that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will also have to cautiously navigate roiling factions in
his own ranks. Three out of 10 Republican voters said if the
governor picks a running mate who supports legalized abortion, they
would be less likely to support him. About a third of all voters
said religious conservatives carry too much influence in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone survey was conducted last Wednesday
through Saturday with 947 adults, including 716 registered voters.
The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three to four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most promising news for Gore is that he scored well
with voters on issues they say that are at the top of their agenda,
like health care, education and Social Security. He is also seen as
more caring than Bush, despite the governor's slogan that he is a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that his issues are popular and that the economy seems
strong, the nagging difficulty that has confounded the vice
president's advisers and many Democrats is why his overall ratings
are not more competitive with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters, Bush is leading Gore by eight percentage
points, 47 to 39. Bush holds a wide advantage among men, 50 to 36
percentage points; among women, Gore drew 42 percent, Bush, 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's lagging ratings appear to have more to do
with personality than policy. Gore is seen favorably by 34 percent
of registered voters and unfavorable by 36 percent. By contrast,
Bush is seen as favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by only 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A related problem that has dogged Gore is that Bush is viewed as
more of a leader. Fifty-three percent of registered voters in the
new poll said Gore has strong leadership qualities; 63 percent said
the same thing about Bush. The contrast is striking, particularly
since Gore had been an elected official since 1976, when he was
elected to the House from Tennessee; Bush was not elected governor,
his first office, until 1994. That said, though, Gore has spent the
past seven years in the shadow of a president who consistently
draws high ratings for the job he has done in office.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who responded to the poll explained in follow-up
interviews that there were not specific issues upon which they
split sharply with Gore. Rather, they often cited more intangible
factors: his personal characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has not really shown a lot of leadership qualities or
abilities to be in a position to run our nation,'' said Ken Bogler,
27, a labor representative from Somerset, N.J., who is an
independent. ``It's a presence, really. The way he carries himself,
the way he speaks, does not seem presidential.'' He added, ``Issues
don't play a big part in my support. Nine times out of 10, the
candidates change their positions once they get into office any
way. He may have the experience, but if you don't have the
confidence and the abilities of someone who can handle the job, you
don't give him the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Jeane, 71, a retired nurse from Bay City, Texas, who is a
Democrat, put it this way: `Al Gore acts as if he's not sure what
he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own. He doesn't
seem to be strong enough in his opinions and as a leader to be
president. Bush seems to be a stronger man with more definitive
opinions. And I think he would make a better leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, said he was not
discouraged by such critiques _ and insisted that voters would
defect from Bush when his policy stands are articulated in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the issues that are out there today,'' he said. ``As
we get to the general election, we're going to be forcing a
debate.'' Citing how Gore has inched up in the polls since last
year, Coelho added, ``We've made up a lot of points with George
Bush. I feel very good about where we are compared to six months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than three in 10 voters saying they were pay a lot of
attention to the campaign, the candidates have not yet been able to
fully define themselves to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in particular, has made little headway in trumpeting his
programs for cutting taxes and overhauling the Social Security
system. Only nine percent of registered voters in the poll said
they knew a great deal about Bush's tax blueprint; 58 percent said
they had no idea whether his plan would help or hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   By a margin of 4-1, the public still prefers using any budget
surplus to shore up Social Security rather than cut income taxes _
even as a majority said it might be possible to do both.
</P>
<P>
   In a finding that raises questions about the Social Security
proposal Bush discussed on Monday, Americans are closely divided
over whether individuals should be allowed to invest portions of
their Social Security taxes on their own.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to put aside their presidential preferences and focus
on issues, Gore was considered more capable in tackling Social
Security and education, traditional Democratic strengths. But the
candidates were viewed about evenly in handling gun control, which
had long been viewed as a Democratic issue, and on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also identified stark ideological differences between the
candidates. For all of the efforts by Bush and Gore to court
moderates, voters do not see them as moderates. Forty-three percent
of registered voters said they think of Bush as a conservative
while 34 percent said they think he is a moderate. Similarly, 43
percent cast Gore as a liberal, while 30 percent said he was more a
moderate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush has been unable to shake the idea advanced by gun control
advocates that the National Rifle Association would wield
considerable influence in a Bush administration. Voters were three
times more likely to say that Bush would be influenced greatly by
the NRA than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the follow-up interviews, some voters, citing character
considerations, lamented that Sen. John McCain, who was defeated by
Bush in the Republican primaries, would not be on any ticket. In
fact, McCain has maintained far more impressive favorability
ratings then Bush or Gore: 46 percent have a favorable view of him;
only 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see in Gore or Bush that clear definitive leadership
quality that McCain had,'' said Tim Olkar, 22, a student in
Wheaton, Ill., who is an independent. Speaking of Gore, he said,
``He seems kind of wishy-washy as a candidate and seems to be
running a negative campaign. Bush seems a little more genuine to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the candidates themselves, the Democratic and Republican
parties are now seen more favorably than less so by voters. The
Republican Party, in particular, has rebounded to its standing
before the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, which
took a toll on the party.
</P>
<P>
   There was no upswing for the Reform Party, which seems poised to
nominate Pat Buchanan as its standard bearer. The party is seen
twice as negatively as positively.

   Jones Mauls Hall
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hall's game but losing performance against Roy Jones Jr.
Saturday night produced three unexpected fans for the
light-heavyweight challenger: HBO's announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lampley, George Foreman and Larry Merchant declared that
Hall was overmatched _ that was obvious, especially in two rounds
when Hall landed only two punches _ but they admired his courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' Lampley said in the seventh round.
``Richard Hall has guts.'' Later, in the ninth round, Lampley
added, ``I'm embarrassed when I said three weeks ago this would be
an egregious mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Merchant: ``He's one brave dude, Richard Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ninth round, the announcers started lobbying for the
referee Wayne Kelly to stop the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absurd!'' Lampley cried with 1 minute 54 seconds left
in the 11th. ``Stop the fight. Stop it, Wayne. Come on. This isn't
competitive anymore. It's a bloodletting.'' After Kelly declared a
technical knockout, Merchant added, ``The referee ought to be
pistol-whipped for allowing that to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   An excessive punishment, but Merchant would not have said it if
Jones did not insist on fighting mandatory challengers whom talent
bypassed. Last year, he dispatched an embarrassing mandatory,
Richard Frazier, the World Boxing Council's No. 1 contender, in the
second round. Hall was the World Boxing Association's top
contender. And Jones is looking to face the International Boxing
Federation's highest-ranked challenger, to be chosen from the
winner of the little-anticipated Antonio Tarver-Eric Harding bout.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones does not want to lose any of his belts and HBO cannot
force him to surrender a belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maddening,'' said Seth Abraham, the president of Time
Warner Sports. ``For Roy, the belts represent a level of status
that we don't hear from Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya and Naseem
Hamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, HBO could pay Jones his millions and not televise a
gross mismatch, Abraham said, ``but if we didn't, we'd open
ourselves up to a breach of contract lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one fight remains on Jones' HBO contract. The fight must be
on TVKO pay-per-view, for which Jones is guaranteed no money. And
he will face Tarver or Harding, unless he wants to lose his IBF
belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy will earn whatever the public thinks that fight is
worth,'' Abraham said. Which won't be much. Jones' pay-per-view
appeal has been compromised by the weak light-heavyweight division.
Even Jones' talent can't make up for a mismatch when fans are asked
to pay $40 or $50. His appeal would increase if he moves into the
heavyweight division, if only for the novelty, even if the opponent
is a small heavyweight like Chris Byrd. A title fight against Lewis
could be a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Airwaves
</P>
<P>
   The four National Basketball Association playoff games Saturday
and Sunday on NBC produced an average 5.8 overnight Nielsen rating,
down 13 percent from a 6.7 for two weekend games on the comparable
weekend in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To golf fans angered by CBS Sports' abrupt departure from the
Byron Nelson Classic on Sunday before Jesper Parnevik won on the
third sudden-death hole, add one more dissenting voice: the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving the playoff at 6:38 p.m., ET, CBS violated its
contract with the Tour, which requires it to stick with coverage
until at least 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday, the PGA Tour pronounced itself
``deeply disappointed'' with CBS. The Tour added that the network
had made assurances ``that an occurrence such as yesterday's, which
has never before happened with a CBS telecast of a PGA Tour event,
will not be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS' decision to withdraw before Parnevik and Davis Love III
teed off on the third playoff hole was not a golf decision. It was
all about entertainment, and the sanctity of the night's prime-time
schedule: ``60 Minutes,'' followed by ``Touched By An Angel,'' and
Part 1 of ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time was the golf tournament _ a nonmajor, no less _ to
delay for a nanosecond the start of prime-time during a crucial
sweeps month.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Jesus' was on the cover of virtually everybody's TV book and
we didn't want to push back prime-time,'' LeslieAnne Wade, a
spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said.
</P>
<P>
   As the tournament passed its expected 6 p.m. conclusion, CBS
made a rough calculation that the third sudden-death playoff hole
would not end until at least 7:02, with no guarantee that it would
be the last. So CBS chose to bail out at 6:38, after the second
hole, rather than show Parnevik and Love at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, CBS's calculation was wrong: Parnevik won at the
third playoff hole, at 6:58 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody feels good about this,'' Wade said. ``These are
split-second decisions done with inexact math.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Tiger Woods been playing Love, CBS might have hung around to
show Woods hit his tee shot on the third playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger would have added another component, but we would have
done the same thing,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   The reflexive thought is that CBS would not dare pre-empt Woods
if he was in a position to win. But on this Sunday, even Tiger _
said to have messianic qualities by his father _ would have found
it hard to compete with ``Jesus'' in CBS's eye.
</P>
<P>
   From 9 to 10 p.m. ``Jesus'' battled ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' Between 9 and 9:30, ``Jesus'' won, with a 14.9
Nielsen rating to ``Millionaire's'' 13.3. But from 9:30 to 10,
Regis struck back, winning 15.6-15.2.
</P>
<P>
   The Byron Nelson, incidentally, generated a 4.0 overnight
rating.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS will never cut away from golf again before 7 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``Jesus II: The Return.''

KNIGHT KEEPS HIS JOB AT INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Despite a seven-week investigation that concluded
that Bobby Knight displayed a ``pattern of inappropriate behavior''
that had embarrassed Indiana University, the school's president
said Monday that the long-time Hoosier basketball coach deserved a
``last chance'' and will be allowed to continue as coach.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Myles Brand, said Knight would be suspended for
three games next season and fined $30,000, and that he would serve
as coach under a ``zero tolerance'' policy that would be
stringently enforced. Brand threatened to dismiss Knight if he has
inappropriate physical contact with players or other members of the
university community or does not conduct himself with ``decorum and
civility'' on occasions when Knight is representing Indiana, such
as on the bench and in news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, along with the two university trustees who conducted the
investigation, conceded they were troubled by what Brand called
``persistent and systematic'' abusive behavior by the Hall of Fame
coach, who has brought Indiana three national titles in his 29
years as an icon in a basketball-crazy state.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation concluded that Knight grabbed a former player,
Neil Reed, by the neck for 2.3 seconds, had intimidated a
64-year-old secretary in the athletic department with foul language
and a thrown vase, and that he got into abusive arguments as well
as physical altercations with colleagues and subordinates. Still,
Brand, who had the final decision, said that there was ``no
incident by itself that rose to the level of termination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ethical approach is to give him one last chance,''
Brand said at a news conference. ``He has given me his word that he
will take extraordinary steps to change behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have established tough, specific guidelines to send a clear
message that abusive and embarrassing behavior will not be
tolerated,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight did not attend the news conference. John Walda, one of
the trustees who led the investigation, read a statement by Knight
in which he said he had ``absolutely no problem with the
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment of effective and proper guidelines can in
the long run help me become a better coach,'' the statement said.
``As I have said before, I recognized that I have a problem with my
temper. For those times it has ever caused me to do anything that
gave anyone understandable and justifiable reason to be upset, I am
sincerely sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Knight would apologize to Jeanette Hartgraves, the
secretary whom Knight had bullied by throwing a vase in her office
in 1988. But the Indiana president said the general apology would
suffice for those involved in the other incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involved accusations that Knight had choked
and punched then-assistant sports information director Kit
Klingelhoffer in the mid-1970s; accosted then-assistant coach Ron
Felling in late 1999; upbraided his boss, athletic director
Clarence Doninger, in a near altercation earlier this year, and
that Knight choked Reed, the former player, at a practice in 1997,
an allegation that spurred the overall inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Walda said the Reed incident, which was caught on videotape, was
``clearly inappropriate,'' but stopped short of characterizing it
as a choking action and pointed out that the player was not
injured. ``We are resolved that if coach Knight persists in this
type of contact, it will not be tolerated,'' Walda said.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the investigation, he said that 29 people were
interviewed, including 12 athletic department employees and 7
former players.
</P>
<P>
   Walda said Reed's charge that Knight brandished soiled toilet
paper to motivate his team had ``little credibility.'' He also
dismissed Reed's allegation that Brand was banished by Knight from
a Hoosier practice.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Sunday's trustees meeting, where the inquiry
findings were given to eight of the nine trustees, Knight issued a
statement acknowledging that his temper had led him into
confrontations and promising to work harder at developing a more
diplomatic approach. He also made it clear he wanted to keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   But Brand acknowledged that it was a two-hour meeting with the
coach at the president's home on Saturday night that had brought
his decision not to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversation I had with Bob was clearly unique,'' Brand
said. ``I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic. As the
discussion proceeded and Bob expressed the view that he very much
wanted to change his behavior, then we began to talk about
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The university president had come to Knight's defense in 1998
when the coach's support seemed to be eroding after a history of
boorish behavior and, by Indiana standards, sub-par seasons. Brand,
along with Walda, authored a letter citing Knight's average of 23
victories a season, a 77 percent graduation rate - nearly double
the national average for college basketball - and the fact the
program never ran afoul of the NCAA under Knight's 29-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the same factors Monday and expressed confidence the
volatile coach could live up to the tough, new guidelines set
before him. ``He will give it as good a try as he can,'' Brand
said. ``He has a good chance to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the university community, however, was as
hopeful -- or happy -- about the prospect of Knight getting another
chance to check his behavior no matter how hyper vigilant his
superiors are about enforcing the guidelines. Brand named Doninger,
the athletic director, as the chair of a new commission to come up
with a code of conduct for all university coaches. Doninger, who
was upset that he wasn't a part of the inquiry, says he is not sure
he will remain as athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   In light of their recent clashes, he was asked if he could get
along with Knight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I could get along with anybody. With the
guidelines, I think I can get along with coach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some faculty members were appalled but hardly
surprised Knight received another chance. Dave Pisoni, a
chancellors' professor of psychology and cognitive science, says
Brand and the trustees got what they wanted - for Knight to stay -
and it has sent a terrible message within the state and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It displays the lack of principled leadership that we have at
the university. You really didn't think they were going to fire
Bobby Knight,'' said Pisoni. ``Our image is not tarnished, but
irreparably damaged. It sends the message that athletics are more
important than academics. That marketing and revenues streams means
more than scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Knight's current players, Dane Fife, may have spoken
for the coach's supporters when he suggested there was only one way
for Knight to quell the debate over his fitness to represent
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be under a microscope, but we're going to help
him'' said the sophomore guard. ``I'm pretty sure if we won a lot
of games and won a national championship, it would cure all of
this.''

   Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife, Cherie, who is to give birth

to challenge a government restriction on who is covered by a
provision permitting parents to take 13 weeks of unpaid leave to

KOSOVARS CHANGING CANADIAN PRAIRIE
</HEADLINE>

   LETHBRIDGE, Alberta _ Here in Canada's big sky country, midway
between Medicine Hat and the Continental Divide, Blerina Hoxha sat
in her apartment and recalled the day one year ago, back in the
Balkans, when she stood in the rain at a tent camp, running her
finger down a list. Next to her family's name was written
``Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about Canada,'' Hoxha, 19, an Albanian
refugee, said. ``We didn't ask to go to Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   She was speaking in her family's new home here. One year after
their arrival last May, she speaks enough English to interview for
a sales job at a dress shop, a step up from her job at a McDonald's
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother Gezim, 14, bicycles on Saturday mornings to the
library, where he cruises the Internet. In speaking with friends,
he often ends sentences with a Canadian ``eh.'' For spending money,
he rises six days a week at 5 a.m. to deliver 47 copies of The
Lethbridge Herald around their suburban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   One year after more than a million Kosovo Albanians fled the
Serbian province, North America is proving to be the world's most
welcoming region for refugees who want to become immigrants. With
the weather warming and security said to be improving in Kosovo,
Western European nations and Australia are pushing, in some cases
forcing, 250,000 refugees to return to their devastated homeland.
Germany, with 170,000 Kosovar refugees, has said it will deport
those who refuse a $1,000 incentive to return.
</P>
<P>
   But in Canada and the United States, three-quarters of the
Kosovars who came last year have stayed. Today, almost all are
eligible for residency status. Canada, with about one-tenth the
population of the United States, took in half as many refugees,
7,200, as the United States, which accepted 14,300.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's welcome, although a tradition, reflects a federal
policy of rejuvenating an aging population with immigrants. One in
seven citizens is foreign born. Last year, Canada took in 173,011
immigrants, 75 percent of the government goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised we were so welcomed,'' Rexhep Hoxha, with
lines in his face deeper than his 46 years, said in Albanian as his
daughter Blerina translated. A former curtain inspector in a
Yugoslav factory, Hoxha recalled, ``People waited for us at the
airport as if we were important people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Siemens, a semiretired Mennonite pastor, was at the airport
that day with a ``Welcome to Canada'' banner. The Hoxhas'
``sponsor,'' Siemens said he also remembered their arrival. ``There
was fear in their eyes,'' he said. ``They did not know what was
going to happen. They did not speak any English.''
</P>
<P>
   In this railroad city of 70,000 people, the six Kosovar families
here are part of a changing, more cosmopolitan face of Canadian
prairie cities. Although 1,000 Lethbridge residents were born in
the United States, historically one of Alberta's largest sources of
immigrants, 500 other residents were born in China. At the small
mosque here, the faithful include people born in Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have refugees from Sudan, Bosnia, China, Latvia,
Afghanistan _ quite a diverse population,'' said Jodie Gallais,
settlement counselor for Immigration Services, a
government-financed agency. ``They get money for food, money for
rent, money for bus passes. For the Kosovars, the churches had
apartments ready for them. They were giving them dishes, driving
them places.''
</P>
<P>
   In this small city, where the August Whoop-Up Days rodeo is the
social highlight of the summer, the Kosovar immigrants seem to be
finding a niche.
</P>
<P>
   Blerina Hoxha is becoming accustomed to a flat, enormous
landscape in which speeding pickups send up dust trails visible for
miles around. Before fleeing Kosovo, she said, the farthest she had
traveled was the 30-mile trip from her village to Pristina, the
Kosovo capital. ``The police stopped the bus five or 10 times,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who visited their village after the war said the Serbs
had burned 400 of the 500 houses, including the Hoxhas' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go back, I have to start from the beginning, I have to
start building a house,'' Hoxha, who is beginning to learn English,
said. ``Here it is a good country. No crime. There is freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Makfire, said her ambition was to have their Luzlim,
22, move here after graduating next year from engineering school in
Tirana, Albania. With her other son, Gezim, translating, she said:
``Kosovo _ only to visit. Not to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gezim, a computer buff, inspected a visitor's laptop and
scrolled through an article about plans by Australia, Britain,
France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland to start deporting Kosovo
refugees in the summer. Gezim, who has plans to go to college in
Calgary, said, ``We were lucky.''

LYCOS LEANS TOWARD LINK WITH TELEFONICA OF SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos, one of the nation's biggest Internet portals, has agreed
to be acquired by Telefonica of Spain in a sweeping deal across
borders and languages worth more than $12 billion, a top executive
close to the talks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could be announced as early as Tuesday, would
combine Lycos with Terra Networks, the Internet arm of Telefonica,
and link the new hybrid in an alliance with the German media
conglomerate Bertelsmann, the executive said. The portal would have
millions of users from Europe to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies are expected to call a news conference
Tuesday to announce the union. But until then executives from the
various companies refused to comment about the deal, which would be
the first purchase of a large U.S. Internet company by a European
Internet access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were moving toward an advanced stage late Monday
night, the executive said. He said that Terra would buy Lycos in an
all-stock deal that would swap more than 1.7 Terra shares for each
share of Lycos, or more than $89.06 based on closing prices on
Friday. Shares of Lycos rose $7.50 Monday, to $61.625. Terra
slipped 0.90 euros, to 64 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would give Terra _ a fast-growing European Internet
company _ a wide opening into North America to sell its Web
services to the expanding Hispanic population. And for Bertelsmann,
an alliance would broaden its global reach, allowing the
conglomerate to sell John Grisham novels through Lycos in the
United States or offer Carlos Santana music that can be downloaded
through Telefonica cellular phones in Europe or Terra portals in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The executive said Telefonica would pay Bertelsmann an
undisclosed sum for a 25 percent stake in a new online bookstore
that it would create called Bol.com South America. Bertelsmann will
retain the other 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the executive said two European companies were
expected to sign a five-year agreement that would anoint
Bertelsmann as the ``preferred content provider'' on Lycos in the
United States in exchange for $1 billion. That designation means
that the company's products will get more prominent display,
advertising and special promotions through Lycos portal, which
ranks fourth in size in the United States in terms of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos and Bertelsmann now jointly own Lycos Europe, the
third-most- visited network of Web sites in Germany. The executive
said that the latest agreement called for Bertelsmann to
``consider'' folding the Lycos Europe operation with the U.S.
counterpart by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday who would run the combined companies
after the deal brought together Terra, based in Madrid, and Lycos,
which is based in Waltham, Mass. And the negotiations had not
yielded a new name for the hybrid. The chief negotiators in the
initial discussions included the chairman of Telefonica, Juan
Villalonga, and the chief executive of Lycos, Bob Davis. Over the
last few weeks, Bertelsmann's chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff,
joined in the discussions that were continuing through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the pan-American alliance to a certain extent
reflected the very forces that prompted Time Warner and America
Online to unite in a company that mixed old media and new _ one
offering a rich source of content and the other an Internet
platform.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The media is converging and you've got some very strong
players _ one from the old media and one from the new,'' said
Andrea Williams Rice, the managing director of Deutsche Bank in San
Francisco. ``There's an interest to bring together two players and
make the sum greater than its parts. Lycos could not very
effectively extend its reach into the old-line world. It would have
had to pay a lot of money to pay for the distribution that
Bertelsmann has. And until now, Bertelsmann has not been able to
build an online presence comparable to its offline position.''
</P>
<P>
   The one disadvantage that this new union could face is the
difficulty in integrating companies with three different national
cultures. ``The risk with every merger is that you're bringing
together a number of players with different backgrounds and
agendas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry M. Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, said that the union gave the various companies a
powerful global reach. ``This fits into the ongoing theme of
consolidation where you have a few strong players continue to get
stronger by either merging with each other or acquiring smaller
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has had other suitors in the past, but a union never
happened. Last year, Barry Diller's media company, USA Networks
Inc., tried to buy Lycos, but that pursuit collapsed because of
opposition from Lycos stockholders. The acquisition was canceled
last May amid objections from shareholders led by David Wetherell,
chairman of CMGI Inc., which owns about 15 percent of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica has also recently weathered a failed merger attempt,
with KPN Telecom of the Netherlands. At the behest of the Spanish
government, bankers on the company's board vetoed a $58 billion
merger that would have created Europe's fourth-largest phone
company, with a market value of $125 billion.

   Once-proud basketball league now feels need to promote
</P>
<P>
   By Stan Arey
</P>
<P>
   Amelia Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The big issues at this year's annual meeting of the Atlantic
Coast Conference aren't expansion, location of the treasured
basketball tournament or the improvement of the out-of-league
football schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The big issues are marketing, public relations and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC's image as the nation's premier basketball conference
has slipped. For each of the past two seasons, the league has
managed to place only three teams in the NCAA Tournament ``I would
say that's probably right,'' associate commissioner Tom Mickle said
when asked if the marketing issue will dominate the meetings.
``We've never done any marketing before, because we didn't have to.
Now we're taking a hard look at it, and we will spend a lot of time
discussing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at ourselves,'' associate commissioner Fred
Baracat said. ``It's not like years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Super conference talk
</P>
<P>
   A hot rumor on the Internet has the SEC forming a 16-team super
conference by raiding the ACC to pick off Florida State, Georgia
Tech and Clemson and then dipping into the Big East to grab Miami.
``Nobody has contacted me,'' Tech athletics director Dave Braine
said. ``(FSU athletics director) Dave Hart hasn't said anything. I
had lunch with (Clemson AD) Bobby Robinson today, and he didn't say
anything. Miami hasn't called, which I'm sure they would if
anything was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Improving the competition
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, ESPN, Fox Sports, Home Team Sports, Jefferson-Pilot,
Raycom and The Sunshine Network all came to the meetings with the
same request. The television networks are pushing for the ACC
football teams to upgrade their out-of-conference games. North
Carolina has added Syracuse, Wisconsin, Texas and Notre Dame over
the next few years. Virginia plays Penn State and Notre Dame and
always plays Virginia Tech. Clemson has added Auburn and Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The requests are not new, Mickle said. ``It's a constant refrain
in any meeting regarding television.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's richest
</P>
<P>
   The ACC continues to lead the nation in money paid out to
members. The league paid $60 million this year. That amount will
jump to $70 million by the 2001-2002 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, for the first time in history, football
brought in more money than basketball. Football was responsible for
$32 million this year, while basketball managed $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   The situation will change quickly, however, because the ACC
signed a new 10-year basketball contract in February. By 2002,
basketball will bring in roughly $36 million, while football will
produce $34 million.
</P>
<P>
   No announcement
</P>
<P>
   The ACC will not make an immediate announcement about the site
of the 2005 basketball tournament. Although there is little doubt
the league will go to Tampa and the Washington, D.C., area soon,
details have not been determined.

 &HT;    Foul shots cost Bobby Knight
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight received ``one last chance''
Monday to clean up his act.
</P>
<P>
   University president Miles Brand announced that Knight would
return for his 30th season with the Hoosiers. The coach returns to
Bloomington, however, under a set of specific sanctions and
guidelines for his future behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Violation of any of the guidelines, Brand said, would be cause
for immediate termination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as a zero-tolerance policy concerning his
behavior,'' Brand said at a news conference Monday in Indianapolis.
``These are very specific and very tough guidelines that show that
abusive and embarrassing behavior will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was not there, but John Walda, president of the IU board
of trustees read a statement from the coach that apologized for his
past actions and said he agreed with the new guidelines. Knight
left Monday for a long-planned trip to Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's announcement ended weeks of speculation that Knight, 59,
might be fired or might be forced to resign after an investigation
into his behavior. The investigation began with charges from former
player Neil Reed that Knight had choked him during a 1997 practice.
In April, a videotape confirming Reid's claim was made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken collectively, (the incidents) represented a pattern of
behavior that had to be addressed,'' Brand said. ``And we feel like
we've done that.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Knight issued a public apology for his past
behavior and promised that in the future he would try to do a
better job of controlling his emotions. That evening, he met with
Brand for more than two hours, and the president outlined what
Knight would have to do to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If coach Knight had not agreed to any of these guidelines, I
would have recommended immediate termination,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Knight could change his confrontational
personality after all these years, Brand said, ``I think he will
give it his very best effort. I, for one, believe he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With 763 career wins, Knight is just 116 away from the record of
879 held by former North Carolina coach Dean Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's recent teams, however, have struggled in the NCAA
Tournament. Last season, the Hoosiers finished 20-9 after
Pepperdine eliminated them in the first round by 20 points.

 &HT;    NASCAR family bids Petty farewell
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ The crowd of more than 1,000 stood in silence
as Kyle and Patti Petty entered the gymnasium here Monday to honor
the memory of their oldest child.
</P>
<P>
   Both wore sunglasses to hide the tears. Others wept openly.
</P>
<P>
   The city was filled with friends and visitors from the NASCAR
community to pay final respects to Adam Petty, 19, who died Friday
in New Hampshire during practice for a Busch race. Bill Elliott,
Dale Jarrett, Ward Burton, John Andretti, Joe Nemechek, Ernie Irvan
and Jeff Burton were some of the Winston Cup drivers there.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, Adam's famous grandfather, was without his
trademark cowboy hat. Walking slowly behind the entourage of more
than 100 cousins and relatives was Bobby Allison, who lost two
sons, NASCAR drivers Davey and Clifford, to premature deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was killed while doing what he loved best _
racing,'' said Adam's 14-year old sister, Montgomery Lee. She and
Doug Carty, a retired minister and long-time friend of the Petty
family, were the only two to speak during the 45-minute service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're gone,'' she said, choking on tears. ``You won't be
here when I graduate. You won't be here when I marry. You won't be
here when I have my first-born, which will definitely have your
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Petty, 18, has shared the same bedroom since birth with
his older brother. In a letter read by Carty, Austin praised Adam
for being a Christian role model and positive influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam and I were so alike. ... Adam was just a little taller
and skinnier,'' the letter read. ``Even though it looked like I was
always mad when people mistaked me for him and asked for an
autograph, it didn't really bother me. . . . I know in my mind Adam
is in Heaven. He is in a better place right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pettys were the first family to have four generations drive
on the NASCAR circuit. Great-grandfather Lee Petty, who died on
April 5 at the age of 86, was one of the sport's first stars.
Richard Petty retired as the all-time leader in Winston Cup
victories with 200. Kyle, who has had a solid career, always had
other interests, including grooming his son's racing career.
</P>
<P>
   By spending so much time together at the race shop and track,
Kyle and Adam became almost inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle told me last night, `Isn't it wonderful how father and
son were best friends?''' Carty said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's lifelong dream was to race against his father in Winston
Cup. Adam qualified for his first event on the major league circuit
at Texas Motor Speedway in April, but Kyle did not make the field.
Kyle entered the race late as a replacement driver, but it was 13
laps after Adam had dropped out because of a blown engine.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were going to try it again in two weeks at the
Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte.

   Instead of being on the bench, he has been kicked upstairs,
literally. His only contributions are to act as an eye in the sky
and send notes down to interim coach Craig Ramsey about possible
adjustments to be made between periods. Neilson doesn't go to the
dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little strange,'' the coach concedes, the pain evident
on his weathered face despite a faint smile. ``But I'm trying to
make the best of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to treat a cancer patient?
</P>
<P>
   In December, the 65-year-old Neilson was diagnosed with multiple
myeloma, a malignant cancer that strikes plasma cells. He continued
to coach through two months of chemotherapy, but he finally had to
leave the team to undergo a stem-cell transplant on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Losing last shot at Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   Neilson says he was promised he could return as coach when he
recovered. He knew this would be his best _ and probably last _
chance to lead a team to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Neilson did not get his job back for the first round of the
playoffs. Then, before the Flyers played Pittsburgh in the second
round, Neilson's hopes were dashed for good. General manger Bobby
Clarke met with Neilson and told him that he would not be returning
to the bench at all for the playoffs. Ramsey, the interim coach,
would lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said it was because Neilson was not healthy enough to
withstand the rigors of coaching. Many people thought Neilson was
being pushed aside because Ramsey had led the Flyers to a 16-8-1
record to close the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointed Neilson lashed out on a radio talk show in
Canada. ``I don't think they want a cancer patient who's a friend
of (former captain) Eric Lindros behind the bench right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Contract is up
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Neilson tempered his words. ``I felt I was the coach
of the team, and if I was ready to coach, I should be coaching,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the possibility of returning to his team that pushed
Neilson through the grueling cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I erred on the side of encouraging Roger too much, I'm
guilty,'' Dr. Isadore Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said, ``The scary thing is, Roger almost put coaching
ahead of his health. People always say health is the most important
thing. In this case, it's been like, `To heck with my health, I
want to coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how well Neilson recovers, it is assumed in
Philadelphia that Ramsey will remain as coach next season.
Neilson's contract is up. In April, he told reporters that he and
Clarke had agreed in principle to a two-year extension. Clarke
denied any agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson knows what can happen when a team gets hot for an
interim coach. He took over at Vancouver when Harry Neale was given
a 10-game suspension late in the 1981-82 season, and Neale didn't
get the job back. Neilson led the Canucks to the Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, 49, played for Neilson in junior hockey and with the
Buffalo Sabres. He was an assistant under him at Florida before
joining the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tough situation for Ramsey
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey is in a no-win situation, which has nothing to do with
the Flyers being down 1-0 to New Jersey going into Game 2 tonight
in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tremendous amount of respect for Roger,'' he said.
``But when I took over, it had to be my team. I have to coach that
way. There's no other way to do it. It can't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said from Day 1, Roger and I are similar but we are not
the same, and there would be subtle differences. I've never
thought, `What would Roger do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson said about Ramsey, ``He's a guy who doesn't get
flustered, and that gives the team an air of confidence. I think
he's the kind of coach players like playing for because he doesn't
panic and he doesn't get overtly excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Neilson, Ramsey has had to battle a serious health crisis.
In 1993, Ramsey found out he had peptic-ulcer disease, and doctors
had to remove his stomach to save his life. Ramsey's small
intestine now is connected directly to his esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson stood by Ramsey then. Ramsey says he wants to be there
for Neilson now. They were angered last week when a columnist said
that they no longer were speaking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they get these things, I don't know,'' Neilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To just make up a story out of the blue, just because you feel
like it, is completely irresponsible,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson showed up at practice Friday and put on skates for the
first time in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be feeling better, can do a little more,'' rookie
goalie Brian Boucher said. ``We want to see him around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see him out there,'' defenseman Chris Therien
said. ``He joked that he hasn't lost a step. Everybody in this room
loves Roger, and it's great to have him around.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Flyers play the Devils tonight, Neilson won't be on
the bench or in the dressing room. He will be looking down from
above.

 &HT;    Jury selection starts for Ray Lewis trial
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL star Ray Lewis spent his 25th birthday Monday with a
courtroom full of Fulton County residents, some of whom will hold
his fate in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection in the high-profile murder trial started with
Superior Court Judge Alice Bonner excusing more than a third of the
jury pool. The remaining 89 potential jurors then answered general
questions from defense lawyers and prosecutors in a process that is
expected to last the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he will help
prosecute the case, the first time he has done so since taking over
the office more than three years ago. Also, Howard's team during
the weekend secured the testimony of Rehana Grant, one of the women
riding with Lewis in his rented limousine the night of the
killings. Grant has been given immunity in exchange for her
testimony, according to her lawyer, Cynthia Roseberry. Grant is the
third person in the limo to get immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Two large jury pools filled four benches throughout the
questioning. Lewis, dressed in a conservative double-breasted suit,
glanced up infrequently and rarely made eye contact with the
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and his friends Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting are
charged in the Jan. 31 stabbing deaths of Decatur residents Richard
Lollar and Jacinth Baker. The killings occurred in a fight on a
Buckhead street hours after the Super Bowl at the Georgia Dome.
Lewis' lead attorney, Ed Garland, asked jurors if a stranger had
ever picked a fight with them, if they were ever mugged or if they
had ever feared for their life.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's attorneys, Steve Sadow and John Bergendahl, asked
jury pool members how many had ever had to defend themselves.
Thirty-one raised their hands. They also asked the jury pool if
anyone had used a weapon in self-defense. Five had.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, they asked if anyone had ever been shot at. Lewis'
limo was hit by five gunshots as it sped away. No one raised their
hand. Bruce Harvey said his client, Oakley, was struck over the
head with a champagne bottle during the fight. Harvey then asked if
anyone ever saw a bottle used as a weapon. Seventeen had.
</P>
<P>
   Also, forensic DNA expert Henry Lee, who impressed jurors while
working for O.J. Simpson's defense team, is now listed as a
prosecution witness.

 &HT;    The big Preakness favorites
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months before he won the Florida Derby, Hal's Hope finished
first in the Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park at odds of 40-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida-bred owned and trained by Harold Rose may be back in
the same category when the last bet is made on Saturday for the
Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest still runs high in the colt's 88-year-old trainer. But
Hal's Hope, the star of the Florida winter season, has fallen to
the back of the pack in the betting favorites for the second event
of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Last in the Blue Grass Stakes and the 16th horse to reach the
finish line in the Kentucky Derby, Hal's Hope is listed at 40-1 for
the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In the early betting line supplied by Las Vegas Sports
Consultants, Fusaichi Pegasus, the Kentucky Derby champion on May
6, is a 1-2 betting favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The final line will be determined by the bets on race day.
</P>
<P>
   A maximum of eight starters are expected for the Preakness, not
a supririse considering the one-sided nature of the finish of
Fusaichi Pegasus at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Odds on the other six starters: Red Bullet 5-1, High Yield 7-1,
Imeachment 10-1, Captain Steve 10-1, Snuck In 10-1 and Hugh Hefner
75-1.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer John Kimmel announced Monday that Wheelaway, the Tampa
Bay Derby champion and fifth in the Kentucky Derby, will not enter
the Preakness. ``We'll get the horse ready for the Belmont
Stakes,'' said Kimmel, who is based at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Todd Pletcher, who entered four horses in the Kentucky
Derby, may start just one in Baltimore. More Than Ready is unlikely
to run, but Impeachment, third in the Derby, is a probable
Preakness starter.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet, Hal's Hope and High Yield, trained by Wayne Lukas,
are at Pimlico. Fusaichi Pegasus, Captain Steve, Snuck In are to be
flown in Wednesday from Louisville. Pletcher's horses are at his
Belmont barn. Hugh Hefner, to be ridden by Victor Espinoza, is
scheduled to come in by plane from California late in the week.

MERRILL LYNCH SETTLES CHARGES IN ROGUE BROKER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Richard F. Greene was more than Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s
biggest broker. He was part legend in Boston, where clients liked
to drop his name and everybody knew him downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But he could cost Merrill more than $30 million in the coming
months, as the Wall Street giant settles charges with Massachusetts
securities regulators that it failed to properly oversee the
retired broker and his risky investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's is the fourth recent case where the firm allegedly lost
control of its brokers in this region, including one fraud charge
and two instances of improper trading. Merrill calls these isolated
incidents, but regulators worry that even the most venerable firms
in the business are failing to detect _ and are perhaps overlooking
_ rogue behavior by brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making sure companies adhere to their own codes of
conduct and they sufficiently supervise their brokers,'' Secretary
of State William F. Galvin said. With a big firm like Merrill, he
added, ``The reliability of a brand name is really what's at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the biggest broker on Wall Street and not a
hard-sell factory of the ``Boiler Room'' movie variety. But the
state has spent the better part of the past year investigating
Merrill Lynch here.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill admitted no wrongdoing in the Greene case. But it has
agreed to pay $750,000, the biggest fine ever handed down by the
state securities division, and to negotiate payments with Greene's
clients, who claim to have lost more than $50 million on four
stocks he was pushing in the final stretch of his 38-year tenure
with Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   The fine and settlement also cover the misdeeds of Donald J.
Martineau, a longtime Boston broker who pleaded guilty to federal
fraud charges in February. He stole $9 million from clients between
1989 and 1998 to fund his options-trading account, telling them the
money was being placed in a real estate investment that didn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Other Merrill problems include John E. David, a former
Manchester, N.H., broker, who is being sued by customers who say
they lost $4.4 million from 1994 to 1997 on stocks he misled them
into buying. And there's also Donald C. Sarin, a Pittsfield broker
who traded his client's account heavily after she died in 1997, to
earn commissions for himself. His trades cost the victim's heirs
nearly $1 million; Merrill settled with them for about half that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Both brokers have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   What the four cases have in common is a lack of supervision,
regulators charge. Paul Fehrenbach, manager of the Boston office,
and his deputy, Kevin Chase, had responsibility for Greene,
Martineau, and the New Hampshire office. Sarin should have been
supervised by a manager in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, securities division chief Matthew Nestor said,
compliance officials in the regions and in New York should have
caught on to the schemes. The state has ordered Merrill to hire a
consultant within 30 days to review its compliance policies in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill insists Greene's is an entirely different case from
those of the other three brokers, whom the firm fired when it
learned of their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Bill Halldin calls Greene's a ``distinguished career''
as a financial consultant, ``helping countless clients
significantly increase the value of their investments and providing
excellent service.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene had five assistants, a stunning roster of 1,400 wealthy
clients, and $1.5 billion of their money under his watch. He made
big profits for people over the years, often betting large sums of
money on a few stocks a time. And he became a very rich man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Customers say service with Greene was about hot stock picks.
Many people say they never talked to him for more than 30 seconds
at a time. Typically, one of his assistants would call to reach a
customer. They'd wait on hold, then Greene would come on, ask if a
buy order was OK, and hang up when the customer said yes.
</P>
<P>
   To say ``no'' was not typical if you wanted to do business with
Dick Greene, customers and regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Greene's sudden and quiet retirement at age 65, in
December 1998, that took clients by surprise and perhaps sparked
the outrage over losses in accounts with huge concentrations in
four stocks: Indymac Mortgage Holdings Inc., Genesis Health
Ventures Inc., Orbital Sciences Corp., and Eldertrust Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Greene didn't tell clients he was retiring to Arizona. He didn't
send out letters. Nor did the firm. Instead, longtime clients
learned the news when they received calls from the new brokers
assigned to their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Halldin, the Merrill spokesman, said problems with four brokers
out of 250 in the region is a small number. ``In any large
organization, you're going to have employees who violate
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Halldin added, ``We take the enforcement of our
policies and procedures very seriously and continuously take new
steps to enhance our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, Merrill must pay an
additional $100,000 to cover the cost of the state's investigation.
And it has agreed to mediations with Greene clients who had more
than half the assets of their Merrill accounts in the four losing
stocks that Greene recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Michals, a Boston lawyer representing more than 20 of
Greene's former clients, said, ``We remain hopeful that the
mediation process will address our clients' concerns. But to be
successful, mediation requires a good-faith effort from all
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch must bear the cost of the mediations, which could
run $3,000 to $5,000 per one-day session. Customers must request a
mediation, in a letter to Merrill, within six months. The division
will pick the mediator. Anyone not satisfied with the amounts
offered by Merrill in those meetings can take his or her case to
normal arbitration, before a panel of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which regulates the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Halldin said 60 customers have complained about Greene's
investment picks for them since he retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look seriously at any concern that anyone raises in
the overall picture of their financial portfolios,'' he said.

WALL ST. JITTERS RISE BEFORE FED RATES DO ON INFLATION CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Federal Reserve policy makers meet Tuesday,
investors are wondering more about what comes next than by how much
the central bank will raise its short-term interest rate target
when it announces its decision early in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is forecasting an increase of half a percentage
point in the central bank's federal funds target rate on overnight
loans, raising that target to 6.5 percent. Until recently, most
analysts had expected a quarter-point move, matching the five
increases the Fed has made since June.
</P>
<P>
   But, more importantly, most analysts think that the Fed will
have to move well above 6.5 percent, perhaps this summer, before
economic growth is curbed and new inflationary pressures are
contained. And if inflation data worsens _ as some signs now
indicate _ the outlook may shift to even higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``are going to see the decision, then immediately
thoughts will jump ahead,'' said Ethan Harris, senior economist at
Lehman Bros. ``How much more do we have to go?''
</P>
<P>
   What all this means for the stock market, however, is hard to
predict, both immediately and in the near term. Monday, equity and
bond investors did not seem concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.41 points, or 1.9
percent, to 10,807.78, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed
78.59 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,607.65. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index jumped 31.40 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,452.36.
But all three indexes are below where they were when the new,
disturbing data on inflation began appearing April 27.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices rose as yields, which move in the
opposite direction, fell. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32,
to 100 14/32, with its yield falling to 6.44 percent Monday, from
6.51 percent on Friday. The yield remains well above the 6.13
percent on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Fed's rate increase and the outlook statement it
will issue Tuesday with the announcement could have a crucial
bearing on the markets. The April report on consumer prices, which
is expected to be released this morning ahead of the Fed meeting,
could also have a major impact.
</P>
<P>
   If the Consumer Price Index's monthly increase, especially in
the core inflation rate that excludes food and energy, is
surprisingly big, as it was in March, both the bond and stock
markets could have sell-offs. With such a surprise, investors would
immediately speculate that interest rates would have to move much
higher this year, no matter how aggressive the Fed is Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts are forecasting a tame CPI, with the core rate
up 0.2 percent and the overall rate flat or up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the atmosphere on Wall Street has been almost
palpable over the last three weeks. In that time, new employment
figures have shown the economy still to be growing briskly, and new
data on prices and wage-and-benefit costs have signaled that
inflationary pressures are building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got this overpowering private sector demand in conjunction
with some real inflation sparks,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, chief
U.S. economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``This is not a false
alarm,'' he said of the data pointing to higherinflation rates.
</P>
<P>
   The new data forced him to raise his forecast for the Fed's
short-term interest rate target to 7.5 percent by the end of the
year, from 6.75 percent. Harris of Lehman said his firm's forecast
was now for a Fed funds target of 7.25 percent by August, up from
6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Various indicators of investor sentiment on the Fed also show
expectations that rates will move much higher than thought just a
few weeks ago. For example, on April 24, the federal funds futures
contract for September indicated that investors expected an average
rate of 6.45 percent for September. That average for September has
now jumped to 6.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said ``it will be hard to find a silver lining'' in
Tuesday's Fed action if, as he expects, the Fed does raise its
target by half a percentage point and signals that inflation is
still a concern, meaning that more rate increases are in the
offing. While Lehman is in the minority, he said there is better
than a 50 percent chance the Fed will raise its target another half
a percentage point when policymakers meet in the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   What might soothe the markets some, he said, is the expected
increase of half a percentage point and a neutral statement that
investors could interpret to mean that Fed policymakers do not
think rates have to be pushed much higher. In 1994, the Fed made
two increases of half a percentage point each in its interest rate
target that came with such neutral outlook statements. Both the
bond and stock markets rallied. But Harris does not expect such a
soothing statement this time and in 1994 the Fed ended up pushing
rates much higher, despite the reassuring statements.
</P>
<P>
   DiClemente said that a surprisingly big increase in the core
rate of the Consumer Price Index, just a quarter-point rate
increase in the Fed's interest rate target or a soothing statement
from the Fed about the outlook for inflation could end up troubling
investors in the longer term. In all cases, he said it would be
possible for investors to begin to worry that the Fed was not
acting aggressively enough to curb inflation by slowing economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   If that opinion begins to influence investors, he said, two bad
things could happen: First, investors would believe the Fed would
have to make bigger-than-expected rate increases later to regain
the offensive against inflation. More importantly, the threat of
larger rate increases and being behind in the fight to curb
inflation would make investors fear a ``hard landing'' for the
economy. That is Wall Street jargon for the threat of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But DiClemente said if the Fed raised its interest rate target
half a percentage point and if the core CPI figure rose just 0.2
percent, then these might be comforting because investors would not
conclude that the Fed was losing the battle. That is what he is
predicting.

   The Boll Weevils are up 3-0 on the Lookouts in the top of the

pitch, and the umpire calls ball two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good eye, good eye,'' Hamilton Jordan shouts, hands cupped to
his mouth. ``Find one you like.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the language of the sandlots, of childhood, of eternal
springtimes when someone will lose a game but life lasts forever.
</P>
<P>
   The players on the field at Frankie Allen Park are 8 and 9 years
old. If most know who the president of the United States is, few
could tell you much about the Iranian hostage crisis, the energy
crisis or crises of any kind. The world they know is Buckhead and
adjacent enclaves, all green with prosperity and promise.
</P>
<P>
   But many know that the man coaching first base for the Boll
Weevils _ as a woman in the stands told the boy beside her _ once
``worked for President Carter. It was before you were born.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after what he dismisses as his ``15 minutes of
fame,'' Hamilton Jordan is used to being identified as who he once
was. At the Randolph School in Huntsville, Ala., where he went
recently to give a talk about his experiences with cancer, a
handsome brochure bears the words ``Hamilton Jordan, Former White
House Chief of Staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Titles come and go, and White House chiefs of staff can exit
faster than they entered. But Jordan, at 55, would have you believe
he has larger fish to fry than congressmen and Cabinet secretaries
wanting 15 minutes with the president of the United States, not to
mention the door-pounding Washington media. If the president is the
most powerful man in the world, his chief of staff might be second:
He is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office, trusted adviser and
guardian of secrets.
</P>
<P>
   It is a harder job than coaching first base, but all jobs have
their challenges, and some, it turns out, are closer to the marrow
of life than one might have thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got your mitt?'' he asks as 8-year-old Alex Jordan straps on
the catcher's gear between innings. The chest protector is on, the
shin guards are on and the mitt is in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, go get 'em, son,'' the catcher's dad says.
</P>
<P>
   He has the purposeful stride of a football coach _ muscular
legs, broad beam, white athletic socks snug against his calves.
Soccer moms aren't taken as seriously as baseball dads, but nobody
said life was fair.
</P>
<P>
   When power fades
</P>
<P>
   Three times since 1985 Hamilton Jordan has listened as doctors
told him he had cancer _ first lymphoma, then melanoma, then
prostate cancer. Each time he chose aggressive treatment, and each
time he dodged a malignant bullet. And then, a few years ago,
Jordan and his wife, Dorothy, learned that daughter Kathleen,
second of their three children, had juvenile diabetes and would
need daily insulin injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, sooner or later, are going to get a bad report,''
Jordan says, but he doesn't believe in waiting by the phone. He
paraphrases a line in a Bonnie Raitt song he likes: ``Life gets
more precious when there's less of it to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``No Such Thing as a Bad Day'' (Longstreet
Press, $22), the architect of Jimmy Carter's improbable nomination
for the presidency tells how quickly power and position fade to
irrelevance and how one's sense of proportion can change between
his 30s and his 50s. The pundits of the Sunday talk shows may be
pains in the butt, but they are not pathologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' his old sidekick Jody Powell says by phone from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them are oldies-but-goodies from the 1970s, like the
Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. Powell was Carter's dry-witted press
secretary _ the best ever to have held the job, some think. Jordan
was the crafty rube who picked up a reputation for enjoying himself
too much in Georgetown bars and not returning calls. For members of
Congress put off by a brash outsider, there was also the matter of
getting used to the name. Barbara Jordan they knew, and the king of
Jordan. But this was Hamilton ``Jerdun,'' as Southern as sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, never quite got the hang
of it and on occasion called him Hannibal Jerkin.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made for good copy (``They say he was something of a
rogue in his day,'' a young man in his 20s admiringly tells a
friend minutes before Jordan's recent talk in Huntsville). He
showed up for White House press briefings in tennis clothes, once
called Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser,
``Woody Woodpecker'' because of his spiky hair, and was accused of
appreciating too openly the bosom of the Egyptian ambassador's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the baseless rumor that Jordan had used
cocaine at Studio 54 in New York. After an investigation, a federal
grand jury voted 24-0 against bringing an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be alive
</P>
<P>
   It was all a long time ago. Powell's voice hasn't changed in 20
years, but he wants to tell you about his three grandchildren. Tip
O'Neill is dead and Jordan is happy just to be alive. His laugh is
a rich cackle, usually directed at himself. ``Hi darlin','' he says
into the car phone. His wife is telling him something that amuses
him, and to a person of a certain age he sounds a little like the
Big Bopper.
</P>
<P>
   They hang up and Jordan resumes a story about himself and Powell
in their salad days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told Jody once he was the best White Press spokesman
in modern times, and Jody says, `If I was so good, then why did we
get such crappy press?'''
</P>
<P>
   He can indulge a rueful laugh on Powell's behalf, but still _
more than 20 years later _ goes out of his way to explain why it
wasn't his job to return calls that long ago lost their urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be 5 o'clock and you'd find there were 50 people you were
supposed to call,'' he says from the wheel of a 1990 Lexus that he
admits hasn't been cleaned in a while. ``All of them think they're
the only one. And some of 'em I wasn't the person they needed to
talk to. Jody dealt with the press, Frank Moore dealt with the
Congress. But people started saying I didn't return calls, and
pretty soon the label stuck. No, I don't miss it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop him from running, unsuccessfully, for the U.S.
Senate in 1986, but even that was three jobs back. He worked for
Whittle Communications in Knoxville for two years and was executive
director of the Association of Tennis Professionals for three
years. Today Jordan has a hand in a number of start-up companies,
many focusing on health, education and the media. In 1982 _ two
years before he learned he had cancer _ he and his wife founded
Camp Sunshine, a program for children with cancer or leukemia, and
they have begun a camp for children with juvenile diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably get 10 to 15 calls a week from people I don't know
who have cancer,'' he says. He has become an advocate, urging
people to educate themselves, act boldly and seek the best
treatment they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to forget the raw fear of death,'' he says.
``Today I lead a life I don't take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan came to prominence as a shrewd political infighter,
someone who, his own mother once said, had been ``a political
animal'' since childhood. ``If he didn't run himself, he'd run his
cousin,'' she told Kandy Stroud, author of the 1977 book ``How
Jimmy Won.''
</P>
<P>
   But politics doesn't enter Jordan's conversation much these
days. He is informed, but willing to let others do the analyzing.
``As I've gotten older,'' he says, ``I've gotten more conservative,
more cynical about what government can and cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's lost interest in politics,'' says Powell.
``My sense of it is that it has more to do with the change in the
political process over the years _ how much more nasty and partisan
politics has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Beck, who was in Jordan's Cub Scout troop in Albany and
worked in the White House during the Carter years, recalls how
public affairs shaped Hamilton's boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the kind of family that, when you went over and had
dinner, they talked about politics, books, the world,'' Beck says.
``Hamilton was always interested in politics. He took a year off
from going to the University of Georgia to work on Carter's
gubernatorial campaign in 1966. He always had this ability to
focus, but I think having cancer and having children have given him
even more. Every day means more now. He goes to every school play,
every soccer game, every baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   A winning day
</P>
<P>
   It is a Saturday afternoon, and the sun is high in the sky.
Baseball games are in progress throughout Frankie Allen Park.
Parents and children are encamped in bleachers, many in sunglasses.
At 1 o'clock the temperature is on its way toward 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Jordan is the only man in sight wearing long sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two outs, guys _ run on anything,'' Jordan barks from first
base. He's good on the fundamentals, as baseball buffs like to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Boll Weevils would go on to win 10-0, the bags would be
packed and the players would trot off, knowing they would play
another day.
</P>
<P>
   As such games go, this one was easy, soon to be forgotten by
8-year-olds in the kaleidoscope of experience. It means more to
their coach than to the players. Into the sunshine he walks off _
wife and daughter on one side, son on the other _ like a man happy
to have taken it into extra innings.

 &HT;    Disposable hearing aid a boon to boomers
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's first disposable hearing aid might become the newest
rite of passage for hard-living baby boomers who have already
snapped up such products as disposable contact lenses, seamless bi-
and trifocals, Rogaine for hair loss and Viagra for impotence.
</P>
<P>
   For about a $2 a day, people with mild to moderate hearing loss
can try out a pair of ``Songbird'' disposable hearing aids, which
are designed to last about five weeks. The new devices will be
available in more than a dozen cities nationally this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very excited about this,'' said Helena Solodar, a
partner of Audiological Consultants of Atlanta, which will be
offering the devices. ``I think this product is going to
dramatically change how people view hearing aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 28 million Americans suffer from hearing
loss, fewer than one-fifth of them use a hearing aid, according to
Frederick Fritz, Songbird Medical's chief executive officer. That's
mostly because of the cost, which ranges from $900 to $3,000, and
to hearing aids' negative image.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're seen as a hassle to buy and a hassle to use,'' Fritz
said. ``And boomers see hearing aids as something for old and
disabled people.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, increasingly, boomers _ an estimated 5 million of whom
are experiencing serious hearing loss _ need such devices. ``It
used to be that the average age in our waiting room was 75 years
old,'' said Solodar. ``Now it's dropped down to about 60 years old,
with a lot more patients in their 40s and 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Songbird is aiming squarely at those younger patients. Even its
marketing pitch is different from its forerunners'. Whereas ads for
most hearing aids have concentrated on better technology, the
Songbird is hitting on two key points: affordability through
disposability and lifestyle vs. age. The company is trying to
convince people that hearing aids are no longer just for old
fogeys, but for people who live life loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will become a badge of honor,'' Fritz said.
``But certainly we will be pushing the idea that noise pollution,
and not necessarily age, is the cause of your hearing loss.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million Americans have permanent, irreversible
hearing loss from noise or trauma, according to the National
Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, part of
the National Institutes of Health. And more than 30 million people
are exposed to injurious levels of noise daily in the workplace. In
fact, noise-induced hearing loss is the most common occupational
ailment and the second most common self-reported injury, according
to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing our hearing at a younger age,'' said Marin
Allen, spokeswoman for the National Institute on Deafness. ``We're
living in a noisier, louder environment. Certainly, grandmother
didn't have hair dryers, blenders and leaf blowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or loud music, whether it be rock or opera. And the music _
paired with louder industrial equipment _ may account for one major
difference between baby boomers and previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, men and women reported losing their hearing at
about the same rate. Now, twice as many male as female boomers
report hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Songbird designed its one-size-fits-all hearing
aid to fit primarily men's slightly larger ear canal.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Songbird, which took four years to develop, is
disposable, scientists changed the design from conventional aids in
other ways. Because it doesn't need space for a replaceable
battery, it uses a microphone seven times larger than those of most
designs. It also has a soft silicone tip that can be molded deeply
into the ear canal, which would not be feasible if the aid had to
last longer than 40 days. It is not designed to be taken in and
out, and a prescription is written for one of the pre-programmed
acoustic levels so a wearer doesn't have to make frequent volume
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom-line cost of the Songbird is not significantly
lower than permanent hearing aids. A typical user would have to buy
two Songbirds approximately once a month, at an out-of-pocket
expense of about $80 a month, which puts it in the same range as a
$1,500 hearing aid that lasts a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Songbird could prove useful for those who want to
experiment or merely use it for special occasions, such as a family
reunion or an important business meeting, Solodar said. And, though
hearing researchers won't predict how well Songbird _ four years in
development _ will fly in the marketplace, they say it could help
more people get up the nerve to at least try hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   On average, patients wait eight to 10 years from the moment they
suspect they have hearing loss to the point where they seek a
hearing aid consultation, Solodar said. But if the cost and stigma
of hearing aids are greatly reduced, more people may seek help
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait too long to get the assistance _ they've got too
much permanent damage,'' Allen said. ``This might encourage more
people to at least get their hearing tested.''

 &HT;    Black actors land new roles on NBC
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The face of network television may be changing this
fall. NBC has several African-Americans featured in its seven new
fall shows, including David Alan Grier in ``DAG,'' a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know got a deal,'' Grier said Monday, referring to
black actors who were in demand during this spring's pilot season.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's TV season was famous for its dearth of
African-Americans on new shows, and the subsequent threats of
boycotts and meetings between the networks and the NAACP and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said the networks were paying attention to minority
casting as a direct result of the furor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if it'll help me, I'll be out tomorrow with Al
Sharpton,'' he joked at an NBC party following the network's
presentation to advertisers, the first in a weeklong series known
as the ``upfronts'' (because the advertisers then buy spots up
front, before the season starts).
</P>
<P>
   In ``DAG,'' Grier plays Jerome Daggett, a Secret Service agent
who is assigned to the B team covering the first lady (Delta Burke
of ``Designing Women''). Another African-American, Mel Jackson,
plays a fellow agent and appeared prominently in the clips shown to
advertisers. ``DAG'' will air at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Steven Weber Show,'' an ensemble comedy about a man who
is hexed by a former blind date, Weber's boss is Wendell Pierce, a
black actor from ``Third Watch.'' The show will air at 8:30 p.m.
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   Richards still Kramer-esque
</P>
<P>
   NBC's biggest ``new'' star may have his work cut out for him.
``The Michael Richards Show,'' starring the once-and-future Kramer
from ``Seinfeld,'' was described by NBC Entertainment President
Garth Ancier as ``a quirky physical comedy'' in which Richards
plays ``a modern-day Inspector Clouseau.'' At NBC's presentation at
the Metropolitan Opera House, Richards made an elaborate,
prat-falling entrance from the audience to the stage, knocking over
a camerman and dismantling a microphone. But when a five-minute
clip was shown of Richards as a private detective driving over
flowerbeds there was virtually no laughter in the audience of ad
agency buyers and affiliate managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richards'' is scheduled to air at 8 p.m. Tuesdays. Don't be
surprised if there is talk of ``retooling'' along the way,
network-speak for ``it didn't work the first time, so we're
completely redoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter in all the wrong places
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous, there was plenty of laughter during the clips
for ``Titans,'' an unabashedly steamy soap opera from Aaron
Spelling that will air at 8 p.m. Wednesdays, the time slot
Spelling's ``Beverly Hills 90210'' will vacate after Wednesday's
finale. Ancier called the show ``a total guilty pleasure,'' and the
clips were heavy on rich people having extramarital sex. Yasmine
Bleeth, Casper Van Dien and Victoria Principal are among the stars.
</P>
<P>
   `Today' goes to three hours
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show will expand to three hours from two starting
in September, running from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., NBC News announced.
The existing ``Later Today'' will air at 10 a.m. in 13 cities with
NBC owned-and-operated stations. Atlanta is not among these.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' co-anchors Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, as well as
news anchor Ann Curry and weatherman Al Roker, will participate in
the third hour, which will be formatted similarly to the second
hour of the existing program.
</P>
<P>
   Also new from NBC
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Tucker,'' a comedy about a 15-year-old boy (Eli Marienthal)
who is forced to live with his aunt (Katey Sagal of ``Married ...
With Children''). It will air at 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ed,'' a comedy-drama about a nice-guy lawyer (Tom Cavanagh)
fired from his high-income job, who moves back to his small town,
buys a bowling alley and tries to woo his high-school crush. It
will air at 8 p.m. Sundays, a difficult time slot competing against
``The Simpsons'' and ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Deadline,'' a drama created by Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP; Order'').
Oliver Platt stars as a newspaper columnist who uses college
students to help him investigate crimes. It's set for 9 p.m.
Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finally, theatrical movies will air from 8 to 11 p.m. Saturday
nights, but with a twist. Online viewers will be able to play
trivia quizzes based on the movie and the ads being shown and
compete to win $100,000. The movies will disappear in February and
be replaced by ``XFL,'' the new rougher-edged pro football league
in which NBC is a participant. No fair-catch rule in this league,
the network says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big events, as always, will air Sunday nights. That's when
NBC will start ``A Man in Full,'' its four-hour adaptation of Tom
Wolfe's best seller set in Atlanta (still no word on casting);
``Unforgettable: The Natalie Cole Story''; and ``Jackie Ethel Joan:
The Women of Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   What's missing? ``Jesse,'' ``Stark Raving Mad,'' ``The
Pretender,'' ``Profiler,'' ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Suddenly
Susan'' are among the shows NBC killed off.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable? When NBC moves ``Just Shoot Me'' to 9:30 p.m.
Thursdays, it will mark the first time in years the network hasn't
tried to launch a series at 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Next fall, only
``The Steven Weber Show'' will be new on Thursdays; ``Friends,''
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``ER'' will all be
returning.
</P>
<P>
   And what do the advertisers think? After all, Monday's
production was aimed at them. They're cautious at this point, and
don't want to commit much opinion _ let alone money _ until they've
seen full episodes rather than just clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no huge break-out hits on the surface, but we have
to see the shows. Right now it's just elements of the shows,'' said
Jennifer Leavens, manager of the national broadcast department for
Round Two Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Upfront presentations continue all week. WB and ABC are today,
CBS is Wednesday and UPN and Fox are Thursday.

 &HT;    Fall 2000: NBC woos advertisers
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC's money may be on the returning ``Friends,'' but
it was the cast of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' who got the big applause Monday
when NBC presented its fall 2000 schedule to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, the
network presented ``The NBC Upfront Operetta,'' with Eric
McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullaly of ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' pitching the network to the people who buy commercials.
``Our demographic is what you're looking for,'' they sang, ``the
big-spending hotties you adore.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``upfronts'' are an annual TV ritual, attended by
advertisers, affiliates and series stars. The purpose is to
persuade advertisers to spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's presentation was nearly overshadowed by the ``Friends''
contract negotiations. Word came Sunday that the six stars will
each get close to $40 million over the next two years from salary
and profit-sharing, and will be back at 8 p.m. Thursdays. The
contracts are for two 24-episode seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' will be followed at 9 p.m. Thursdays by ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' moving to NBC's most prestigious real estate. ``Frasier,''
which will move from Thursdays to 9 p.m. Tuesdays in the fall, took
a ratings hit this season from ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''

   ABC presents its fall schedule today, and there will be no
``Sports Night'' in its lineup. Creator Aaron Sorkin said Monday
that the network finally canceled it over the weekend. He said he's
still in talks with HBO about moving ``Sports Night'' there.

 &HT;    New magazines target shoppers, movie buffs
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new magazines hit the stands this week with distinctly
different audiences in mind. Published by Conde Nast, Lucky ($2.50)
is a glossy, 202-page bimonthly publication that's all about
shopping. Articles include a list of 700 great finds, 71 cool
stores, 39 must-visit Web sites, tips on buying a dog and a shoe
guide that would excite Imelda Marcos. ``Lucky is a magazine
created for _ and, of course, by _ enthusiastic, even obsessive
shoppers,'' says Editor in Chief Kim France. Shopping, she adds, is
all about realizing your fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is ifcRant ($2.95), a joint venture between the
Independent Film Channel and indieWire.com that's aimed at movie
buffs who are interested in more than what the big Hollywood
studios have to offer. The debut issue features articles on Ethan
Hawke (``Hamlet''), Billy Crudup (``Waking the Dead''), the latest
in independent films, and a May-June viewer's guide to the
Independent Film Channel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary storm: Two of the biggest book-related events of the
summer are the publication of J.K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter
novel and the release of ``A Perfect Storm,'' the George Clooney
movie based on Sebastian Junger's best-selling book about a
maritime tragedy. Book ($4.95) correspondent Helen Jerome talks
with Rowling about her success and offers a sneak preview of
``Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament,'' which is due in
stores July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Writer John Clark accompanies ``Perfect Storm'' author Junger to
Gloucester, Mass., where filmmakers were shooting scenes of the
town and its seafaring residents. ``They're not used to being
admired for fishing,'' Junger says. ``Suddenly, being a fisherman
is kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Uncivil union: Andrew Sullivan declaims in The New Republic
($3.50) that Vermont's new civil union status for gay couples is
``a pseudomarital institution'' that creates a two-tiered system
akin to laws that once prohibited sex between races. The freedom to
marry is a fundamental right accorded under the Constitution, he
says in an essay that disputes, point by point, the arguments
against gay marriage.

 &HT;    Spears does it again, and fans will be happy
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's not the Love Bug virus, but teen queen Britney Spears
today unleashes an electronic invasion of America.
</P>
<P>
   Her new album, ``Oops ... I Did It Again,'' the highly
anticipated follow-up to the kittenish smash ``... Baby One More
Time,'' is officially available and being hyped to the max _ in
stores, on MTV, in teenage chat rooms and through dozens of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the loud buzz, however, the record is nothing new.
Spears and her producers haven't stepped a pink-polished toenail
outside the ``baybee baybee'' formula that hypnotized little girls
(and plenty of older men) a year ago: a posturing, sexpot blend of
fat dance beats and Kewpie-doll groans. On most cuts, Spears might
as well be warbling, ``Baybee hit me two more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she stretch as a vocalist. The one-time Louisiana
schoolgirl relies heavily on an irritating faux-soul-sister speak
that's Foxy Brown after hostess training at the Magic Kingdom _ too
is ``tuh,'' you is ``yuh.'' Even on the emotional ballad ``Don't
Let Me Be the Last to Know,'' she sounds like she has a toy moo box
stuck in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   The main change here is that the 18-year-old pop star has grown
up lyrically, from the teasing parochial-school vamp of her early
videos to a femme fatale capable of a cocky kiss-off. ``I've had
enough, / I'm not your property,'' she growls on ``Stronger''
(cloned from the staccato hip-hop of She'kspere's ``Bills Bills
Bills''). In the album's one surprisingly creative moment, Spears
slows down the beat on a startlingly seductive cover of the Rolling
Stones' ``Satisfaction,'' changing the words to ``When I'm watching
my TV / and that girl comes on and tells me / how tight my skirts
should be, / she can't tell me / got my own identity.'' Not exactly
under Mick's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   While this CD proves that Spears is nothing more than a pop joy
ride, it has one redeeming quality that will sell millions and make
it the album of the summer: It's a lot of fun. Nearly every tune is
launched on the same blinking runway that lies under the Backstreet
Boys and 'N Sync, a funhouse mix of synthesizer blasts, loopy sound
effects and hooks you just can't get out of your head.
</P>
<P>
   As Leslie Gore did in the 1960s, Donna Summer in the '70s and
Madonna in the '80s, Spears has found a sound that works, and she's
sticking to it. And, like those Top 40 girlfriends, she's totally
plugged into the culture of her teenage fan base _ a pop smoothie
world of cell phone chatter, e-mail relationships, instant
messaging and dialing up ``Total Request Live.'' This is how well
she knows her audience: In between nearly each track here, there
are sound bites of Britney gabbing with friends.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath it all is the smoldering sexuality of young girls
trapped between pigtails and push-up bras. Spears giggles like a
teen in flannel pajamas but wears body-molding halter tops that
could be issued by an escort service. Eighth-graders buy her CDs;
dads watch the videos. It's a game as old as the genetic code
itself _ this one just happens to be stamped with a bar code.

IU: TALK ABOUT A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I watched this sitcom Monday about a really tight, really
dysfunctional family. I wish I could say it made me smile like
``Malcolm in the Middle'' does every week. But in truth all it did
was make me squirm.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana University family is so much more messed up than
Fox's the Wilkersons. That much was obvious during a news
conference carried live by a cable TV network in which Indiana
University President Myles Brand and two of the university's Board
of Trustees members prattled on about there being nothing more
important than ``protecting and enhancing the image'' of their
great university, that they take seriously their responsibilities
as the guardians of the university's reputation, that there are no
sacred cows at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and that Bob Knight will be back next year for his 30th
season as the Hoosiers' basketball coach, his laundry list of
``abusive and embarrassing behavior'' notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't see them talking out of both sides of their mouths,
I would have sworn Brand and the trustees were puppets, and that
somewhere out of the camera's range, hunched over in depraved
delight working the strings, was Knight.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to Brand and university trustee John Walda drone
on, two white-skinned, white-haired men defending their own, I felt
sorry for all the Hoosiers in the Middle of this sorry production.
</P>
<P>
   For too many years, Indiana University has been teaching its
student body one lesson above all others: That an authority figure
can profanely demand perfection from his subordinates but be
himself terribly flawed and it's OK as long as the authority figure
is a good ol' boy with a distinguished record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university could have done better in the past (policing
Knight),'' Brand was big enough to admit. ``The university will
rectify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand could have started by demanding Knight make an appearance
at his reprieve. Knight was caught by a television camera walking
on the Bloomington campus Monday afternoon, but he couldn't find
his way to the news conference in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than say himself how sorry he was for his disgraceful
behavior in the past and how he looks forward to being a kinder,
gentler coach and a more empathetic human being in the future,
Knight left it to Brand and Walda to say what is deep inside his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's absence from Monday's news conference spoke louder than
that 330-word statement he issued over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   If Knight is going to follow through on his promise to apologize
to those he has wronged, he should have wasted no time getting
started. So many (ital)mea culpas(end ital), you know, so little
time.
</P>
<P>
   Short of breaking bread with ex-player Neil Reed, there would
have been no better way for Knight to demonstrate he is a new man,
a changed man, than to have cut short his morning turkey shoot to
address the gathered media, too many of whom he has treated like
that stuff on the toilet paper he allegedly waved in his players'
faces during one of his inspired pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   But then, what do I know? I thought Knight ought to have been
fired after he brandished a bullwhip at his star African-American
forward Calbert Cheaney in Albuquerque during the 1992 NCAA
Tournament. I was there, and trust me, nobody I asked, including
the president of the local NAACP chapter, got the joke.
</P>
<P>
   I thought he should have been disciplined and denounced at least
as roundly as John Rocker would be a dozen years later for his
comments to broadcaster Connie Chung in 1988. By way of describing
his attitude toward stress, Knight said, ``I think that if rape is
inevitable, relax and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought for sure he'd be shoved off his pedestal in Indiana
when he berated a media liaison _ bullied him, badly _ in plain
view of the cameras after the Hoosiers went out meekly to Missouri
in the first round of the 1995 NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The thing I didn't realize about Indiana University until the
Neil Reed videotape surfaced in March is that its leaders are like
the parents of the preschooler who terrorizes every other child at
the neighborhood playground. He pulls the girls' hair, pushes the
boys to the ground and throws temper tantrums whenever he doesn't
get his way.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's mother sits on a bench a few feet away, pretending not
to notice her son's bad behavior, until one day another parent
videotapes the whole scene and shows it to the neighbors. The
mother, mortified that people are beginning to talk about what a
terrible parent she is, makes a grand public display of slapping
her son's hand at the playground one day, just to show everyone she
is a woman of authority and action.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe a child can modify years of bad behavior after a
single slap, then you probably are confident the 59-year-old Knight
will be able to shed his anger as easily as one of those hideous
plaid jackets he used to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us won't hold our breaths. &QL;

UNIVLEVER CHIEF PRESSES BESTFOODS ON TAKEOVER OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stepping up the pressure on a reluctant takeover target, the
co-chairman of Unilever said Monday that he thought the $66-a-share
offer made earlier this month for Bestfoods was ``serious money''
and that the company wants the management of Bestfoods to meet with
Unilever to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the prospect of the sale of Nabisco Group
Holdings to another food company, like Groupe Danone or Philip
Morris, intensified the focus on a Unilever-Bestfoods combination.
</P>
<P>
   Merging Nabisco with either Groupe Danone or Philip Morris would
create a global packaged-food giant that could leave Bestfoods
behind, one analyst said. ``Some powerhouses are being built,''
said the analyst, John R. McMillin of Prudential Securities.
``Where does that put Bestfoods?''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Antony Burgmans, the co-chairman of Unilever,
drew parallels between his company's pursuit of Bestfoods and its
recent successful acquisition of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade. ``We have
respect for the company with whom we are negotiating, respect for
the brands and respect for the work they have done,'' Burgmans
said. ``In the end, that is why we were able to convince Ben and
Jerry to sit at the table with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bestfoods, he added: ``What puzzles and amazes us is that
at that price, a premium of 34 percent over what the stock was
trading for, they haven't come up to talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bestfoods, at least publicly, is not budging from the
position it took earlier this month that the offer, worth $18.4
billion, is too low. ``Our board of directors firmly and
unanimously rejected Unilever's offer of $66 per share as
financially inadequate,'' said Gale Griffin, a company spokeswoman.
``Nothing has changed since then. The Unilever proposal was quite
clear. If they have further communications about value, they have
the ability to communicate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say they expect Unilever, which makes foods like
Breyer's ice cream and Lipton tea and household products like Dove
soap, to prevail. In a presentation at a conference hosted by
Goldman, Sachs Monday Unilever's other co-chairman, Niall
FitzGerald, also expressed bewilderment that Bestfoods executives
had not asked to meet to discuss the proposal. ``We fail to
understand why Bestfoods management will not engage in face-to-face
discussions,'' FitzGerald told the group, which Charles R.
Shoemate, the chairman and chief executive of Bestfoods, addressed
later in the day. ``Consolidation is inevitable in the food
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgmans said Unilever wanted to take over not just the
Bestfoods brands, which include Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups
and Skippy peanut butter, but also the management. ``We know this
management well,'' he said. ``Their people would have leading
responsibilities in the new structure.'' The president of
Unilever's North American food business, Richard Goldstein, is
leaving Unilever at the end of the month, and no successor has been
named.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger went through, Knorr would become Unilever's
biggest brand, FitzGerald told investors, and Hellmann's would be
the third or fourth largest. Adding huge brands like those would
speed up Unilever's disposal of smaller brands, making the strategy
that Unilever announced in February go into effect faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been preparing our business case for the last 12
months,'' FitzGerald said. ``We believe we can execute the
integration program with relatively low risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases where the two companies have overlapping
operations, Unilever's business would be folded into that of
Bestfoods, Burgmans said. ``They are very strong in food service
and we are weaker,'' he said. ``We would fold our food service unit
into theirs. In the U.S., we would become a powerhouse. In Latin
America, Unilever is strong but not in foods. They are not so
strong in Asia, but at a single stroke, we could have them in a
million shops.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillin said that Unilever's purchase of Ben &AMP; Jerry's for $326
million and Slim-Fast Food Cos. for $2.4 billion, both announced on
April 12, may have given Bestfoods the impression that Unilever had
done all its acquiring for the year. ``I think they were was
surprised to see Unilever bidding so quickly again,'' he said.
``They were breathing a sigh of relief, and then were caught by
surprise.''

 &HT;    Black actors land new roles on NBC
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The face of network television may be changing this
fall. NBC has several African-Americans featured in its seven new
fall shows, including David Alan Grier in ``DAG,'' a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know got a deal,'' Grier said Monday, referring to
black actors who were in demand during this spring's pilot season.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's TV season was famous for its dearth of
African-Americans on new shows, and the subsequent threats of
boycotts and meetings between the networks and the NAACP and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said the networks were paying attention to minority
casting as a direct result of the furor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if it'll help me, I'll be out tomorrow with Al
Sharpton,'' he joked at an NBC party following the network's
presentation to advertisers, the first in a weeklong series known
as the ``upfronts'' (because the advertisers then buy spots up
front, before the season starts).
</P>
<P>
   In ``DAG,'' Grier plays Jerome Daggett, a Secret Service agent
who is assigned to the B team covering the first lady (Delta Burke
of ``Designing Women''). Another African-American, Mel Jackson,
plays a fellow agent and appeared prominently in the clips shown to
advertisers. ``DAG'' will air at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Steven Weber Show,'' an ensemble comedy about a man who
is hexed by a former blind date, Weber's boss is Wendell Pierce, a
black actor from ``Third Watch.'' The show will air at 8:30 p.m.
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   Richards still Kramer-esque
</P>
<P>
   NBC's biggest ``new'' star may have his work cut out for him.
``The Michael Richards Show,'' starring the once-and-future Kramer
from ``Seinfeld,'' was described by NBC Entertainment President
Garth Ancier as ``a quirky physical comedy'' in which Richards
plays ``a modern-day Inspector Clouseau.'' At NBC's presentation at
the Metropolitan Opera House, Richards made an elaborate,
prat-falling entrance from the audience to the stage, knocking over
a camerman and dismantling a microphone. But when a five-minute
clip was shown of Richards as a private detective driving over
flowerbeds there was virtually no laughter in the audience of ad
agency buyers and affiliate managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richards'' is scheduled to air at 8 p.m. Tuesdays. Don't be
surprised if there is talk of ``retooling'' along the way,
network-speak for ``it didn't work the first time, so we're
completely redoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter in all the wrong places
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous, there was plenty of laughter during the clips
for ``Titans,'' an unabashedly steamy soap opera from Aaron
Spelling that will air at 8 p.m. Wednesdays, the time slot
Spelling's ``Beverly Hills 90210'' will vacate after Wednesday's
finale. Ancier called the show ``a total guilty pleasure,'' and the
clips were heavy on rich people having extramarital sex. Yasmine
Bleeth, Casper Van Dien and Victoria Principal are among the stars.
</P>
<P>
   `Today' goes to three hours
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show will expand to three hours from two starting
in September, running from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., NBC News announced.
The existing ``Later Today'' will air at 10 a.m. in 13 cities with
NBC owned-and-operated stations. Atlanta is not among these.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' co-anchors Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, as well as
news anchor Ann Curry and weatherman Al Roker, will participate in
the third hour, which will be formatted similarly to the second
hour of the existing program.
</P>
<P>
   Also new from NBC
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Tucker,'' a comedy about a 15-year-old boy (Eli Marienthal)
who is forced to live with his aunt (Katey Sagal of ``Married ...
With Children''). It will air at 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ed,'' a comedy-drama about a nice-guy lawyer (Tom Cavanagh)
fired from his high-income job, who moves back to his small town,
buys a bowling alley and tries to woo his high-school crush. It
will air at 8 p.m. Sundays, a difficult time slot competing against
``The Simpsons'' and ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Deadline,'' a drama created by Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP; Order'').
Oliver Platt stars as a newspaper columnist who uses college
students to help him investigate crimes. It's set for 9 p.m.
Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finally, theatrical movies will air from 8 to 11 p.m. Saturday
nights, but with a twist. Online viewers will be able to play
trivia quizzes based on the movie and the ads being shown and
compete to win $100,000. The movies will disappear in February and
be replaced by ``XFL,'' the new rougher-edged pro football league
in which NBC is a participant. No fair-catch rule in this league,
the network says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big events, as always, will air Sunday nights. That's when
NBC will start ``A Man in Full,'' its four-hour adaptation of Tom
Wolfe's best seller set in Atlanta (still no word on casting);
``Unforgettable: The Natalie Cole Story''; and ``Jackie Ethel Joan:
The Women of Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   What's missing? ``Jesse,'' ``Stark Raving Mad,'' ``The
Pretender,'' ``Profiler,'' ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Suddenly
Susan'' are among the shows NBC killed off.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable? When NBC moves ``Just Shoot Me'' to 9:30 p.m.
Thursdays, it will mark the first time in years the network hasn't
tried to launch a series at 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Next fall, only
``The Steven Weber Show'' will be new on Thursdays; ``Friends,''
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``ER'' will all be
returning.
</P>
<P>
   And what do the advertisers think? After all, Monday's
production was aimed at them. They're cautious at this point, and
don't want to commit much opinion _ let alone money _ until they've
seen full episodes rather than just clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no huge break-out hits on the surface, but we have
to see the shows. Right now it's just elements of the shows,'' said
Jennifer Leavens, manager of the national broadcast department for
Round Two Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Upfront presentations continue all week. WB and ABC are today,
CBS is Wednesday and UPN and Fox are Thursday.

   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. _ Casting the overhaul of the Social
Security system as a ``test of presidential candidates,'' Gov.
George W. Bush on Monday proposed to fundamentally change the
retirement system by allowing workers to choose how to invest some
of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   With his formal call for the introduction of individual
retirement accounts, Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, began a debate that could dominate the presidential
campaign. He and Vice President Al Gore differ sharply over how to
meet the fiscal challenge posed by the coming retirement of the
baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Social Security has long been considered the ``third
rail'' of politics, which a candidate touches at his peril, Bush
took a gamble that in the new economy, with nearly 50 percent of
American households now owning stock, his proposal would prove
appealing. Bush also embraced a bipartisan proposal for Medicare
that would reshape it by giving beneficiaries fixed amounts of
money to chose from a variety to health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and
me,'' Bush said Monday at an appearance at a senior citizen center
here. ``He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust
individual Americans. I trust Americans to make their own decisions
and manage their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later in Philadelphia, Gore came out squarely
against the plan, calling it dangerous for individual taxpayers and
for the economy overall. ``If we turn the Social Security system
into a system of winners and losers,'' he said, ``we will be
jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans and in the
end we will all have to pay to make up the differences.'' (Text of
both candidates' remarks is available from The New York Times on
the Web, www.nytimes.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The sharp debate comes at a time when demographic changes will
soon threaten the solvency of Social Security. Starting in 2015,
the retirement system will start paying out more in benefits than
it will collect in payroll taxes, because of the retirement of the
large baby boom generation. Under current projections, by 2037 it
will be able to pay out only 75 percent in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement
accounts would amount to the most far-reaching change in Social
Security since its inception during the Depression. As it has
worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll
taxes of current workers; under the Bush plan workers would be able
to hold on to a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for
their own retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued it would both provide an infusion of cash to make
the program solvent and give people ``the security of ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he largely skirted specifics in his speech, preferring
to talk about broad principles. It was unclear, for instance,
exactly how much money people could set aside for individual
accounts and what sort of investment options they would have. Bush
did say the investments would have to be in ``steady, reliable
funds,'' adding that ``there will will be no fly-by-night
speculators or day trading.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged that benefits would not change for current
retirees and ``near retirees.'' He said he would dedicate the
entire $2 trillion Social Security surplus to the retirement
program. He ruled out any increase in payroll taxes, but was silent
on whether to raise the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Texas Republican's address was devoted to drawing a
contrast between himself and the vice president, casting himself as
a leader who would pave the way for a bipartisan agreement on a
pressing policy matter. ``I am here with a message for America and
to put my opponent on notice,'' Bush said. ``The days of spreading
fear and panic are over. The days of delaying, dividing,
demagoguing are over. When I am elected this generation and this
president will solve social security.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that President Clinton and Gore had squandered eight
years by not addressing the problems posed by the retirement of the
baby boomers. ``At a time for leadership,'' Bush said, ``for
long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach. He
says, and I quote, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' But in the
lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke and we must
fix it. With every day of delay, this becomes more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has in large part staked his candidacy on the health of the
economy and made paying down the debt the centerpiece of his
economic plan. He has proposed extending the life of the retirement
system until 2054 by devoting the interest saved by paying down the
debt to the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his own appearance Monday, asked what would happen to
investments if economic prosperity abated. ``Today, when Wall
Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing,'' he said.
``It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money and have
more control over your retirement. But in reality, the Bush
privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic
guarantee of a minimum basic retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later in the day about his lack of detail, Bush called his
speech ``pretty darned detailed to be talking about a framework to
get something done.'' His aides said he had avoided specifics
because Hillary Rodham Clinton's abortive attempt to craft a plan
for universal health care coverage had shown that being locked into
one plan was a recipe for legislative disaster on a complicated
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of specifics on everything from what percentage of
the payroll tax would go to accounts, to what age group would see
the change, opened Bush to charges that he was masking some of the
hard choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he
could afford the transition and his sweeping call for a $1.3
trillion tax cut across the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of making the transition to such a system would be
significant _ as much as $1 trillion _ because the government could
have to pay out full benefits to current retirees while that same
amount of payroll taxes were being diverted into individual
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Bush and Gore feuded all day over which plan was
more risky and which would entail more of a shift of general tax
revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would either require
cuts in other programs or tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president asserted that Bush's plan would make it
nearly impossible to pay down the national debt. ``By leaving us
with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the
Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term
growth,'' Gore said. ``That undermines our chance to meet other
challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an
affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said
privately that they were pleased Bush had taken on Social Security,
because it sets up a clear policy difference between the candidates
and provides a big target to shoot at, much like former Sen. Bill
Bradley's universal health care proposal during the Democratic
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore intends to talk about Social Security two more times this
week _ before younger voters at Fordham University in New York on
Tuesday and before older voters in Florida on Wednesday. In his
speech Monday, he reissued his challenge to Bush to hold regular
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years an array of Republicans and Democrats
have proposed plans to overhaul Social Security that include an
element of private accounts. But the ideas have all died because of
sharp ideological differences, distrust between the parties and
fear of alienating the elderly, a reliable voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the plans would allow 2 percent of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax to be put into individual accounts. But the programs
differ quite significantly in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the economic complexities involved, a number of them
also call for such benefit reductions as raising the retirement age
or scaling back cost of living increases. And under one plan
workers would have to return their accounts to the government when
they retire and then receive a fixed monthly sum back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also expressed his support Monday for an approach to
Medicare that had been drafted by a bipartisan commission, which
would have converted Medicare into an arena for public and private
competition. Bush said the elderly should be given a choice of
health plans to buy including one providing prescription drug
coverage. He said Medicare itself should provide full drug coverage
for the most low-income elderly.

   ONONDAGA NATION _ The Oneidas want 250,000 rural acres in New
York state between the cities of Syracuse and Utica. The Cayugas
are staking claim to a 64,000-acre wishbone at the northern tip of
Cayuga Lake. The Senecas are eyeing the Buffalo bedroom community
of Grand Island. And the Mohawks, though distracted by a possible
Catskills casino, are asking for various islands and parcels
straddling the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these Indian nations, all members of the Iroquois
confederation, have demanded the return of vast swaths of New York
state land based on treaties dating back to George Washington's
administration. But within the next few months, the stakes will
increase as two cases head toward a trial and the Onondagas file
the last, and most valuable, Iroquois land claim: a heavily
populated tract of 64,000 acres that includes Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that Syracuse will suddenly change hands, or
that anyone will be forcibly uprooted. But with the Iroquois backed
by the federal government, the claims will probably lead to
settlements or litigation costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of
dollars, and could intensify the anger over one of the biggest and
touchiest topics in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike other states, particularly in the West, which
typically have Indian land claims in thinly populated areas
resulting from the federal seizure of land, New York occupies a
dubious position: it has more claims than any other state, but has
been the slowest to resolve those claims, which total roughly 620
square miles, about double the size of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem here that's over 25 years old,'' said Steven
M. Tullberg, director of the Washington office of the Indian Law
Resource Center, which has advised numerous Indian groups, ``that's
been passed from administration to administration, that's involved
lots of people, lots of money, lots of lawyers, and after all that
period of time, nothing is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   To some residents, the real issues are: why us? Why now? The
subject has triggered such an antagonistic reaction, it could be a
major issue in the fall elections and a potential problem for the
Democratic Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose
husband's administration has been accused by Gov. George Pataki of
giving unconditional support to unfair Indian land claims and a
lawsuit naming 20,000 landowners as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buying plazas, stores, entire tracts, farmland, and
the reservations are like checkerboards,'' said Leon R. Koziol, a
Utica lawyer who has represented several landowner groups. ``Then
eventually, what do you have? A virtual country within a country,
and it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iroquois, though, say the issue has never been about greed
or power. In fact, they have pledged not to evict any landowners.
What they say is at stake is redressing ancient wrongs and securing
a better future for their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   So it was all the more symbolic when about 50 chiefs from the
Iroquois nations convened a rare meeting in April just south of
Syracuse at the sacred longhouse that is the spiritual and
political heart of the Iroquois _ or as they prefer to be called,
Haudenosaunee.
</P>
<P>
   While the formal agenda, conducted solemnly in Iroquois
languages, focused on selecting new Mohawk leaders, the informal
discussion swirled around the nation-by-nation status of their
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been waiting a long time for this,'' said
Chief Oren Lyons of the Onondaga Nation. ``This is not something we
just made up.''
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1700s and early 1800s, New York state bought or
seized most Iroquois properties without congressional ratification,
thereby violating the Federal Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790.
Yet for years, the Iroquois failed to reverse these deals, stymied
by discrimination and legal obstacles, said Robert W. Venables, a
senior lecturer in the American Indian program at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Oneidas became the first Iroquois nation to file a
land claim in federal court. And in 1985, the Supreme Court sided
with the Oneidas, in a 5-to-4 decision concerning a ``test case''
that named Oneida and Madison Counties as defendants and claimed
only 900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the state and the Oneidas began settlement talks,
which yielded mostly accusations of foot-dragging. Then, in
December 1998, the Oneidas and the Justice Department, hoping to
pressure the state and the two counties, moved to name 20,000
landowners as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   People noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been much more activity in the last few months than
in all the years previous,'' said Richard Rifkin, deputy attorney
general for New York state, referring to all the claims.
</P>
<P>
   The landowners' predicament has prompted officials like Pataki,
Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Sherwood Boehlert to ask the Justice
Department to drop the 20,000 landowners from the Oneida suit.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, for instance, sent a pointed letter in early April to
President Clinton, accusing administration of offering
``unconditional support'' to a tribe that held residents ``hostage
under clouded real estate titles and the constant threat of
eviction, while systematically executing a plan to amass large
quantities of land upon which it pays no real estate taxes, evades
all state and federal environmental and land use regulations, and
wages a war of unfair business competition against the law abiding,
tax paying business owners in central New York.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in the Senate campaign, both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York City and Mrs. Clinton have sympathized with the landowners,
though neither has discussed the issue at length.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, an Oneida settlement seemed close thanks to
the diligence of a court-appointed mediator, Ronald J. Riccio: a
proposal of $500 million for the three branches of the Oneidas (the
others are in Wisconsin and Ontario), plus a cap on how much land
the New York Oneidas could eventually acquire to buttress their
current territory of 12,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   But several weeks ago, the talks collapsed, as the Oneidas
rebuffed the state's demand for 25 percent of the revenue from the
Oneidas' hugely profitable Turning Stone casino east of Syracuse.
So a trial may begin this summer before Judge Neal McCurn of
Federal District Court in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the only land claim to go to trial in New York has been
the Cayuga case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Cayugas, who have no land in New York, filed a
claim for 64,000 acres in Seneca and Cayuga Counties. In February,
a jury awarded them $37 million in a decision that stunned the
Cayugas, who had appraised the land at $660 million. But a second
phase of the trial is set to begin in July, and the Cayugas may
challenge the award.
</P>
<P>
   In northeastern New York, the struggling Mohawks claimed 15,000
acres in 1985, mostly in St. Lawrence and Franklin Counties, as
well as Barnhart Island _the site of the New York Power Authority's
Robert Moses-Robert H. Saunders hydroelectric dam.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the claim stalled, in part because of New York's
desire to collect taxes from non-Indians who buy goods on all
reservations. In recent months, though, the claim has become linked
to the tribe's controversial attempts to build a casino complex at
the Monticello Raceway in the Catskills. That project is now in
doubt, with the Mohawks mired in internal politics and juggling
separate deals with competing developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just adds some significant elements of confusion to what
was already a confusing situation,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   No less confusing are the Senecas, who live on three
reservations and have two separate governments in western New York.
They are claiming land in different areas, too, with the big prize
being Grand Island, a middle-class Buffalo suburb, population
18,500, in the Niagara River.
</P>
<P>
   The Senecas filed their claim for roughly 18,000 acres in 1993.
Not much happened, though, until only a month or so ago, Rifkin
said, when the state filed a motion to dismiss the case, based on
old maps disputing the Senecas' historic claim.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it is the Onondagas' turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Onondagas plan to file a claim of about 64,000 acres, which
would include Syracuse and Onondaga Lake, one of the most polluted
lakes in the country. At the same time, the Onondagas _
traditionalists who oppose gambling _want to help clean up the lake
and champion projects to benefit their resource-poor nation of nine
square miles, said Chief Irving Powless Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the land claim is going to cause some disruption, but
we want to work with the community to minimize that,'' said Joseph
J. Heath, a Syracuse lawyer who represents the Onondagas. ``We want
to be different from the Cayuga and Oneida areas, where all of the
politicians are acting as if they have hoods on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iroquois are not the only ones with land claims in the
state: in 1986, the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans, who are
now based in Wisconsin, filed a claim for six square miles, within
the Oneida claim. The Oneidas have challenged that claim, and
nothing has happened for years, ``not even a phone call,'' said
Sharon Greene-Gretzinger, tribal lawyer for the Stockbridge-Munsee
band.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, land claims may also be filed by several groups without
federal recognition, including the Shinnecocks and the Poospatucks
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Iroquois claims have particularly unhinged
residents in predominantly rural, working-class areas who sometimes
talk about land as a family heirloom, not a real estate commodity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just a matter of the Iroquois asking for land that
would quadruple the area of all current Indian holdings in the
state. It is the specter of the Iroquois accruing land, removing
them from the tax rolls and surrounding landowners and local
businesses in checkerboard fashion to where non-Indians feel
compelled to sell out, too.
</P>
<P>
   There have been protest convoys decrying the ``special
treatment'' of Indians, pickets of Indian-owned businesses,
newsletters from landowner groups with articles like ``Who were the
first Americans? Who Cares?''
</P>
<P>
   And the issue has become a big part of state politics. At a
recent meeting of a new Syracuse group, the American Land Rights
Coalition, Koziol and others discussed broader strategies like
lobbying trips to Washington, national alliances and
get-out-the-vote endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a political issue in our local elections this last
time, and, oh yeah, I see it having a great part in the elections
this year,'' said Connie Tallcot, a bookstore owner in Union
Springs, on Cayuga Lake. ``We're courting either party, and we
don't care who helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been enough of a cauldron that a Quaker group in Syracuse
recently sponsored public forums to try to defuse tensions in
anticipation of the Onondaga claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely don't feel upbeat, because knowing what I know
about the other land claims, it's not going to be an easy route,''
said Mary Teelin, a Syracuse nurse who has been active in landowner
groups. ``No matter who wins the lawsuit, they'll appeal, and
appeal, and appeal, and nothing is going to be resolved any time
soon.''  &QL;

VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES; ISRAEL CEDES 3
VILLAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take will move ASAP) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For the first time in almost four years, Israelis
and Palestinians exchanged live gunfire in the West Bank on Monday
as a wave of violent protest swept through the Palestinian
territories. Despite the fighting, Prime Minister Ehud Barak won
his Parliament's approval to cede three villages near Jerusalem to
the Palestinian Authority in an effort to advance the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The gun battle, which broke out a juncture near the Palestinian
city of Ramallah, accompanied chaotic confrontations throughout the
West Bank and Gaza, in which Israeli forces suppressed unruly
Palestinian demonstrators by shooting tear gas, rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition into crowds charging at them with
stones and firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of the rioting, live bullets suddenly appeared to
fly at the Israeli troops from Palestinian military police
stationed on a hilltop north of Ramallah. The Israeli troops
immediately responded with live fire, and for several hours they
and the Palestinian police exchanged automatic weapon fire.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, armed Palestinian men attacked Joseph's Tomb,
an Israeli enclave inside Nablus, shooting and throwing firebombs.
Another shoot-out ensued, in which a Palestinian youth was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said three Palestinians were killed _ a
police officer and two youths _ and 350 were injured. Israeli
officials said six Israeli soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations occurred on the anniversary of what the
Palestinians term the ``nakba,'' or ``catastrophe'' that
accompanied the birth of Israel. The protests were called also to
demand the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But the
violence expressed deep-seated frustrations among many
Palestinians, especially with the failure of the peace effort to
change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, spoke by
telephone Monday evening, and communicated through advisers several
times during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the violence in the West Bank slowly reached
the Parliament, embroiled in its own struggles. And since the
shooting was seized upon by the right wing as justification for
concerns about the Palestinians, it was met with sober-minded calm
by Barak and his government. Officials said they did not know the
facts, and did not want to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   Though three parties in the prime minister's fractious,
six-party coalition did not support him, and one quit the
government, the legislature voted 56-48 to authorize the
long-delayed, much-disputed transfer of the three villages to full
Palestinian control, which was originally intended by Barak as a
gesture of good will to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The move has ended up as an 11th-hour offering to salvage a
faltering peace effort as negotiations were stalled by the
escalating violence and the senior Palestinian negotiator quit.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials publicly expressed no thanks Monday night
for the three dusty, pothole-ridden villages, over which they have
exercised civil control since December 1995. In a speech to the
Parliament, Barak made it clear that Abu Dis, one of the villages,
was meant as a substitute for East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in Jerusalem, and they in Abu Dis,'' Barak said as
he sought to explain why the concession of an Arab village did not
seem like a surrender from his point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This embarrassed and infuriated the Palestinians, who publicly
aspire to make East Jerusalem the capital of their future state.
Yasser Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian official, dismissed the
transfer as a ``symbolic step.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Parliament vote, as darkness brought calm to most of
the West Bank and Gaza, tens of thousands of Jewish settlers filled
the heart of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first mass right-wing protest against the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations since Barak was elected last
May. From above, television cameras captured a sea of yarmulkes
that filled Zion Square and the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has bowed to the Palestinian rioters,'' said
Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party. ``On the day
they shoot, it is handing them territory.''

 &HT;    Suit puts seal of disapproval on signet
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union sued Richmond County on
Monday over the county's century-old Superior Court seal that
includes an apparent image of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that such images violate
constitutional church-state separation. But county officials say
the seal is not necessarily religious in nature, and that it has
been affixed to official court documents for more than a century
without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk of courts, her position is that it has been the seal
for at least 130 years and she doesn't feel like she should change
it. Nobody's complained,'' said Richmond County attorney Jim
Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Weber, an attorney for the ACLU in Georgia, said he has
received complaints. ``The basic point of it is it sends a message
that Richmond County is a (Judeo-Christian) county and people who
are not (Judeo-Christian) are outsiders,'' Weber said. ``Government
is supposed to be a place for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law that
required posting the Ten Commandments in public schools. In 1992,
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled it was
unconstitutional to display a plaque of the Ten Commandments in the
Cobb County courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU is negotiating with the city of Brunswick over a
gold-framed copy of the Ten Commandments that was mounted in the
temporary City Hall building
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and Richmond County, which includes Augusta, have
fought over this issue since 1998. In Augusta, Richmond County
officials have argued the numbered tablets on the court seal.

 &HT;    3,200 grads take big step at Emory
 &HT;    By Joe Earle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something Viranga Pathiraja's mother said about her daughter's
graduation from Emory University put everything in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm my grandmother's first grandchild to graduate from a
university,'' the 21-year old said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it hit me: My grandmother will be very proud,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,200 Emory students graduated Monday during the
university's 155th commencement ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, a key negotiator in
peace talks in Northern Ireland, told the graduates in his
commencement speech that they should speak out against
discrimination and injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never forget that in the presence of evil, silence makes you
an accomplice,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief address, Mitchell encouraged the students to
oppose any effort to deny education to all American children and to
demand public policies to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find that real fulfillment in your life will come not
from leisure, not from idleness, not from self-indulgence, but
rather from striving with all your physical and spiritual might for
a worthwhile objective that helps others and is larger than your
self-interest,'' he said. Monday, Pathiraja's parents and younger
brother, Asanka, watched her start the family's new generation of
graduates. ``It's a dream,'' said her father, Ananda Pathiraja.
``We're very proud of her.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Pathiraja will have the chance to bask in her
grandmother's pride during a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Pathiraja was born in Sri Lanka. When she was 2 years old, her
family moved to Jamaica. Then, when she was about 6, her family
settled in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Pathiraja plans to return to Emory in the fall for a job as a
research assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger brother also plans to return. He is enrolled as a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   That suits his older sister. After all, education is important
in her family. Besides, she said, ``that way I can keep an eye on
him.''

 &HT;    Andruw Jones comes of age
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hides it better than any player in the major
leagues. But this 23-year-old _ known to break out in an easy smile
at the plate, to run as if it takes no effort and to catch fly
balls near his waist _ is determined.
</P>
<P>
   His statistics give him away.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years of hearing the words ``offensive
potential'' associated with his name, along with the label of best
center fielder in the game, Jones has done something about it.
</P>
<P>
   He is rivaling the other Jones, reigning National League MVP
Chipper, as the toughest out in the Braves lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, no one is talking about Andruw Jones'
defense right now.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is hitting .309 to lead Braves regulars, and has a .417
on-base percentage. He leads in runs scored with 25, his 10 home
runs are second to Andres Galarraga's 11, and he is third in RBIs
with 20. Since he moved into the second spot in the batting order,
a move he has eyed since the leadoff experiment failed a couple
years ago, Jones has hit .345 (22-for-87) with an on-base
percentage of .477 and a slugging percentage of .713.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Philadelphia, he was a single away from becoming the
fifth Brave this century to hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not fishing as much,'' Greg Maddux said. ``I've
actually seen him take a strike. I don't think I saw him take one
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The formerly flailing Jones has found a new discipline at the
plate. Maddux and Jones agree that much of the credit goes to new
Braves hitting coach Merv Rettenmund.
</P>
<P>
   During batting practice, Jones will stand beside the cage at
Turner Field, with Rettenmund nearby. The matrix board will be
showing highlights from last season, including a shot of Jones
making one of his superhuman catches. Rettenmund will frown and
say, so that Jones can hear, ``Wonder why he didn't have any
offensive highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will give Rettenmund a stare before he gets in the batting
cage. Only then will Rettenmund break into a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the game, before batting practice, home or away,
Jones can be found wandering around the Braves clubhouse, bat in
hand, looking for Rettenmund for some one-on-one attention. When
they hook up and head for the cages, Jones might say something
like: ``Bring a camera. It'll be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Rettenmund will roll his eyes and say, ``I forgot,'' and
head for the training room. When he emerges, he says, ``Advil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like people that like to work,'' Jones said. ``He likes to
work, to go to the cage. ... We just talk. We like to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is learning some pretty valuable lessons along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach is myself,'' Jones said. ```You're the one who has to
go out and do it.' That's what he tells me all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last season, Jones was hitting .294 with an on-base
percentage of .372. He had struck out 29 times, while walking 16
times, three of them intentional. This season, his strikeouts are
down to 22 and he has walked 23 times, none intentional.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he also was another month away from hitting his 10th
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``More patient, more selective, quicker adjustments,'' Jones
said in explanation. ``I have a bad at-bat, (then) I can adjust for
my next at-bat. If I know the pitcher, I feel comfortable. I know
what he's going to do. Last year, I would just go out, see the ball
and hit it. If I hit, I hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was a microcosm of how far Jones has come and how
close he is to being something special.
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat, he doubled over the second baseman's head
into right field, an area of the field he wasn't much interested in
last year. The triple came cheap, because center fielder Doug
Glanville lost his popup in the sun and let it bounce in front of
him. But the same player who was benched for loafing in the
outfield in 1998 never hesitated and got to third on hustle.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to try for his single in his fourth at-bat,
Jones laced a ball up the middle and only some outstanding reflexes
from pitcher Trever Miller stopped him. The Andruw Jones of
previous years would have been trying to pull the ball. In Jones'
final at-bat, Scott Aldred struck him out on a nasty slider. Jones
recognized it and tried to check his swing but couldn't. Last
season, he might have swung himself around trying to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to get better pitches to hit, not trying to
do too much,'' Maddux said. ``He's maturing, learning more about
himself as a hitter. Andruw's always been real good at learning
from his mistakes. He's continued to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, pitchers have to think about it,'' Brian Jordan said.
``Before, they could throw something up there and know he's going
to chase it. He's relaxed. He's a more confident hitter. ... He's
really taking it serious now. Before it was just fun: `I'm just
happy to be here.' Now it's, `I'll accept my role and live up to my
potential.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' toughest critic also is his greatest ally. Rettenmund
knows the disappointment of trying to reach a talented young player
and failing. He spent the past two years trying to get to Ruben
Rivera in San Diego and watching Rivera hit .209 in 1998 and .195
in 1999. But in Jones, Rettenmund has found an open mind and an
eager ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Andruw is making progress,'' Rettenmund said. ``He
knows what he wants to do. He knows what he wants to be. If he just
keeps working like he is, what he's doing now, he's only scratching
the surface. He could be up there with anyone. The whole game is
his.''

 &HT;    Nuns and the Elain case
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the height of tense negotiations over Elian Gonzalez, Sister
Jeanne O'Laughlin presented her secret plan:
</P>
<P>
   Bring both families to the Rosarian Academy in West Palm Beach
for a reunion, followed by a hand-over of the Cuban boy to his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was someplace where you could drive the child and avoid a
lot of the trauma,'' O'Laughlin said she suggested to Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic school for preschool to eighth-graders was offered
during a mid-April session at the Miami Beach home of O'Laughlin,
who hosted talks between Reno and Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, federal agents seized the boy in a pre-dawn raid
on the Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   Rosarian Principal Mary DeVault said she learned of the proposal
through Adrian Dominican nuns housed at the school, nuns from
O'Laughlin's order. Devault said the school probably came to mind
because of its commitment to ``openness and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin recounted her role in the tug-of-war over Elian
during a Monday address to nearly 300 people at the Forum Club of
the Palm Beaches. Tears trickled from some when she pleaded for
Americans to understand the outrage of Cuban-Americans over the
possible return of Elian to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin became an ally of the Miami relatives after she said
she saw how the Cuban government manipulated a visit by Elian's
grandmothers to O'Laughlin's Miami Beach home in January.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers seemed relaxed, eating cupcakes and drinking
soda, until their Cuban escorts entered, she said. A sit-down
dinner was prepared for the grandmothers from Cuba and for the
Miami relatives, but the Cuban officials wouldn't allow it, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sensed fear as I did that day,'' she said. ``There
was terror in the hearts of those women.''
</P>
<P>
   She described Elian's affection for his 21-year-old cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who became his surrogate mother after Elian's
own mother died bringing Elian to Florida on a small boat in
November.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she was once called to the Miami house and found
a despondent Elian curled up in a patio lounger. Elian refused to
get dressed or leave the house until O'Laughlin promised to take
him to visit Marisleysis, who had been hospitalized for exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family was sleep-deprived and ``making bad
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, perhaps irrationally, thought if they were to
stretch a reunion with Juan Miguel Gonzalez over several hours,
they could win him over, she said. Gonzalez's attorney insisted on
no more than 60 minutes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, in their hope of hopes, they dreamed he would
defect,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian saga showed her the anguish of Cuban exiles and how it
is misunderstood by most Americans, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been living almost 20 years in South Florida, and it was
this terrible event that led me to understand the pain of the Cuban
people,'' said O'Laughlin, who is president of Barry University.
Returning Elian to Cuba, she said, was like tearing open their old
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Laughlin said she got death threats because she sided with the
exile community to keep Elian here. She recited some of them
Monday:
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you croak. ... May the fires of hell burn you. ...
Will bring a gun and shoot you in five places, one for each of the
wounds of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatred. Hatred. Why?'' O'Laughlin said in a voice heavy with
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us removed from the roots of being newcomers cannot
understand the pain.''

 JERUSALEM: them territory.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely miles apart, the violence in the West Bank and the
political turbulence in the Israeli Parliament seemed to be taking
place on different planes of reality. Israeli lawmakers, convening
for the opening of the summer session, bustled through the halls of
the Parliament, focused on the political game at hand: Who would
vote how and whether it would reshape the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is actually happening in Ramallah?`` Yitzhak Herzog, the
Cabinet secretary and a senior adviser to Barak, asked late Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When someone said that the Palestinian street was exploding from
pent-up frustration, he gestured around him. ``Talk about
frustration,'' he said. ``This is frustration!''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of the Palestinian territories, in Bethlehem,
Ramallah, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem and Gaza, the Israeli
Parliament's vote seemed distant and irrelevant. The demonstrators
chanted, burned tires and hurled stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers, venting rage in a way that at times verged on giddy,
defiant festivity. From rooftops and balconies, they had a cheering
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here not only to demand the release of our prisoners
but to say that the peace process is a game and it has failed,''
said one teen-age protester at the Bet El junction north of
Ramallah. ``Israel wants us to react this way and we are ready to
confront them.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials suggested that the Palestinian leadership
fomented the trouble to threaten the Israelis into making
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian leaders indicated that what they did was step
aside and let the people express themselves _ until the violence
got out of hand. Then they worked to quell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was close contact throughout the day between our
commanders and theirs,'' Barak told the Parliament. ``That doesn't
always work. The issue will have to be investigated. I am not
certain that at every moment and at every stage there was
willingness on the other side to act resolutely in order to stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that he would delay the physical transfer of the
villages until the situation was calm and it was clear what
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos Monday, Abed Rabbo, the senior Palestinian
negotiator, quit his post. He said that back-channel negotiations
were rendering the official, American-mediated ones meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Back-channel talks began in Stockholm, Sweden, several days ago
among Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli internal security minister; Gilad
Scher, an Israeli lawyer; Ahmed Qurei, the speaker of the
Palestinian Legislative Council also known as Abu Ala, and Hassan
Asfour, a Palestinian Cabinet minister. Palestinian and Israeli
security officials are also holding talks on the quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an Israeli game,'' Abed Rabbo said, suggesting that
the Americans were encouraging it, too. ``The Israelis think that
if they use several channels at once, they will find cracks in the
Palestinian position. So I am insisting on one channel, one team
and one position, and I leave it to those in Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the commotion, Dennis Ross, the American peace envoy, left
Washington for the region to resume mediation between Israel and
the Palestinians, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the day's violence, Barak found himself in an awkward
position when he argued to the Parliament that sober-minded
compromises in an intelligent negotiation were the only defense
against the region's descent into chaos and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid right-wing heckling, he delivered a disjointed speech in
which he defended his diplomatic moves and uncharacteristically
belittled the opposition as petty, fear-mongering and hypocritical.
The Likud Party government that preceded him made numerous
concessions to the Palestinians and serious missteps, he said.
``Don't preach level-headedness and security activity to us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Barak, also uncharacteristically, took on
Sharon, a fellow former general who served as defense minister in
the previous government. ``Don't tell us tales about Jerusalem,''
he said. ``You handed over Hebron, you recognized a Palestinian
state in Gaza and you brought Clinton there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon responded, ``That's a libel.'' And Barak shot back, ``You
are an old hand complaining about libels,'' referring to Sharon's
history of filing libel lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, including members of his own government, was
trying to portray the transfer of the villages as a security risk
and an indication that Barak would eventually capitulate to the
Palestinians' demand for a piece of Jerusalem itself.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party, which represents religious
Zionists, including the settlers, announced its five members of
Parliament would leave the government over the vote. The split was
a long time coming, although Barak issued a public plea for them to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak has been actively negotiating for the support of
the Shas, an ultra-Orthodox, Sephardic party with 17 Parliament
seats, Shas ministers and many members of Parliament walked out of
the proceedings and did not vote. Those who stayed opposed the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael B'Aliya, the Russian immigrant party led by Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky, is also considering quitting the
coalition, which would reduce Barak to a minority government.
``Natan is determined to leave,'' said Yuli Edelstein, another
party member. ``Not because anyone fell in love with Abu Dis, but
because if you give Abu Dis as a down payment, the final payment
will be half of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky spoke at the settlers' rally Monday night. It was a
tightly controlled demonstration, and its organizers repeatedly
appealed to the crowd to keep calm and avoid incendiary slogans.
There were still some blunt signs: Arafat's face as a skull and a
home-made poster that said, ``Mr. Barak has forgotten thee, O
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ora Zimmer, 64, a retired researcher from Hebrew University,
said she thought that the government was about to ``put Jerusalem
under siege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we talk about peace today?'' she said. ``They showed
us today what kind of peace we'll have.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
elected every president since 1929 and dominated Mexican political
life, is falling behind in the presidential race and is suddenly on
the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started for the party's candidate, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, when polls showed that he had been outperformed by
an opposition rival, Vicente Fox Quesada, in the first televised
presidential debate, on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Right afterward, Labastida deepened his followers' anxiety with
his reply to a college student who asked if he could lose the
election on July 2. He said he might.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, an opinion poll commissioned by Reuters showed
for the first time that Fox had pulled ahead of Labastida, 46.3
percent to 41.6 percent, with a 3.2-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of Fox has rattled the governing party, known by its
acronym in Spanish, PRI, as never before in a presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the fourth quarter, and the scoreboard is against the
PRI,'' said Jorge Chabat, a political analyst. ``They've never
played the game like this. They don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Labastida, acknowledging that his campaign was
hobbled with ``too much analysis and not enough action,'' rushed to
change its strategy and its staff.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped emphasizing that he represented a new incarnation of
the governing party, which he called the New PRI to distinguish it
from an old party notorious for corruption and economic
mismanagement. Now, Labastida has closed ranks with the old PRI and
conspicuously embraced its leaders, betting that he can win by
mobilizing the full powers of the party's vast political machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic in the PRI!'' read the cover of the weekly newsmagazine
Proceso.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has faced serious presidential challengers before. Many
Mexicans believe that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist
politician, won the election in 1988 but was squeezed out when PRI
officials altered the tally in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   But this year is different, because an independent election
agency is overseeing the vote and reforms have substantially
leveled the field. If Fox wins, he has a good chance of claiming
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 57, the candidate of the center-right National Action
Party, is running a campaign with flashy commercials and
choreographed antics that keep him in the limelight. He has a
cowboy bravado that some Mexicans like, and he has turned his
pungent country-style language on Labastida, calling him a
``shorty'' and a ``wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent whirl through the big-vote state of Veracruz,
Labastida seemed cooler than his campaign's outward appearance
suggested. In an interview aboard the campaign jet, Labastida said
he was confident that the PRI's far-reaching house-to-house voter
networks, unmatched by any other party, would ultimately deliver
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are strengthening the presence of our militant members
while taking the party closer to the people,'' Labastida said of
the turnabout in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Veracruz tour showed that the PRI's problem is not its
candidate. Although Labastida, a former interior minister, started
the race with a reputation as a colorless bureaucrat, on the road
he proved to be a vigorous and spirited campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   At two Veracruz rallies, Labastida ignored humidity that made
even his eyelids sweat and rushed into the crowd to receive hot
bear hugs and kisses from his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Although a PRI presidential candidate was assassinated in 1994,
Labastida prefers minimal security by plainclothes guards he
routinely leaves behind. He insists on driving, even on the
campaign trail, and at one point brought his convoy of six vans to
a tire-burning halt to allow a family of pedestrians to cross a
city street. They and everyone else on the block gaped in amazement
at the uncommon show of courtesy from a man of power.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has a knack for connecting with voters. A 37-year-old
single mother named Ana fought her way to him and tearfully
recounted that she had lost a job because employers had said she
was too old.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, who is 57, comforted her, talking all the while
about his equal employment proposals. In a speech to PRI members
that evening, he tossed away a prepared text to give an emotional
replay of the encounter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the candidate's problem is his party's record.
Although the economy has recovered, Mexicans have not forgotten the
currency collapse of 1994 or the PRI graft scandals that keep
coming to light. But many Mexicans also value the continuity of
seven decades of PRI rule and depend on the welfare state the party
built.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on that tradition, Labastida decided to fix his campaign
by clipping the wings of its reformist manager, Esteban Moctezuma,
who forged the concept of the New PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the candidate reinstated some of the party's hoariest
figures, known as dinosaurs, whom Moctezuma had left on the
sidelines. Oddly enough, the shift came only days after Labastida,
in the televised debate, had taunted Fox by saying, ``You remind me
of the old PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is an inclusive party,'' Labastida said in an effort to
explain the contradiction. He said he had reached out to those
party veterans who accepted the once rigidly authoritarian party's
new, more democratic rules of play.
</P>
<P>
   First Labastida was photographed at a PRI luncheon with Carlos
Hank Gonzalez, a former mayor of Mexico City who became a
multimillionaire during his political career. Last fall, when
Labastida was fighting for his party's nomination, he said he would
not accept help from the Hank family.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran party member Labastida named to his campaign was
Manuel Bartlett. As interior minister in 1988, Bartlett is widely
suspected of having rigged the presidential vote tally against
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida dismissed the ``things that have been said about
Manuel'' and praised Bartlett for siding with democratic change in
the PRI by running in the party's first primary last November and
accepting his loss to Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manuel Bartlett has good relations with most people in the
PRI,'' Labastida said, and added, ``He will not have anything to do
with overseeing the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The old guard came back in a rush that slipped out of
Labastida's control.
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders named Manlio Fabio Beltrones to help run the party's
legislative campaigns. In 1997, when Beltrones was governor of
Sonora, United States Drug Enforcement Administration documents
cited him as having ties to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Beltrones vehemently denied a report about the documents in The
New York Times and moved to sue for criminal libel. The Mexican
attorney general declined to press charges, noting differences
between freedom of expression laws in Mexico and the United States,
where the report was published. As governor Beltrones was popular
in his state, but he has not held public office since he stepped
down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida was taken by surprise when asked about Beltrones'
appointment a day after it was announced. ``I'm sorry, but I
haven't seen anything about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is already picking up steam. James Carville,
President Clinton's political consultant, has been advising
Labastida on how to be more media savvy. Now the candidate is
running communications himself. Hours after the Reuters poll was
announced, Labastida's team assailed its reliability, announcing a
survey by a pollster hired directly by the PRI, Stanley Greenberg.
It showed Labastida in the lead with 40 percent and Fox with 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the PRI has rolled out some of its well-worn
hardball tactics. According to an audio tape obtained by the
opposition, hours after the presidential debate, the PRI governor
of Chiapas, Roberto Albores Guillen, ordered his press staff to
lean on local newspaper editors to publish stories trumpeting a
victory for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the Chiapas headlines the next day, that is
exactly what they did. Four papers, including the leading one,
bannered headlines that read in one form or another that Labastida
had triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox was on a tour in the state of Puebla, a leader of the
oil workers' union there hung out the opposition candidate's
white-and-blue banner at the local headquarters. Top bosses of the
staunchly PRI union fired off letters ordering the local leader to
take the banner down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a massive operation to tighten down the screws,''
charged Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, the chairman of Fox's party.
</P>
<P>
   PRI supporters, while skeptical, said they were ready to answer
the party's call. ``I'm going to vote for them once more,'' said
Salvador Alejandre Martinez, a 30-year-old PRI follower at a rally
in Veracruz. ``But believe me, if things don't change, this is the
last time.''

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CAMPAIGN-POLL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 947 adults
throughout the United States. Of these, 716 said they were
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone exchanges called were randomly selected by a
computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, permitting access to both listed and
unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated
by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to account for household size and
the number of telephone lines in the residence, and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 4 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by talking to all
registered voters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for
example, may lead to somewhat different results.

LIFE IMITATING ART IMITATING LIFE IN A JAMAICAN MOVIE  
 DAVID GONZALEZ  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ The sound of helicopters flying over the
Kingston ghettos was not the kind of buzz the producers of ``Third
World Cop'' had in mind before this movie's hometown opening here
last summer. But with life intimidating art, the premiere of this
violent tale about a hardened police officer named Capone who is
fighting ghetto gunrunners, was postponed for two months while the
police and soldiers engaged in deadly battles against heavily armed
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers wanted to be sensitive to complaints that it was
not the right time for movie mayhem while there were real-life
clashes in the streets. The military occupation that followed led
some Jamaicans to denounce what they called the routine use of
excessive force in some of the country's poorest and most violent
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Capone would have understood the drastic measures. He dispenses
bullets and justice with an icy gusto that makes Dirty Harry look
like Mahatma Gandhi. He would just glare at his critics _ film,
social or otherwise _ and remind them, ``We run things, things
don't run we.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever qualms anyone had about Capone's tactics apparently
vanished by the time the movie opened in October; it went on to
become Jamaica's highest grossing movie. Yet the success of a film
about a take-no-prisoners lawman comes at the very time when
Jamaicans are grappling with the issues of rampant urban violence
and police brutality. Last summer a newspaper poll revealed that 26
percent of Jamaicans were so fearful of crime that they said the
police should shoot known criminals on sight. At the same time
advocacy groups have been calling for official inquiries into the
role of the police in several violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third World Cop,'' the movie and its protagonist, reflect that
dual pull, occupying the same nebulous territory in the minds of
many Jamaicans.
</P>
<P>
   The story line is of a bad man who is a good guy and who can
answer the gunmen and criminals on equal terms and come out well.
Barry Chevannes, dean of the faculty of social science at the
University of the West Indies, said: ``There is a feeling among
some people, and it may sound contradictory, that on the one hand
police tend to be brutal and hostile in many inner-city
communities. On the other hand, you get the very same people
demanding strong action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 25 years or so there have emerged cops who have
had that kind of an aura about them, of a very strong man, some of
whom become legends in a way. They can deal with criminals, but
people are obviously ambivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened is that people can identify with Capone and
Ratty, his childhood friend, whose desperation leads him into a
gunrunning scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is so individualistic down here, everybody thinks of
himself as the hero,'' said Chris Browne, the film's director.
``That's why we have such a hard time playing football, because
nobody can pass the ball to the next person to win. In Jamaica,
everybody wants to be a star. They look up to the novelty of a bad
man. That is because there is a certain thing in society here where
people identify with the bad man. He is the guy who takes the bull
by the horns and knows he's going to end up dead in a glorious
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie was inspired by the flamboyant exploits of a real-life
police officer who was an acquaintance of the film's producer,
Carolyn Pfeiffer. Through conversations with other police officers
and tag-along rides with special squads, the filmmakers learned how
guns were smuggled from the United States in barrels and hidden in
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   While many things they observed made it into the final film,
some did not. For instance, the role of the island's political
parties in arming gangs of partisans who turned the ghetto streets
into war zones in the 1970s and 80s is only touched upon.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said he was asked to stay away from politics. ``To me, it
was a difficult thing to write a movie about the inner city and
guns without writing about politics,'' he said, ``because they go
hand in hand. We touch on it, obviously not referring to any party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is like talking religion in Jamaica. People kill
themselves talking religion in the world. In Jamaica they do it
over politics.''
</P>
<P>
   What people do see in the film is a glimpse, simplified and
prettified by the casting of several famous dancehall music D.J.'s,
of the dead-end life that is all too common in the slums of
Kingston. It is a real world inhabited by characters like Ratty,
who forsakes the hard work needed to become a D.J. to make a fast
dollar smuggling guns. While Ratty is undoubtedly a bad guy, his
plight resonates strongly among younger Jamaicans who know that
many employers will not take a chance on anybody with a ghetto
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``That icon of the bad man in Jamaica, hustling to make things
happen for himself is very big,'' said Mark Danvers, who portrays
Ratty. ``Everybody can identify with that man. He is held up in the
songs and in the way that people in their early 20s carry
themselves. That is the man, the anti-state, anti-conformist fellow
because there is a deep distrust of the state. Lie after lie,
failure after failure and nothing ever gets better despite the fact
that people do work hard, nothing gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers also wanted to show the pressures that the police
are under as they confront a country that has been awash in guns
for decades and is now under the sway of dons, some of whom have
escaped the control of political leaders and allied themselves with
drug dealers. At times the situation has grown so chaotic that the
police have to enter neighborhoods under the protection of armored
personnel carriers. Nevertheless selling the idea of a tough cop as
a good guy is a daunting task in a society where news broadcasters
qualify attacks on the police as alleged confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 budget for the digital video production dictated
that some scenes, including those showing the heartwarming side of
villains, had to be left out, though there are hints of the side
when Capone begins to question his ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica that is portrayed in the movie is not one that most
tourists or many middle-class Jamaicans will ever encounter. While
it seems like a cartoon shoot 'em up at times, it retains an
essence of truth for many who know the hard-luck life of ghetto
residents. .
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people see themselves, that makes people think, if
nothing else,'' said Carolyn Gomes, a doctor who is a founder of
Jamaicans for Justice, an advocacy group active in low-income
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it will make those who are not so aware of life in the
ghetto a little more aware,'' she said. ``And hopefully it will
allow you to take a step back and see if that person is the person
you want to be, or if you want to do anything differently. That's
the function of all art, to see things in a different way.''

CANDIDATES CHALLENGE BEDROCK OF RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SOCSEC-CANDIDATES)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since it was established in 1935, Social Security
has had two fundamental principles. It has been a guaranteed
government benefit. And it has been self-financed, paid for out of
payroll taxes levied on workers.
</P>
<P>
   In reopening the debate Monday over how best to maintain the
solvency of the retirement system as the population ages, Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each challenged one of
those principles.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential
campaign so far, Bush proposed allowing individual workers to
invest a portion of their payroll taxes through private accounts.
His plan would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the
riches that Wall Street creates, but would also leave those workers
to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is
off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social
Security benefit, allowing it to remain a bulwark against poverty
in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Gore is
calling for the bill to be paid in part over the long run out of
general tax revenues _ in effect, heaving the problem onto the
shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.
</P>
<P>
   Those differing approaches to dealing with the financial
problems that threaten to afflict Social Security are at the heart
of a longstanding ideological dispute about the relationship
between government and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Democrats, Gore is comfortable with government as a
guarantor and sees Social Security as a collective commitment that
binds the generations. Like most Republicans, Bush is dedicated to
giving more power and responsibility to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, President Clinton and the Republican leadership
in Congress tried to find some common ground and failed.
</P>
<P>
   In elevating the call for private accounts to the presidential
campaign, Bush is asking for a mandate to break the deadlock.
Although Gore's approach would eventually require a fundamental
change in the nature of the system as well, the vice president has
cast himself as the defender of a program that has proved to be
perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is already clear that the clash between the two candidates
will be supercharged, with Gore in particular unleashing a
sustained attack on Bush's position. And the more heated the clash,
the greater the risk that the debate will so polarize voters and
unnerve politicians that it blocks progress for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good issue to debate as long as the discussion remains
civil,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office who is now president of the Urban
Institute, a research group. ``It could easily backfire and lead to
a situation where the lesson coming out of this campaign is, `Don't
try and deal forthrightly with the American people on this issue
when there isn't an immediate crisis.'''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that voters are split. In a survey conducted last
week, The New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 51 percent
thought allowing individuals to invest a part of their payroll
taxes was a good idea, and 45 percent thought it was a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and some Republicans wonder why Bush has chosen
to wade into such a polarizing issue. ``Politically it's not'' a
great idea, said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., one of the most prominent
advocates of adding private accounts to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a genuine act of leadership,'' Gregg said, ``because
if he's successful, he will have broken the iron triangle of
demagoguery _ Gore, Gephardt and the labor unions. And he'll have a
national mandate to do something in this area.'' His reference was
to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides also have electoral strategies in mind. For
Republicans, putting Social Security on the front burner is an
effort to attract what they see as an emerging investor class. More
than 50 percent of households now invest in the market directly or
indirectly. Many of them have had great success as Wall Street has
boomed, and are presumed by Republicans to want greater control
over their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also see private accounts as a way to grab the
attention of young voters, who tend to believe that Social Security
will not be around when their retire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats think that in the end the only groups that will be
motivated to vote on the basis of the candidates' positions on
Social Security will be the elderly and those workers nearing
retirement. Those groups have consistently opposed any fundamental
changes to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign is betting that young people will end up
voting on this issue,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.
``But recent history is pretty clear that the people who vote on
Social Security tend to be in their 50s and older, and their vote
is based on making sure that the system that's protecting their
parents is there to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to turn attention to the trade-off at the core of
Gore's plan, which is built around eliminating the $3.5 trillion in
national debt held by the public and capturing the interest savings
for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   When all the complexities are stripped away, Gore's plan would
leave the government in financially sound condition _ but would
also transfer to future generations of taxpayers the burden of
keeping Social Security solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore plan will eventually require a 25 percent increase in
income taxes _ the largest in our history _ or a substantial
reduction in benefits,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to keep the debate focused on the risks inherent
in investing Social Security money in the financial market _ and is
emphasizing that Bush's plan would leave less money to pay down the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan ``would weaken our national economy,'' Gore said,
and create the risk of millions of retirees ``left without enough
to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said one thing Monday that Bush would no doubt agree with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this
election,'' Gore said, ``which offers the country the most critical
choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935.''

A DESIGNER ON THE MOVE 
BARNEYS NEW YORK RETURNS TO FAMILIAR TURF 
A FILM INSPIRED BY ARMANI AND COMBS
</HEADLINE>
  By GINIA BELLAFANTE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory Parkinson is surely the only designer in New York,
probably the only one in Milan, Paris or Antwerp, too, whose
self-imposed bedtime is 8:30 p.m. Since he closed his Los Angeles
shop three years ago and gave up putting celebrities in big gowns,
Parkinson has led a hushed fashion life.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Los Angeles, he returned to his native England
before relocating to New York nearly two years ago, where he
started designing whimsically patterned jackets, skirts and
sweaters using old couture and upholstery fabrics and hand-dying
them in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's collections are tiny, with about 10 looks in each,
but his clothes were immediately picked up by Barneys New York and
Linda Dresner. Last year, Moeet &AMP; Chandon selected him to be in its
Bryant Park showcase of young talent. With his Fall 2000
collection, he tripled his orders over past seasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stone, the owner of Savannah, the stylish Santa Monica
shop where Parkinson has developed a following, attributed his
growing success to the fact that his clothes are, ``if not one of a
kind, then close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   BARNEYS NEW YORK RETURNS TO FAMILIAR TURF
</P>
<P>
   With fashionably glossed concrete floors, rolling racks and
enough Kiehl's products to keep an entire ZIP code's complexions
glowing, Barneys New York opened its Co-op shop at 236 West 18th
St. on Saturday. The store has the kind of weekend-oriented date
clothes featured on the two Co-op floors of Barneys' Madison Avenue
flagship. They are priced below Barneys' usual fare and are among
the store's best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown version of the Co-op sits on a relatively
untrafficked patch of Chelsea around the corner from the store's
original Seventh Avenue site. It occupies the space where Barneys'
semiannual warehouse sales are held. That tradition, oddly enough,
will continue, with the Co-op closing for the six weeks of the year
the warehouse sales take place.
</P>
<P>
   For the remaining 46 weeks, Co-op shoppers will have T-shirts,
jeans and items like $300-plus suede skirts and beaded tank tops to
try on in dressing rooms that, like the office bathrooms on ``Ally
McBeal,'' are anomalously unisex. ``We wanted to make it more of a
social thing,'' said David New, executive vice president for
creative services at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are men's clothes at all in the Co-op, as
well as the store's industrial design, distinguish it from girlish
shopping havens like Scoop and Calypso, which have fanned out all
over the city and attract the kind of shopper who, in another era,
would have looked toward the Co-op for things that weren't
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the new Co-op is to attract ``the downtown
neighborhood customer who didn't come uptown,'' Judy Collinson,
general merchandise manager of Barneys, said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Brown, founder of a nonprofit children's services agency,
Room to Grow, lives two blocks from the Co-op and visited it twice
over the weekend. ``I liked having all the cosmetics,'' she said,
but added that clothingwise, ``there wasn't much I could find that
was useful. They should have reached out more to the person who
doesn't want the slinky, beaded bias-cut dress or skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   A FILM INSPIRED BY ARMANI AND COMBS
</P>
<P>
   An aging Italian designer whose name is a megabrand is having
business problems. A brash young hip-hop star is aiming for fashion
moguldom. Hip-hop star sets his sights on taking over the Italian
house.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Armani's empire is not about to be bought by Puffy
Combs, but they are the inspiration for two characters in a fashion
film, ``Perfume,'' which finished shooting in New York last week.
Paul Sorvino is the Italian designer; the Gap model and actor Omar
Epps is the rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Leonelli, the producer, said the film, set for release
next year, features intersecting stories a la ``Short Cuts,'' and
all the acting is improvisational. Michael Rymer, an Australian
director whose family is in the fashion business, decided to make
``Perfume'' after taking acting lessons in the improvisational
technique.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, with Rita Wilson as an East Village designer,
Michelle Williams as a runaway daughter of a fashion editor and
Jeff Goldblum as a headhunter in search of new design talent, will
take shape in the editing room, Leonelli said, adding, ``Right now,
it's 10 movies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American fashion industry has been indebted to
Miuccia Prada for several seasons, and it looks as if she is still
the boss designer. Her shapes, colors and peculiar sense of luxury
were everywhere last week as retailers scouted the latest fall
accessories, and don't let some copycat tell you, ``It's just in
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   One spin around the Accessory Circuit, a trade show at Piers 92
and 94, told the story. The most ubiquitous handbag came in a
half-moon shape (think bowling ball dimensions) with clutch handles
and a retro color palette that favored maroon and light blue. Sound
familiar? Prada did the bowling bag for spring. If the Italian
company has moved on for fall, with its version of the doctor bag,
others are trying to keep up. Zerafa, a new company based in
California, was displaying a pair of rounded bags its
representative, Jenn Caig, called ``the large and small doctor.''
But, they still looked more like a strike and a spare.
</P>
<P>
   Prada's fall collection also included fur tippets tied loosely
at the neck. These were worn in a slightly careless manner, over
simple knits and sparkling evening sequins alike, and they made one
think of a tipsy but well-dressed matron emerging from Cipriani as
she hastily readjusts her clothes. On a gray dress form positioned
outside Elizabeth Gillett's booth at Pier 94, the tippet seemed to
lose some of its power. Still, the style will be among the most
prominent for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there's a major opportunity in fur _ fur handbags, fur
berets, fur-trimmed shoes and boots, and fur neck pieces,'' said
Sandra Wilson, the accessories fashion director at Neiman Marcus.
``It's part of a luxury statement in all fashion categories.'' Dana
Christy, who buys accessories for Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed, adding
that the most forward trends in handbags, scarves and other
accessories came from ready-to-wear designers like Prada, Donatella
Versace and Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   But most manufacturers have been a step behind. ``I found that
the accessories market was way out of sync with what was going on
in ready-to-wear this season,'' Christy said. ``Designers were into
ladylike, put-together clothes while the accessories people were
still doing bohemian.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there was a feeling of redundancy as one trooped down
the aisles at Pier 94 looking for signs of genuine novelty among so
many beaded or patchwork handbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all the embellishment,'' said Lisa Glass, a buyer
for Boyd's, a Philadelphia store owned by her father, Jerry
Gushner. Glass was with Debbie Blank, another Boyd's buyer,
inspecting soft totes in tweed and camel fabrics at the Clever
Carriage Co.'s booth.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Isaacsohn, the owner of the company, which she describes as
``the ultimate lifestyle collection for clever people,'' was
warming up with her sales pitch. ``The Louis Vuitton and Prada bags
are very heavy,'' said Isaacsohn, who worked for the British
retailer Marks &AMP; Spencer before starting her company. ``We don't
have a chauffeur to carry our handbags.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glass was saying she thought the tweedy bags jibed with
fall's casual chic, Liliane Wancer, who runs a buying office whose
clients include Lane Crawford in Hong Kong, stopped by. She ticked
off the big trends: ``Gold. Lots of big hoop earrings. Tweeds. Big
bags. Small bags are disappearing. Very ladylike looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wancer said it's understandable if stores often gravitate toward
a single dominant style, like the Prada bowling bag, even if such a
look is widely copied. ``A woman wants something that says to her
friends, `I'm in fashion,''' Wancer said. ``Everybody needs
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Accessories are a big business. According to the NPD Group, a
research firm that tracks apparel and accessory sales, more than $1
billion was spent on handbags alone last year. Many companies, like
Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton and Tod's, have found a successful
niche in the $500 to $900 luxury category, though most sales, the
NPD Group reported, are at much lower prices. The fact that many of
the accessory designers interviewed at the pier show started their
businesses less than two years ago is another indication of the
market's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Layne was working for a doctor's office when she and
Jill Roeb, a promotions manager for Warner Brothers, started their
hair ornament and jewelry business, Haute Stuff, a couple of years
ago. Today, their Los Angeles-based company sells such things as
suede headbands and paillette-embellished necklaces to stores like
Henri Bendel and Nordstrom. ``The accessories business is so
competitive,'' Layne said, ``you have to constantly come up with
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson of Neiman Marcus added: ``I think everyone wants to get
in on a look. The key is to know when to stay with it, and when to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   As insipid as the trend toward ladylike dressing may sometimes
seem _ with its conscientious revival of suits, pumps and those
overtly old-money gestures like pearls and tweeds _ it is giving
new life to accessories like belts and scarves. Christy of Saks
pointed to the oblong scarves that Lagerfeld showed at Chanel with
suits and flaring coats, and to the suede belts with trophy-size
buckles at Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Versace looked brilliant _ bombshell sex,'' Christy
said. ``This is the confident femme fatale, unlike the polished
one.''
</P>
<P>
   For polish and money, there is what Wilson calls ``the finishing
touches,'' so vital, apparently, in a season of put-together
dressing. That might mean a crocodile handbag, fur-trimmed boots or
a pair of rimless aviator sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or it could be all of that together on the right person,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Python and animal prints are everywhere for fall, too. ``It's
sex and fashion,'' said Barbra Musial, the vice president for sales
at Eric Javits, as she put on a fuzzy leopard-print cowboy hat
called Bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she was a bonanza, too, in sales,'' said Musial, who
refers to all of Javits' hats _ Lucky, Dude and the other new
styles _ by the female pronoun. Musial said fedoras will be big for
fall, but there is still action in the sexier Bonanza, which she
calls a ranch hat, ``because that's where the money is going now,
to ranches in Montana.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade shows tend to be down-to-earth reminders that not everyone
is ready for the latest topper or tippet. ``In 32 years, I've seen
everything,'' said Selma Pustin, the owner of a store in Baltimore
called That Handbag Place, as she and Emily Rosenthal-Levitas, a
buyer, stopped to speak to a reporter. They were dubious about the
prospects in Baltimore for doctor or bowling bags. They seemed more
confident about handbags trimmed with brightly colored beads, as
long as it wasn't overdone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have women who come in for those nylon bags,'' Pustin
said with a sigh, referring to the older Prada style.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal-Levitas gave a knowing laugh and said to the reporter:
``Aren't you glad you stopped us?''

ETRADE AND WIT CAPITAL JOIN TO FACE OFF-LINE RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acknowledging how hard it has been to break the stranglehold
Wall Street has on the underwriting of new stocks, two online
financial services companies, the ETrade Group and the Wit Capital
Group, said Monday that they would team up to compete against their
off-line rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade, a leading electronic brokerage firm, said it would form
an alliance with Wit Capital after that online investment bank
acquires EOffering, a competitor that ETrade helped to finance a
year ago. Wit Capital, which started out as a boutique brewery in
New York's SoHo district, said it would issue stock worth $328
million to the shareholders of EOffering.
</P>
<P>
   The deal coincides with the arrival of a potentially formidable
competitor: an online investment bank in San Francisco that is
being developed by Epoch Capital Partners with backing from the
Charles Schwab Corp. and two other electronic brokerage firms, TD
Waterhouse and the Ameritrade Holding Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the alliance, ETrade and Wit will form a mutually
exclusive relationship, with Wit as the sole provider of stock
research, initial public offerings and other new issues of stock to
ETrade's 2.6 million customers. ETrade expects to record a gain of
about $50 million on its investment in EOffering, a money-losing
venture that has had trouble building a stable management team.
</P>
<P>
   Christos Cotsakos, the cheerleading chairman and chief executive
of ETrade, proclaimed that the alliance would create ``a category
killer in the online financial services space.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts were less excited, characterizing the deal as
a trade-off that will allow each firm to concentrate on its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and competitors said that the deal demonstrated the
difficulty of building an investment banking operation from
scratch. Some saw it as a signal of more consolidation among online
financial companies that are too small to compete effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an admission that it is very, very difficult to move up''
the ranks of underwriters, said Richard Repetto, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers Holdings. ``Wit and EOffering were in a number of
deals, but they weren't the lead managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of lead manager of an initial public offering is the
most coveted on Wall Street. Those deals carry the biggest fees for
investment bankers, as much as 7 percent of the amount of money
raised from investors. But the firms chosen by corporations as lead
underwriters keep most of that money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Online investment banks have tried to persuade technology
companies to hire them for their expertise in distributing shares
over the Internet and for the technological savvy of their
customers. But most of the recent crop of Internet companies to go
public have followed the beaten path to Wall Street and chosen the
likes of Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
to manage their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   EOffering, whose other owners include the venture capital firms
General Atlantic Partners, Softbank Venture Capital and Battery
Ventures, had revenue of just $20 million last quarter and expects
to lose about $10 million in its current fiscal year. Faced with
the prospect of continuing losses if the market for new stocks
remains depressed, some of those investors approached Wit Capital
management about a deal a few weeks ago, people close to Wit said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives ETrade significant say in the operation of Wit,
which has about 100,000 customers. ETrade will have a stake of
about 7 percent in Wit, and Cotsakos and a partner in General
Atlantic will have seats on Wit's board. ETrade will also gain
access to a set of products that none of its competitors can offer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has benefits for Wit, too, analysts said. ``They
basically were able to eliminate a competitor from the
marketplace,'' said Amy Butte, an analyst with the Bear Stearns
Cos.
</P>
<P>
   It will also weaken a competitive advantage Epoch Capital
Partners had been citing to potential clients. ``Epoch's pitch to
issuers against Wit Capital was that Wit had only 100,000 accounts
versus Epoch's millions'' through Schwab, Waterhouse and
Ameritrade, Butte said.
</P>
<P>
   All of those firms and their online competitors have been
scrapping for bigger pieces of stock offerings, especially initial
offerings. That has not changed, despite the wilting market for new
stocks, said Suzanne Richardson, president of Fbr.com, the online
arm of the investment banking firm Friedman, Billings, Ramsey
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online investors are primarily interested in IPO's,'' she
said. ``But that's going to change. We will start to see online
investors as opposed to online traders.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the deal would most likely lead more established
investment banks to make acquisitions or form alliances that will
give them access to an online distribution channel.

COALITION URGES EASING OF IMMIGRATION LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Kemp, the former Republican candidate for vice president,
and Henry Cisneros, the former secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, are leading an unusual coalition of conservatives and
liberals that is beginning a major campaign to persuade Congress to
ease the nation's immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and Cisneros are scheduled to announce an initiative
Tuesday in conjunction with immigrant groups and the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops that calls for admitting more immigrants into the
United States and granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition brings together conservatives who view immigrants
as an important engine for the economy with religious leaders and
immigrant organizations who worry that many hard-working illegal
immigrants are consigned to exploitative jobs and lives with little
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the beginning of a new pro-immigrant
alliance that is likely to reshape immigration policy,'' said Frank
Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a
Washington-based group that supports the easing of restrictions on
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes Americans for Tax Reform, the United
States Catholic Conference, the Arab-American Institute, the
National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium and the National
Coalition for Haitian Rights. Another coalition member is the
National Retail Federation, one of many business groups that says
that with the unemployment rate so low, businesses sorely need
immigrant workers to fill their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, the truckers
organization and other businessmen, and they all said the biggest
problem we face is, we're running out of workers,'' said Grover
Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's statement comes as the presumptive presidential
nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have
sought to outmaneuver each other in wooing Hispanic-Americans and
other immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   For Kemp, the new effort is consistent with his longtime
practice of prodding many Republican leaders to jettison their
anti-immigrant proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to be issued Tuesday, the coalition will back a
proposal, embraced by President Clinton and the business community,
to increase the annual ceiling for the number of immigrants with
high-tech skills. But the coalition said Congress should not stop
there in changing immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition called for granting legal status to more than
300,000 immigrants who fled wars and political chaos in Haiti, El
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and applied unsuccessfully for
refugee status. The coalition said these immigrants should be
treated the same as those from Cuba and Nicaragua who have been
granted refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also backed granting legal status to more than
100,000 other longtime residents who have been in the United States
since before 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting irritating that the only immigration crisis that
Congress is prepared to address is the high-tech community's
crisis, while there is crisis in many other areas in immigration
policy,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy of the
National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil
rights group and a signer of the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas
for high-tech workers in each of the next three years, a major
increase from existing law, which limits the number of such visas
to 107,500 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for granting legal status to some groups of
longtime illegal immigrants, although many lawmakers have balked at
that proposal in the past.
</P>
<P>
   K.C. McAlpin, deputy director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, which pushes for stricter rules on immigration,
opposed the proposals to grant amnesty and increase immigration
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction is basically the same as the American people _
every time they're polled they say they want less immigration not
more,'' McAlpin said. ``The American people are adamantly opposed
to rewarding people who break our laws to come here illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   That view clashed sharply with the one adopted by the Roman
Catholic bishops. Kevin Applebee, director of migration and refugee
policy for the United States Catholic Conference, said, ``The
bishops strongly believe that the groups involved have lived in
this country for several years, established ties and built equities
and thus are deserving an opportunity to remain in our country on a
permanent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials who helped negotiate the statement said several labor
unions with many immigrant members were debating whether to sign.
The officials said those unions hesitated for fear of clashing with
the AFL-CIO, which has opposed expanding programs that grant visas
to high-tech and other skilled workers.

SEC UPGRADES PROBE OF BIG DIG FINANCES TO FULL INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission has upgraded an
investigation into whether Massachusetts misled investors about
finances of the Central Artery-Third Harbor Tunnel Project.
</P>
<P>
   The news that securities regulators have turned their
preliminary inquiry into a formal investigation was disclosed
Monday in an unrelated state bond offering for construction on
college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Information provided with the bond offering said the state
treasurer's office received notification a week ago that a formal
probe had been launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that the SEC has advised our office that they
are now conducting a formal investigation, and we will continue to
assist them as they move forward,'' Dwight Robson, spokesman for
state Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the SEC and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority,
which oversees the project, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, lawmakers released their plan to pay for what is
now estimated to be a $2 billion budget gap at the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, which regulates the securities markets, is examining a
December prospectus prepared by the state for a sale of $200
million in MBTA transportation bonds. The prospectus failed to
mention that the Big Dig was over budget, despite the fact that
project managers had known for months of a massive project deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The former Massachusetts Turnpike Authority chairman, James J.
Kerasiotes, disclosed Feb. 1 that the project was over budget.
Kerasiotes was later fired for failing to reveal the financial
problems sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported in February that the agency had begun a
preliminary inquiry into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sources have said that investigators want to know exactly when
state officials learned of the budget gap. The SEC wants to
determine whether investors buying state bonds were misled about
the cost of the Big Dig, as well as whether the project posed any
risk to the state's overall fiscal condition, which could affect
borrowing for other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials fear that the SEC is seeking to make an
example of Massachusetts for failing to be forthright about the
project. Bond buyers and others familiar with the SEC say the
agency has recently been cracking down on those who violate rules
for disclosure pertaining to the sale of municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has taken action at least 95 times in the past six
years for state and local government bond sales, mostly for lapses
in disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what kind of action the SEC may take against the
state if it finds violations. The agency can seek criminal fraud
charges against public officials if it finds that they failed to
disclose relevant information that caused financial harm to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers and others familiar with Wall Street have said that
it may be difficult for the SEC to make a case that the state's
failure to be truthful about the Big Dig overrun harmed investors.
</P>
<P>
   After the project's financing gap was revealed, Massachusetts
bonds sold at a lower rate of return than bonds sold last year.
That indicates that investors are not overly concerned about how
the Big Dig cost overruns affect the state's overall fiscal
condition and other state bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser penalties the SEC can impose include civil fines levied
against individuals or the agency and a cease-and-desist letter
designed to prevent future failure to disclose information.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci has already admitted that he knew last
fall about a potential overrun. However, he insisted there were no
hard figures for the budget gap at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other state officials went to Wall Street in
December and won an upgrade in the state's bond rating from Moody's
Investor Service.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he told the rating agency at the time that a
financial analysis of the project was underway and costs could
increase. Since then, he has insisted that the state was
``straightforward with the people on Wall Street.''

<P>
   Gregory Parkinson is surely the only designer in New York,
probably the only one in Milan, Paris or Antwerp, too, whose
self-imposed bedtime is 8:30 p.m. Since he closed his Los Angeles
shop three years ago and gave up putting celebrities in big gowns,
Parkinson has led a hushed fashion life.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Los Angeles, he returned to his native England
before relocating to New York nearly two years ago, where he
started designing whimsically patterned jackets, skirts and
sweaters using old couture and upholstery fabrics and hand-dying
them in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's collections are tiny, with about 10 looks in each,
but his clothes were immediately picked up by Barneys New York and
Linda Dresner. Last year, Moeet &AMP; Chandon selected him to be in its
Bryant Park showcase of young talent. With his Fall 2000
collection, he tripled his orders over past seasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stone, the owner of Savannah, the stylish Santa Monica
shop where Parkinson has developed a following, attributed his
growing success to the fact that his clothes are, ``if not one of a
kind, then close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   BARNEYS NEW YORK RETURNS TO FAMILIAR TURF
</P>
<P>
   With fashionably glossed concrete floors, rolling racks and
enough Kiehl's products to keep an entire ZIP code's complexions
glowing, Barneys New York opened its Co-op shop at 236 West 18th
St. on Saturday. The store has the kind of weekend-oriented date
clothes featured on the two Co-op floors of Barneys' Madison Avenue
flagship. They are priced below Barneys' usual fare and are among
the store's best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown version of the Co-op sits on a relatively
untrafficked patch of Chelsea around the corner from the store's
original Seventh Avenue site. It occupies the space where Barneys'
semiannual warehouse sales are held. That tradition, oddly enough,
will continue, with the Co-op closing for the six weeks of the year
the warehouse sales take place.
</P>
<P>
   For the remaining 46 weeks, Co-op shoppers will have T-shirts,
jeans and items like $300-plus suede skirts and beaded tank tops to
try on in dressing rooms that, like the office bathrooms on ``Ally
McBeal,'' are anomalously unisex. ``We wanted to make it more of a
social thing,'' said David New, executive vice president for
creative services at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are men's clothes at all in the Co-op, as
well as the store's industrial design, distinguish it from girlish
shopping havens like Scoop and Calypso, which have fanned out all
over the city and attract the kind of shopper who, in another era,
would have looked toward the Co-op for things that weren't
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The main purpose of the new Co-op is to attract ``the downtown
neighborhood customer who didn't come uptown,'' Judy Collinson,
general merchandise manager of Barneys, said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Brown, founder of a nonprofit children's services agency,
Room to Grow, lives two blocks from the Co-op and visited it twice
over the weekend. ``I liked having all the cosmetics,'' she said,
but added that clothingwise, ``there wasn't much I could find that
was useful. They should have reached out more to the person who
doesn't want the slinky, beaded bias-cut dress or skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   A FILM INSPIRED BY ARMANI AND COMBS
</P>
<P>
   An aging Italian designer whose name is a megabrand is having
business problems. A brash young hip-hop star is aiming for fashion
moguldom. Hip-hop star sets his sights on taking over the Italian
house.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Armani's empire is not about to be bought by Puffy
Combs, but they are the inspiration for two characters in a fashion
film, ``Perfume,'' which finished shooting in New York last week.
Paul Sorvino is the Italian designer; the Gap model and actor Omar
Epps is the rapper.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Leonelli, the producer, said the film, set for release
next year, features intersecting stories a la ``Short Cuts,'' and
all the acting is improvisational. Michael Rymer, an Australian
director whose family is in the fashion business, decided to make
``Perfume'' after taking acting lessons in the improvisational
technique.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, with Rita Wilson as an East Village designer,
Michelle Williams as a runaway daughter of a fashion editor and
Jeff Goldblum as a headhunter in search of new design talent, will
take shape in the editing room, Leonelli said, adding, ``Right now,
it's 10 movies.''

JONES MAKES HOME DEBUT AS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bobby Jones is the winningest minor-league
manager in the Rangers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't impress Rangers fans, maybe this does: Asked
yesterday to name the best players he has managed, he laughed and
said, ``Sosa, Gonzalez, Pudge.''
</P>
<P>
   That short list _ former Rangers outfielders Sammy Sosa and Juan
Gonzalez and catcher Ivan Rodriguez _ demonstrates the depth of
Jones' roots in the Rangers' organization. He managed all three as
they came up in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Jones further cemented his place with the Rangers
when he was named a full-time coach with the major-league team. He
had joined the staff on an interim basis last week after the
retirement of third-base coach Ed Napolean.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 50, a former outfielder who spent parts of nine years
with the Angels and Rangers, will work with the outfielders, the
Rangers said. He had been manager of the Rangers' Double-A team in
Tulsa since 1995, managed at Oklahoma City in 1994 and 1993 and at
Tulsa in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He has also managed at Charlotte and has a managerial record of
832-866 with two championships _ the Florida State league title at
Charlotte in 1989 and the Texas League championship at Tulsa in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, the Rangers said Charlotte manager James Byrd
will manage the team at Tulsa effective tomorrow and that Bob
Miscik, roving minor-league instructor, would assume the manager
duties at Charlotte starting last night. Assistant coach Moe Hill
was scheduled to manage at Tulsa last night and tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're in the minor leagues, as a player or a
manager, your goal is to get to the major leagues,'' Jones said.
``Since my first year of managing in '88, it's been a goal of mine
to get back up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones retired in 1986 as a .221 hitter with 23 career home runs
but holds the Rangers' record for pinch hits (42).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the organization a long time. It's good to see
him get a chance,'' Rodriguez said. ``He knows a lot about the
game. He helped me a lot. He taught me a lot about baseball. He's a
great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who signed his first professional contract in 1967 with
the Washington Senators, remembers the rising careers of Sosa,
Gonzalez and Rodriguez in the minor leagues. Perhaps the most
pleasant surprise was Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Juan, you knew he was going to play in the big leagues.
Sosa struck out 150 times for me one year and hit .220, .230,''
Jones said. ``But his work ethic, his determination and drive, was
outstanding. Of course, nobody could have predicted he'd hit 50
home runs. And he could fly. He'd hit a comebacker to the pitcher
and make it a bang-bang play at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa is the same today as he was an 18-year-old. He has the
same personality.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge was another very hard worker. He didn't pull the ball as
much as he does now.''

COLONIAL'S FACELIFT KEEPS THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A shuffle of the course awaits PGA Tour
competitors this week at the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Along with acres of resurfaced ground come new ground rules for
what is chic and not-so-chic heading into Thursday's opening round:
</P>
<P>
   Bunker putts are out. Sand saves are in.
</P>
<P>
   Boring bridges are out. Stonework facades are in.
</P>
<P>
   Unobstructed shots from the rough are out. New trees are in (68,
to be exact).
</P>
<P>
   Poa-annua grass is out. Heat-tolerant, velvet-smooth A-4 bent
grass is in.
</P>
<P>
   It is that latest addition, which has taken Colonial's greens
from first generation to fourth generation of bent-grass
development, that is at the heart of a $3.5 million renovation
project that has occurred at the club since the final putt dropped
at the 1999 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Colonial officials said, are rebuilt putting
surfaces that offer the truest rolls the course has seen since it
opened in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the pros, I don't think the course will play that much
different, tee to green. But if there's no wind during the
tournament, we may see some record scores,'' said David Hull,
chairman of the Colonial greens committee that oversaw the
reconstruction project. ``Once they get on these greens, the pros
are going to do very well. The greens turned out superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, in the estimation of club officials, they look just
like the old ones to the casual observer. In fact, the whole course
_ with rare exception _ meets that description. That was the charge
presented to Keith Foster, the St. Louis-based architect who gave
Colonial its face-lift between June 1999 and April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials sought to add strategic bunkers, make
existing bunkers more penal, rebuild the greens to original
specifications and rid the putting surfaces of an infestation of
poa-annua grass. In addition, they wanted to improve course
drainage, beautify the bridges and reroute cart paths to make them
less conspicuous. And they wanted to do it, Hull said, with enough
subtlety that ``85 percent of the members will look out there and
think nothing's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished, in the estimation of club officials. Early
returns indicate the touring pros like the subtle nuances they've
noticed, although they don't expect them to significantly impact
scoring during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a nice change,'' said Mark Brooks, a Fort Worth
resident. ``The greens are firmer, but they're not rock-hard.
That's good. There are a couple of holes that get your attention.
But overall, the changes aren't that significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial, in other words, ``still looks like Colonial,'' said
Ben Crenshaw, a two-time champ who huddled with club officials
during the renovation process to lobby for keeping the contours of
the greens the same as they have been since the course opened.
Crenshaw's words, Hull said, helped sway some who thought the
rebuilt greens could use more undulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I told them was to keep it looking and playing like
Colonial ... because that's always been a great test of golf,''
said Crenshaw, who is preparing for his 30th consecutive Colonial
appearance, a tournament record. ``It's a very traditional course,
and it's stood the test of time. From a historical standpoint, I
thought it should play as closely as possible to the way it's
always played. I know \Rclub members\S are very pleased, and so am
I. I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since tournament officials slipped a plaid jacket around the
shoulders of Olin Browne to conclude the 1999 event, all 18 greens
have been rebuilt to eliminate the effects of erosion. Each putting
surface was laser-measured in 5-foot sections, assuring that all
contours were rebuilt within a quarter-inch inch of original
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The greens were covered with A-4 bent grass, which is more
heat-tolerant and disease-resistant than its predecessor, a
Pincross bent. The new bent has almost twice as many blades per
square inch, resulting in truer rolls on putts.
</P>
<P>
   Around the course, some bunkers were added, others removed. Most
were given sharper lips to make the escape angles more severe. All
83 bunkers are equipped with drainage systems, and the new greens
have sub-ground air pumps that help eliminate surface moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said the course had 82 bunkers during the 1999 Colonial.
Although there will be one additional sand trap this year, Hull
said Colonial's total bunker space has been reduced by 13,000
square feet because the new traps tend to be smaller but placed
more strategically.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, six holes have been lengthened by a combined 95
yards and roughly half of the 68 new trees were placed within 10
yards of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of affecting play, the most significant alterations are
new tee boxes that lengthen hole Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 18. The
rebuilt greens will allow for new pin placements, many of them
behind bunkers that have been added or enhanced since the 1999
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put the hole closer to the edge than before on some
greens. We probably picked up three or four tougher pin
placements,'' said Mark Russell, PGA Tour tournament director in
charge of setting up the course. ``Otherwise, I don't think it'll
play much different at all. It's such a great old course, you
wouldn't want to do anything to it to change it significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Members point to the new bunkers as the course tweak most likely
to generate higher scores from the touring pros. In recent years,
Colonial's bunkers had ceased being a major concern for players
because they were too shallow and often allowed shots to roll in
one side and out the other.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's Colonial, only two of 120 drives charted by
tournament officials remained in a fairway bunker left of the first
fairway. Several others, Hull said, zipped through the bunker and
back into the rough, allowing players at least an outside chance to
reach the par-5 green on their second shots.
</P>
<P>
   A more glaring example of Colonial's toothless bunkers occurred
in 1991, when Tom Purtzer ``putted'' for birdie from a greenside
trap in the final round. The shot, which traveled 35 feet _
including the first 10 feet over sand _ is considered the signature
stroke in tournament history. It allowed Purtzer to build on a
one-stroke lead en route to a three-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it underscored that Colonial's bunkers were less than a
threat to the touring pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to have a deal classified as a hazard and watch
people be able to putt out of it,'' Hull said. ``He'll need a
60-degree loft on that putter to get out of that bunker now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, more appropriately, a sand wedge. The course changes should
make that club more useful this season, especially at fresh or
rebuilt greenside bunkers at Nos. 3, 5, 11, 13, 15, 16 and 18. In
addition, strategic fairway bunkers were added or moved to pinch
drives at Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Hull cited a redesigned bunker complex left of the landing area
at No. 3 as the ``most severe'' alteration in terms of affecting
tee shots. Greenside bunkers at No. 11 are far more visible, and
more plentiful, than last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic change is at No. 15. Three fairway bunkers
were brought more into play, the green was enlarged and a greenside
bunker was added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest change on the course,'' said Harold
Muckleroy, a tournament committee member and former club president.
``Not only the tee shot, but you've got a lot to think about with
more trouble around the green. It's subtle, but dramatic. It'll get
the pros' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the greens. And the fairway bunkers. And the extra 95
yards, spread over six holes. Ideally, however, players and fans
will leave with a sense that little has changed at the course
Marvin Leonard founded in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room here for anyone else's paw print but Marvin
Leonard's,'' said Scott Corpening, a tournament committee member.
``It's up to us to protect and defend what he built. And I think
we've done a decent job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the pros will say we took a traditional course and
made it better without changing its character,'' Hull said. ``If 95
percent of them think that, we'll be happy. There's always five
percent that will find something to gripe about. But those are
usually the guys who leave town on Friday night.''

Rogers to miss start 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Kenny Rogers will miss at least his next
start because of a strained posterior capsule in his left shoulder,
an injury that occurred on a throw to first base in his outing
against the Anaheim Angels on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI revealed nothing worse than the shoulder strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tweaked it,'' Rogers said. ``I'll let it calm down and
be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark moves up a day to replace Rogers against Tampa Bay
today, and Doug Davis is scheduled to pitch tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers knew he was hurt when his shoulder tightened when he was
in the dugout after making the throw to first for the final out of
the seventh inning, he but went out for the eighth inning and tried
to pitch through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't help matters when I went out in the eighth,'' he
said. ``A smarter guy wouldn't have gone back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said making his next start will depend on if he's able to
do his side work.  &QL; 
Catalanotto's back
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto was activated from the disabled list, but his
old role was not waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto was in a platoon situation before injuring his
groin, starting at second base against right-handed pitchers with
Luis Alicea moving to third. Catalanotto also was playing well,
with a .500 batting average (12-for-24).
</P>
<P>
   Since he went on the DL on April 22, however, Mike Lamb has
taken over at third and has played well with a .297 average before
last night. Alicea has continued to play well at second, with a
.326 average.
</P>
<P>
   When Tampa Bay started right-hander Dave Eiland last night, the
switch-hitting Alicea and the left-handed hitting Lamb were in the
lineup, with Catalanotto on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do about it,''
Catalanotto said. ``I'm not going to lose any sleep over it,
because I think things will work themselves out. We're here to win,
and right now that combination is working well. Until that changes,
I'm going to have to accept my role as a pinch hitter and a spot
starter.''  &QL; 
Greer, Kapler updates
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer began a medical rehabilitation
assignment at Double-A Tulsa yesterday, and the Rangers hope to
have him back in the lineup for Thursday's game against the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, out since April 13 because of pulled hamstring and ankle
surgery, is scheduled to play two games for the Drillers and return
to Arlington tomorrow to work out with the team. Barring setbacks,
he then would be activated.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Gabe Kapler, who went on the DL on May 4 because
of a partially torn upper right quadriceps muscle, could be ready
to return when he's eligible Friday
</P>
<P>
   He ran in the outfield yesterday at about 90 percent without any
problems. The final test will be running the bases at full speed,
which he'll do either tomorrow or Thursday.  &QL; 
Duval takes his hacks
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour golfer David Duval took his swings with the Rangers
yesterday and did something rare for a golfer: miss.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the world's second-ranked golfer, spent about 45 minutes
in batting practice with the Rangers before last night's game and
got the bat on the ball consistently. But he did swing and miss
twice, once as he was late on a fastball and once when he missed a
bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitcher Rick Helling sympathized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never swung and missed any golf balls, but I've hit some
that were crooked once in a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who competed in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in Irving
last weekend and is scheduled to compete in the MasterCard Colonial
in Fort Worth this week, participated at the invitation of Rangers
pitching coach Dick Bosman. The best shot off the bat of Duval, who
said he last played baseball in Little League, was a ball that fell
a little shy of the warning track in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I can come to a ballgame, I like to,'' he said. ``It
happened that the Rangers were coming back in town, I had a day off
and I could do it. I didn't know I could take batting practice. I
thought I'd just come in, mess around a little bit, just be around
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?''  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitchers took batting practice for the first time this
season in preparation of the start of interleague play next month,
and six of them hit home runs. The first interleague game at a
National League park, when pitchers will be required to hit, comes
June 9 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Evans, who went on the DL to make room for Catalanotto,
hasn't decided whether to try to rehabilitate his partially torn
right rotator cuff or undergo season-ending surgery. The Rangers
are trying to schedule an appointment with Birmingham, Ala.,
orthopedist Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on
Evans in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland will be inducted as the 12th member of the
300-Save Club during an on-field presentation before Thursday's
game. Wetteland earned his 300th save Friday at the age of 33
years, eight months, and 21 days, tying Lee Smith as the youngest
to reach the milestone.

INDIANA ASSURES THAT ABUSES BY KNIGHT WON'T STOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indiana University assured us that there will be another victim
yesterday with a spineless slap on the wrist for embattled
basketball coach Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of terminating the belligerent Knight for a litany of
embarrassing offenses that should have been enough to get him fired
long ago, Indiana's president and board of trustees once again took
a knee and kissed the hem of the coach's trademark red sweater.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dark day in college sports when a tyrant is allowed to
continue his dictatorship at the cost of yet another innocent
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, somebody else will pay now.
</P>
<P>
   Another 18-year-old boy might be physically abused, choked,
kicked, pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   A 64-year-old secretary might be berated in a wall-shaking
explosion of obscenities. Hopefully, her boss _ and Knight's _ will
be there to protect her again the next time it happens.
</P>
<P>
   A flunky from the sports information office might be punched and
pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   An athletic director who has the audacity to offer consolation
to Knight after a tough loss might find himself under physical and
verbal assault.
</P>
<P>
   A sports writer, trying to do his job, will be humiliated and
intimidated when the ``great'' coach shouts him into submission
after a Hoosiers' loss.
</P>
<P>
   A fan in a restaurant might be slapped around for daring to
question the great Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Indiana gave us yesterday in one of the most
cowardly stands by a major university in the history of sports.
</P>
<P>
   One more chance for Knight to make an ass of himself in public.
</P>
<P>
   That's real punishment, guys. Congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   But then, why should we have ever expected anything more. Until
somebody showed up with a ``smoking gun'' _ a few seconds of grainy
black and white videotape showing Knight choking player Neil Reed
during a 1997 practice _ the coach had done anything and everything
he wanted and gotten away with it.
</P>
<P>
   How many of us could scream obscenities at a senior office
secretary _ Knight called her a name we won't even begin to repeat
this close to Mother's Day _ and not be fired? How many of us could
physically threaten our boss and not be in the unemployment line an
hour later?
</P>
<P>
   How many could put a choke hold on an 18-year-old youth whose
parents we'd promised to protect like he was our own, and skate
away unscathed? How many times could we stand in front of our
company's logo and bully, intimidate, kick, throw chairs and act
like a total jerk?
</P>
<P>
   Knight did it, time and time again, while representing a major
university's athletic program. That doesn't even count tasteless
coaching tricks, like putting a tampon in a player's locker or
waving soiled toilet paper under his player's noses to show what he
thought of their play.
</P>
<P>
   And now that university has promised us that there will be yet
another victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ethical approach is to give him one last chance,''
Indiana president Myles Brand, a close friend of Knight's, said at
yesterday's news conference. ``We have established tough, specific
guidelines to send a clear message that abusive and embarrassing
behavior will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, and it only took 29 years, too.
</P>
<P>
   Almost makes you forget that Knight's contract for years has
contained a clause that he can be dismissed if he ``has been guilty
of personal conduct which would be grounds for punitive discharge
of any employee of the university generally.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's not kid ourselves, as much as Brand might hope that we
would. Knight has never been held to the same standard as others at
Indiana or any other university. He has always gotten away with his
bullying, abusive behavior, even with his own son, and there's no
reason to believe he'll change now.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who was calmly fishing in the Bahamas while the Indiana
board of trustees conducted an investigation into the latest
charges against him, didn't even take yesterday's event seriously
enough to show up for the news conference. Why? Because he was
doing something far more important: turkey hunting.
</P>
<P>
   And he's about to leave for a vacation in Scotland, which seems
appropriate since he walked away Scot free from this crisis. The
three-game suspension and $30,000 fine are meaningless. If Knight
is guilty _ and no one's ever bothered to deny that _ the only
appropriate response is termination. If he's not guilty, he
shouldn't have even been reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part of the whole tawdry Knight affair is the shadow
it casts on other coaches. Coaches, those I've had and those I've
known, have played a big role in my life and in the lives of others
I've known. They were the ones I looked to for discipline. Some
were tough but they were always fair.
</P>
<P>
   I've been grabbed by the shoulder pads, as many another junior
high and high school player has been, and shoved into the position
I was already supposed to have taken. But it was never purposely
abusive or bullying.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that you have to be like Knight to win games or have a
high graduation rate is ludicrous. He cannot hide behind the guise
of simply being a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   That this was coming became obvious Saturday when Knight
released a conciliatory statement apologizing for his temper. This
was clearly orchestrated as a preliminary to the ``pardon,'' which
came yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And who orchestrated this sickening charade? The see-no-evil
board of trustees? Brand, the gutless school president?
</P>
<P>
   None of us are naive enough to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they don't call Bobby Knight ``The Little General''
for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He wants at least one more victim before he's through.

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When he recruited catcher Kelly Shoppach out of
Brewer High School two years ago, Baylor coach Steve Smith
anticipated grand and instant developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had visions of conferences on the mound between him and
\Rpitcher\S Jason Jennings where there would be so much talent
concentrated there that the field would slant,'' Smith recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings went on to win national player-of-the-year honors last
year, but Shoppach ran smack into the Freshman Cobwobblies, a
familiar malady for which there is apparently no cure _ except to
grow a year older.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. After last season Shoppach had a
heart-and-soul chat with Smith, then departed for the summer,
dropped 50 pounds, made a few mental adjustments and emerged as the
player he is today, helping lead Baylor to the Big 12 Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good a defensive catcher as I've ever been around,''
Smith said. ``He's the best in the Big 12 and one of the best in
the nation. He can play this game a long time just with those
skills, but there's no doubt he will also develop as a hitter. With
his strength, I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he did poorly this season, hitting .309 with a
team-leading nine home runs. Now a grizzled sophomore, Shoppach
takes such praise in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' he said of Smith's comments. ``Hearing that
really means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time high school All-American catcher and two-time
1,000-yard rusher on the Brewer football team who was recruited in
both sports by Division I schools, Shoppach admits he has
encountered more than one shock in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big adjustment,'' he said. ``I'm afraid I didn't handle
it very well. I became confused about my role on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was also confused; he had figured the only thing Shoppach
had to worry about was kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed with him in high school,'' Smith said. ``He
hit .500, he hit home runs, he was the leading rusher, the leading
receiver, he kicked off, punted, returned punts... He was the
leader at everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he graduated, he had almost become a legend. I
remember watching a game at a baseball camp at TCU that summer.
There were several other players sitting in the stands around me,
and I was listening to them. They were whispering to each other,
`Shoppach's here' ... and they were in awe. It was like they just
spotted Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he got here, he seemed to become pessimistic and
melancholy.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Smith launched a drastic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, I sit down with each player one-on-one at the end
of the season,'' he said. ``Usually, it's just a real cheery
have-a-good-summer type deal, but this was a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a dialogue, it was a 10-minute monologue. I told
him bluntly that I was disappointed and felt uncomfortable with the
situation. He was out of shape, gaining weight and seemed to have
no interest in much of anything. When he came in he was smiling;
when he left, he was ... stoic.''
</P>
<P>
   But in retrospect, Smith said, ``I can only hope that in the
future, my own kids respond as well as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppach agrees that those painful 10 minutes probably did
everyone a lot of good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was what I needed,'' he said. ``I want to be a
leader on this team, and I think I can develop into one. It's hard
to do, though, when you're a freshman, and the realization can also
be a little hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the natural thing, and as the catcher, you're in the
obvious position for it. ... So I played summer ball, dropped from
245 to 195, and came back with a better outlook. I'm back up to 215
now (at 5-foot-11), and that's about right.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Shoppach has become adept at handling one of the top
pitching staffs in the nation, emerging victorious from spectacular
home-plate collisions, and playing the way Smith always figured he
would. Probably doesn't even miss football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I think about it,'' he said, grinning. ``Hey, I grew
up in Texas, didn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given the present state of the Bears' football program,
Shoppach has considered becoming a two-sport athlete again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule out the possibility of my playing both at some
point, but right now I'm just concentrating on this game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So are Kenny and Gail Shoppach, his parents. In fact, his dad
recently stretched the concept of ``unwavering support'' to new
heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were driving down to College Station for the opener of
our series with Texas A&AMP;M, and my dad had a heart attack,''
Shoppach said. ``It was what they call a `minor' one _ just some
kind of blockage in the artery, I think, but they had to pull over
in Waco and take him to the hospital. But he recovered quickly, and
when we went to Ole Miss the next weekend, he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, a lot of people are going out of their way to watch
Shoppach. After watching him chase down an errant pitch, wheel, and
throw a Texas runner out at third, Smith called it, ``Probably a
play nobody else could have made, and I thought it was the key play
of the series, because it took them out of a rally and allowed us
to win the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is over. This year, he's been phenomenal.''

RUMORS THAT SUITORS ARE OGLING NABISCO SEND SHARES HIGHER  
 BY KENNETH N. GILPIN  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investor interest perked up noticeably Monday for Nabisco
Holdings, the maker of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, and its
parent, the Nabisco Group.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the price of Nabisco Holdings shares jumped
$2.0625, to $46. And the Nabisco Group, which owns 80.6 percent of
Nabisco Holdings but is saddled with potentially large liabilities
from its days as a tobacco company, rose $3.375, to $23.0625. Fear
of enormous damage awards resulting from class-action lawsuits has
created a wide gap between the price of the food company and its
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Holdings increased in response to an article
in The Wall Street Journal that a number of companies including
Philip Morris, Danone and Cadbury Schweppes had submitted
preliminary bids to buy all or part of the food business. Nabisco
Holdings has directed its management to pursue strategies that
would maximize shareholder return, including a sale of the company.
Many expect the company to be sold by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings has said that no formal deadline exists for the
submission of bids. But it has been widely assumed that interested
parties had until Monday to make a proposal. The process is not
expected to be completed until sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies admitted having submitted an offer. But
analysts said Nabisco's brands would be attractive to a wide range
of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best food asset that has been auctioned in over a
decade, since Kraft was sold'' to Philip Morris, said John
McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Whenever you get
premium assets, you are going to get some interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Kircher, a Philip Morris spokesman, refused to
comment on a possible bid. A spokesman for Cadbury Schweppes also
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where Danone is based, Diane D'Oleon, a spokeswoman,
said the company was in ``preliminary discussions'' with Nabisco
about acquiring assets that fit in with Danone's core mineral
water, dairy products and biscuits businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that of the three, Philip Morris was most likely
to be interested in acquiring all of Nabisco, and was best
positioned financially to swallow the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the deepest pockets,'' said John O'Neil, an analyst
at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is the world's second-biggest packaged food company behind
Nestle. It had sales last year of $26.6 billion, more than three
times the 1999 revenue of Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco's cookie and cracker business, which accounts for about
half of an estimated operating profit of $605 million for this
year, is probably attractive to Danone, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the largest biscuit company in the world without a
presence in the United States,'' said Jaine I. Mehring, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Having just divested their beer
business, they are flush with cash and are down to the three core
businesses that last week they said they are committed to
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Danone's biscuit portfolio includes the Lu and Britannia brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco may also feel comfortable dealing with Danone: In the
early 1990s the French company purchased some international
businesses from what was then RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes is widely assumed to be interested in
Nabisco's confectionary business, especially its LifeSavers and
Breath Savers brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadbury is not a likely buyer of the whole thing,'' O'Neil
said. ``A more likely scenario is that Danone and Cadbury combine
for a bid to split the business, or Danone buying the whole thing
and then selling the confectionary business to Cadbury.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehring said a joint bid was quite possible, and could involve a
company that has not yet expressed an interest. ``I would not be at
all surprised to see a Danone/Nestle bid,'' she said, ``because
Nestle would love LifeSavers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Carl Icahn is the only party interested in Nabisco
that has chosen to openly state his position.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn started the process earlier this year when he offered to
pay $16 a share for the Nabisco Group. It was his fifth bid for the
company in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   In a regulatory filing last week, Icahn said he was willing to
pay $22 a share, or about $6.5 billion, for the holding company.
Currently, he owns just under 10 percent of the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   There has apparently been some interest expressed in Nabisco
Holdings by some financial investors. Recently Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;
Furst, the Dallas-based leveraged buyout firm, was rumored to be
looking for a strategic partner to buy Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Icahn did not seem to have any interest in
owning a food business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Icahn is only interested in buying the holding company,''
O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Icahn is the only visible bidder for the Nabisco Group,
the current wisdom on Wall Street is that he will not end up owning
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The likely winner of an auction for the Nabisco Group is R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   RJR already assumes all of the tobacco-related liability that is
attached to the Nabisco Group. As a consequence, it could buy the
company that it had earlier spun off without assuming any
additional cost or risk. That would likely happen after the food
company was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a sale of the food company, which should be in excess of
$50 a share, RJR could buy the estimated $11 billion in cash held
by the holding company for about $8 billion, a nice benefit to its
current $2.4 billion market cap,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehring from Salomon Smith Barney noted that ``the idea RJR
would be able to profit from its own liability is sort of
laughable.''

HOST PEPPERDINE STILL IN SHOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players discover at this time of season that this isn't a
leisurely day of hitting tennis balls around the court.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NCAAs. You win or you leave.
</P>
<P>
   The USC and UCLA women's teams could stand the pressure.
Pepperdine couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why when Stanford coach Frank Brennan called Pepperdine
officials to discuss logistics Monday, two days after the Waves
were upset by Louisiana State in the regionals, he heard voices
``in a state of shock and despair. It was like a death in the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was especially difficult to accept because Pepperdine
is hosting the last four rounds of the tournament, which begin
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like basketball, when if you've got a guy choking,
you can take him out,'' USC coach Richard Gallien said. ``We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The top six singles and top three doubles teams compete. There
are no substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine coach Gualberto Escudero thought his team was playing
well. He felt even more confident after noticing LSU's lack of
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   No.1 singles Ipek Senoglu hurt her back and pulled a stomach
muscle. As a result, she lost in a third-set tiebreaker to LSU's
top player and lost her doubles match because she had difficulty
moving quickly and had little energy.
</P>
<P>
   No.5 singles player Nadine Rastetter and the No.2 doubles team
of Maren Mueller and Dorothy Kurz unexpectedly lost.
</P>
<P>
   That's four losses right there. LSU won 5-4 _ only one of three
schools to defeat a host, joining Northwestern (over Tulsa) and
Tennessee (over William &AMP; Mary) in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   WHY PEPPERDINE? Because the NCAA wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the Malibu campus has hosted the tennis
championships. The tournament went so well in 1995 that NCAA
officials asked the school to make another bid.
</P>
<P>
   What made it so successful? The location _ Malibu is scenic _
and the number of courts on campus. The school also threw in a team
banquet and an indoor hospitality room with carpeted floors and
television.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no changes this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something they wouldn't forget,'' assistant athletic
director and tournament director Roxanne Levenson said. ``I love
hosting stuff like that. People think I'm crazy for the work
involved. It's a challenge and a reward to watch it come together,
and the athletes appreciate it. That pleases me.'' &QL;

   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ For nearly four hours, Palestinians were
riveted Monday by the spectacle of Israeli troops on Ramallah's
northern outskirts furiously trading automatic-weapon fire with
gunmen _ many of them members of uniformed Palestinian security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games,'' tersely commented a Palestinian officer in the red
beret and camouflage of the military intelligence services. ``Games
between them and us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said a detachment of the Palestinian military
police had initiated the exchange, firing live ammunition from a
hilltop at Israeli troops who had been battling stone-throwing
youths with rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   As the shooting increased, two Israeli Apache helicopters
suddenly swooped into view, detonating aerial flares in loud but
harmless bursts of smoke and light. Crowds of Palestinian
onlookers, mistaking the flares for bombs, scattered in fright.
</P>
<P>
   Then the gunfire abruptly stopped. The Palestinian snipers
decided that they would no longer shoot, knowing that the
helicopters could spot their positions, veterans of Ramallah street
battles patiently explained. The Israelis, too, held their fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that the moment would last, Red Crescent ambulances that
had been trapped on side streets set off for the hospital, sirens
wailing. An independent Palestinian human rights group later said
that 375 people had been wounded _ at least nine seriously _ in
Monday's fighting in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramallah alone, the scene of the fiercest clashes, 150 people
were wounded, the group said. The Israeli army unofficially
reported Monday night that it had killed four Palestinians in armed
exchanges Monday: two in Ramallah and two in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Several Palestinians said that the first live bullet had been
fired at Israelis by rooftop civilian snipers and that the
situation had spiraled out of control when Palestinian troops tried
to forcibly disperse Palestinian demonstrators while Israeli troops
fired rubber bullets at both.
</P>
<P>
   To Nader Nasser, 18, who moved here from Redland, Calif., in the
waning days of the Palestinian uprising known as the intifada eight
years ago, the scene was all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot first,'' he said proudly. ``The Israelis had been
using rubber bullets, but once the live bullets came, they said
that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But to his equally American neighborhood friend, Ashraf Shatat,
also 18, who moved here from Chicago a year and a half ago,
Monday's melee was all new, and disturbing. ``They want to frighten
people,'' he said, gazing up as an Israel chopper crossed low over
the empty Ramallah street. ``Well, it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officials said later that the purpose of the flares
had not been to control the crowd, but to deflect small
heat-seeking missiles _ an indication of the seriousness with which
they viewed the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's violence began as a not uncommon collision between
Israeli troops and Palestinian protesters during an annual march to
lament Israeli independence and demonstrations demanding the
release of Palestinian prisoners. But the showdown evolved into a
diplomatic and political crisis between the Israeli government and
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian security people are supposed be our partners
now,'' grumbled one Israeli intelligence officer. ``Shooting at us
is not within the rules of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fear and anger unleashed by Monday's clashes, an
undeniable air of excitement invigorated Ramallah. Hundreds of
Palestinians _ most of them young men _ crowded nearby streets for
a closer view of the gunfire, with the Israeli soldiers hunkered
down behind armored vans and inside a half-built hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Parked at a gas station not far off, Abdul Razul voiced warm
approval of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the response of the Palestinian people to 52 years of
occupation,'' said Razul, 65, gesturing with a satisfied sweep of
his arms toward the gunfire crackling in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians are getting tired of peace talking,'' he
said. ``The Israelis aren't giving us anything. The Oslo accords
say that they should give us our prisoners, and the Israelis just
keep stalling.''
</P>
<P>
   One young Ramallah policeman, identified as Ahmed Abdel-Fattah,
was killed almost instantly by a burst of Israeli gunfire. At least
six other policemen were wounded _ one critically _ in the gunfire
with Israeli troops, who contend that they were returning fire from
the Palestinian police. Israeli Army officers said three of their
soldiers in Ramallah had been treated for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   During one furious exchange, Maher Abu Khater, a seasoned West
Bank reporter for The Los Angeles Times and the German news agency
DPA, was shot in the back by a distant Palestinian sniper. He was
being treated Monday night in Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem and
was reported to be in stable condition.

RUSSIA FAILS TO ARREST SERBIAN MINISTER IN MOSCOW  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ The Yugoslav defense minister, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic,
who was indicted for war crimes over Kosovo, spent five days on an
official visit to Moscow last week without being arrested by
Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic, who was the Yugoslav army chief of staff in the Kosovo
conflict last year, is generally believed to be the first publicly
indicted Yugoslav official to travel outside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with President Slobodan Milosevic and three other
officials, Ojdanic was indicted a year ago, on May 26, by the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on
charges of crimes against humanity and violation of the laws and
customs of war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council established the tribunal. All member states
of the United Nations are supposed to arrest indicted war criminals
if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Russian press reports printed the day after he left said Ojdanic
arrived on May 7 in Moscow, coinciding with President Vladimir
Putin's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic reportedly met Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and
attended the military parade on May 9 commemorating the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He left Moscow on May 12, after apparently helping prepare for
the visit of Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic of Yugoslavia, who
arrived in Moscow Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the tribunal, Paul Risley, said the chief
prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, was ``alarmed by these reports.'' In a
telephone interview, Risley said del Ponte would ask Moscow about
the reports ``and why a person indicted before the tribunal was not
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been a traditional ally of Yugoslavia and the Serbs
but helped the West negotiate an end to the Kosovo bombing. Russian
troops also serve with U.N. troops in Kosovo.

MICROSOFT REVISES PROGRAM TO PROTECT E-MAIL USERS  
 BY LAWRENCE M. FISHER  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. said Wednesday that it had developed a
software update for its Outlook e-mail program that would reduce
the vulnerability to rogue computer programs like ``I Love You''
and ``Melissa.''
</P>
<P>
   The update will be available free next week from Microsoft's
Office Update Web site (http://officeupdate.microsoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of security holes in Outlook, a rogue software
program, borne by an e-mail message proclaiming ``I Love You,''
propelled itself around the world earlier this month, jamming and
crashing e-mail systems and destroying data on millions of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a worm, the program was traced to a computer student in
the Philippines. The program was activated when a user clicked on
an e-mail attachment and could then be propagated automatically to
e-mail addresses found on the user's computer. Written in
Microsoft's Visual Basic scripting language, the program preyed
particularly on users of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the update would modify Outlook to prevent users
from getting access to several file types that are sent as e-mail
attachments. Those include executables, batch and other files that
contain code often used by hackers to spread viruses. An additional
feature prompts users with a dialog box when an external program
tries to get access to their Outlook address book or send e-mail
messages on their behalf, which is how rogue programs like ``I Love
You'' spread.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sinofsky, senior vice president for Microsoft Office at
Microsoft, said: ``Given the global impact of the `I Love You'
virus and the growing threat of malicious hackers, we strongly
believe we must take the unprecedented step of limiting certain
popular functionality in Outlook to provide a significant,
additional security option for our customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this new security enhancement won't eliminate the threat
of viruses,'' Sinofsky added, ``we believe it can greatly help
eradicate the damaging class of viruses that have resulted in the
`I Love You' and `Melissa' viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Russell, manager of information systems at Security Focus
Inc., said the changes to Outlook would slow, but not stop hackers.
``It certainly does not eliminate the problem, but it slows the
process down and gives people time to react,'' he said. ``That is a
significant win.''
</P>
<P>
   While the update removes two points of entry in Outlook, the
program remains vulnerable, he said. ``I think this will force the
worm writers to go a different route. It will create a little more
of an arms race.''

FRIENDS CONCERNED ABOUT TURNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ Friends of Oakland Raiders safety Eric Turner,
whom sources have confirmed is suffering from intestinal cancer,
are rallying in support of the former UCLA and Ventura High star.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Thursday that Turner, 31, was battling a
stomach disorder that one high-ranking Raiders official described
as ``a terrible, terrible situation.'' Sources later confirmed
Turner had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Turner issued a statement through his agent Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize people are concerned but I have chosen to keep this
issue within my family,''... I am not gravely ill. My family and I
appreciate the thoughts and prayers of my friends and fans. I will
make another statement when my family and I deem it appropriate. We
ask all those involved to please respect the privacy of my family
during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's friends in his hometown of Ventura are expressing
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about Eric Turner the Oakland Raiders football
player, it's about Eric Turner the kid we've known since he was a
kid, and someone I've known since he was in middle school,'' said
Chris Taylor, a Ventura High counselor. ``Everyone here is very
concerned about him and we want to let him know we are here to help
him any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Turner's trouble began spreading after he stopped
showing up at the Ventura County Athletic Club, where he works out
in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came by right after the (NFL) season ended and I thought he
looked a little trim,'' said Shaun Lynch, who plays basketball with
Turner at the gym. ``But that was the last we saw of him, which was
conspicuous because the guy always works out. That was the first
indication that something was wrong. Ever since then it's been one
rumor after another. All I can say is that it's a real drag. We'd
like to help if we can, or at least let him know we are there for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is believed to be at home resting in Westlake Village,
although sources have confirmed he has been in and out of a Ventura
County hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said Turner has remained a friend over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, one day he'll be telling us stories about going to
a Lakers game and talking to Charles Barkley or hanging out with
some of his famous friends, then the next day he's gone for the NFL
season,'' Lynch said. ``But as soon as he gets back and he sees us
he remembers all our names and asks us how things are going and
what's been going on. The fact that he remembers us, just some
regular guys at the gym, tells you a lot about him. He's just a
great guy. I wish him the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner returns home to Ventura every offseason, spending time
with his family and son, Eric Jr. He's also been known to show up
unexpectedly to youth sporting events to show his support.
</P>
<P>
   It never takes long for the kids to notice the 6-foot-3 Turner.
Such was the case last year whn he was home during a Raiders bye
week and stopped to watch a Pop Warner football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out there by himself sitting on the grass just watching
the game, but after a few minutes the kids saw him and before you
knew it there was a big circle of kids around him,'' said Christy
Patterson, whose son Tyler was playing in the game. ``I thought it
was so neat that he stayed there and talked to those kids and
signed autographs for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a nine-year pro who attended UCLA, was the second
overall pick in the 1991 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. He was
selected to the Pro Bowl in 1994 after tying for the NFL lead with
nine interceptions, including one he returned 93 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Turner signed with the Raiders as a free agent before the 1997
season. He led the team in tackles his first year with 111, but was
limited to just six games in 1998 because of a foot injury and
missed the final six games of last season with a calf injury. &QL;

JUSTICES REJECT U.S. LAW ON RAPE VICTIMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a U.S. law
that permitted rape and domestic-violence victims to sue their
attackers in federal court, saying that Congress exceeded its
constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   In their 5-4 ruling, the justices said Congress went too far in
trying to open the courthouse doors to victims by enacting the 1994
Violence Against Women Act. While Congress lacks the authority,
states can and do allow women to seek compensation in local courts
for their physical and emotional injuries and to punish their
attackers financially, the majority said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was the latest in a string of 5-4 decisions
in which the justices ruled the Constitution prohibits Congress
from encroaching on the states' traditional oversight of criminal
matters, including lawsuits against alleged criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a Virginia woman sued two men under the 1994 law,
alleging that they held her down and raped her. The court, while
expressing sympathy for the woman's alleged ordeal, said state law,
not the federal statute, was her sole source for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the allegations here are true, no civilized system of
justice could fail to provide her a remedy,'' Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote in the court's majority opinion. ``But under our
federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of
Virginia and not by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices assailed the court's ruling, saying that
Congress can enable women to sue their attackers as part of a
national effort to curb the immense financial costs of violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which brought the
woman's case to the justices, derided the court for rejecting
Congress' considered decision that victims of violence deserve
their day in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court really substituted its judgment for Congress',''
said Martha Davis, the fund's legal director. ``(It) acted like a
superlegislature to strike down this law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston criminal defense lawyer Kent Schaffer hailed the
ruling, saying the justices properly reined in a congressional
intent on trampling the states' historical authority to deal with
violent crime within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the federal government's theory, they can take any
criminal act and turn it into a federal offense,'' said Schaffer,
immediate past president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, you're going to be seeing people in federal
prison for driving while intoxicated,'' he added sardonically.
``Not everything should be criminalized to the nth degree.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; With its decision, the high court threw out Christy Brzonkala's
lawsuit against then-Virginia Tech students Antonio Morrison and
James Crawford, whom she alleged raped her in September 1994.
Virginia never prosecuted Morrison and Crawford for the alleged
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The school concluded that Morrison had violated its
abusive-conduct policy and required him to attend a one-hour
session with an equal-opportunity compliance officer. Virginia Tech
found no evidence on which to punish Crawford. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The court, in ruling the federal law invalid, said Congress
could point to no constitutional provision that gives federal
lawmakers the authority to permit women to sue their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices likened the case to its 1995 decision striking down
the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which banned firearms around
schools. In both cases, the high court, by identical votes of 5-4,
said the national laws encroached on the authority of states to
punish local crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, as it had tried to do in the school
zones case, argued that the Violence Against Women Act is a valid
exercise of Congress' constitutional authority to regulate and
protect interstate commerce. By allowing women to sue their
attackers, Congress is trying to discourage these assaults and the
subsequent $3 billion to $5 billion drain on the U.S. economy, as
victims often miss work and refuse to leave their homes, the
administration argued.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, said the fact that violence also imposes
economic harm does not enable Congress to trample on the states'
sole authority to decide when its residents can take legal action.
If Congress could make a federal case out of every event that
affects interstate commerce, divorces could be heard by a U.S.
judge because they influence the national economy, the justices
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because Congress may conclude that a particular
activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not
necessarily make it so,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``Rather, whether
particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to
come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is
ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question and can be
settled finally only by this court.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. and chief sponsor of the
anti-violence law, said the court has gone too far in favoring
states' rights over congressional authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has become bolder and bolder in stripping
the federal government of the ability to make decisions on behalf
of the American people,'' Biden said. ``Congress, and not the
courts, should have the primary responsibility for striking the
right balance between state and federal power.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said the law is needed to stem the national epidemic of
violence against women by enlisting U.S. prosecutors and courts in
helping to stop attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides permitting victims to sue, the statute contains criminal
provisions and sections calling for federal funding of
anti-violence programs. The criminal and funding parts of the law
were not at issue in the case, U.S. vs. Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the high court also rejected the
administration's argument that the Constitution's equal protection
clause gives Congress broad authority to allow women to sue their
attackers. The administration said state courts have historically
denied women equal protection by failing to treat female assault
victims as seriously as they treat men.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the equal protection clause gives Congress
the authority to regulate states, not individuals. The
constitutional provision does not allow Congress to give private
citizens the right to sue other private citizens, as it did under
the Violence Against Women Act, Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rehnquist's opinion were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice David H. Souter predicted that
the court's narrow reading of Congress' authority will eventually
be overruled by future justices more attuned to the relationship
between violent crime and interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence against women may be found to affect interstate
commerce and affect it substantially,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Souter's dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

AS VOTE ON TRADE BILL NEARS, UNCOMMITTED FEEL PRESSURE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Mass., Maine, Mich., Neb.)   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An influential senior House Democrat from New York
signaled Monday that he is leaning in favor of a decisive China
trade bill, as the measure's supporters and opponents geared up for
a furious week of lobbying before next week's scheduled vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways
and Means Committee, said in a telephone interview that he is still
officially undecided on a measure to grant China permanent normal
trading privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But then Rangel challenged several of the opponents' main
arguments. ``I don't understand why labor would make this their
litmus test on human rights or give a priority to human rights in
China when there are so many problems in the U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether the World Trade Organization could
adequately police Chinese trade violations once Beijing joined the
international body, as is expected, Rangel said, ``If we have no
leverage in the WTO, what do we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor and the Clinton administration have heavily
courted Rangel, in part because they believe he may influence the
votes of at least two other members of the congressional Black
Caucus, Gregory W. Meeks of New York and Eva M. Clayton of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said he still wanted to discuss the measure with fellow
Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee before the panel meets on
Wednesday to vote on the measure. Approval by the pro-trade
committee is considered all but certain.
</P>
<P>
   One factor Rangel said he is weighing is how the China vote will
affect labor's support for Democrats in the November elections. If
Democrats reclaim the House, Rangel would become the committee's
first black chairman. ``We need labor's enthusiastic support,''
Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a significant lift for the Clinton administration Monday,
the United States International Trade Commission voted to levy
punitive anti-dumping duties on apple juice concentrate imports
from China. The administration is trying to convince lawmakers that
it can regulate trade with China to make sure that American
producers are not swamped by Chinese imports produced at prices
deemed below cost.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-0 ruling by the trade commission imposes a 52 percent duty
on Chinese apple juice concentrate. It backs up a ruling by the
Commerce Department, which determined last month that China was
selling the juice concentrate in the American market for about half
of what it cost to produce.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Monday, the spokesman Joe Lockhart said
President Clinton will hold individual meetings this week with many
of the undecided lawmakers _ about 25 to 30 in both the Democratic
and Republican camps _ and step up a campaign that has involved
Clinton, Vice President Gore and Cabinet members who are calling
wavering legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks has already felt the brunt of the lobbying onslaught. The
freshman Democrat said he heard Clinton's most persuasive arguments
while he and a handful of other uncommitted lawmakers flew aboard
Air Force One last week after the funeral of Cardinal John
O'Connor. But labor leaders have also buttonholed Meeks, whose
district includes Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been intense,'' Meeks told Reuters. ``Any number of labor
leaders have called and continue to call, even when I was at
Cardinal O'Connor's funeral. There were a few labors who came up to
me and said, `We need your vote. We want to talk to you some
more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many state governors are also turning up the pressure, including
the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Paul Cellucci, who is
lobbying three undecided House Democrats from his state: Martin T.
Meehan, Richard E. Neal and Edward J. Markey.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcheting up pressure from business groups, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce on Wednesday will launch a new radio campaign targeting
about 10 undecided and opposed lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also planned a week of rallies and counter-advertising
campaigns. Rep. John Baldacci, D-Maine, said Monday he would vote
against the measure ``absent serious and substantive'' parallel
legislation that permits congressional oversight of China's
compliance with trade and other international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders are to meet on Tuesday to weigh such a
bill sponsored by Reps. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., and Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb. Their bill would create a commission to monitor
Chinese compliance and would have a provision to protect against a
surge of imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders fear the measure may cost more votes on
the floor than it will gain.

U.S. PLANNED NUCLEAR BLAST ON THE MOON, PHYSICIST SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: N.M., Ill.)  By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States weighed a plan to detonate a nuclear bomb on
the moon as a show of military and technical strength during the
feverish post-Sputnik days of the Cold War, a physicist involved in
the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The physicist, Leonard Reiffel, 72, said Monday that he was in
charge of a highly classified study of the blast's visibility, its
possible scientific benefits and its effects on the moon's surface.
His research got under way in 1958, sponsored by the Air Force
special weapons center in Albuquerque, N.M., and involved up to 10
people on his staff, including Carl Sagan, then a young astronomer
and later the popularizer of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess
of the United States,'' Reiffel said in an interview. ``It was a PR
device, without question, in the minds of the people from the Air
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear flash would have been widely visible from Earth, he
said, and would have produced a lunar crater and dust cloud that,
because of the moon's lack of atmosphere, would have flown out in
all directions rather than in the usual mushroom shape.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel said the plan called for an explosive device about the
size of the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima. The Air Force ruled
out a hydrogen bomb, he said, because of the difficulty of flying
the heavier weapon 235,000 miles to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   He said the project ended when Air Force officials decided its
risks outweighed its benefits. A spokesman said the Air Force would
not comment until it could review records.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel said the Air Force plan was seen as a way to bolster
national confidence after the Soviet Union launched the world's
first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit in October 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had a hard time catching up, exploding many
rockets and succeeding in orbiting a satellite in January 1958 that
weighed just 10.5 pounds. National esteem was low for years,
because much of the world assumed that the Soviets could launch a
nuclear weapon at the United States but that the United States was
unable to reply.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel said his research was done at the Armour Research
Foundation in Chicago, which did work for the Air Force and is now
part of the Illinois Institute of Technology. He was the head of
physics for the foundation and also led the secret study.
</P>
<P>
   From May 1958 to January 1959, his team reported on blast
considerations and likely effects, Reiffel said, including the
visual differences if the moon's face was illuminated by the sun or
darkened in shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel made his role in the project public in a letter in the
May 4 issue of the journal Nature. The letter addressed the bomb
study and Sagan's role. He said he had Sagan investigate whether
the blast could be used to identify the presence of organic
molecules on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the Soviet Union became the first nation to crash a
probe into the moon. After several failures, the United States did
so in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel said his team had no responsibility for the project's
moon rocket. But it was to have been an Air Force intercontinental
ballistic missile, he said, which had enough range. The United
States began deploying ICBM's in October 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these things go, this was small,'' Reiffel said of the bomb
project. ``It was less than a year and never got to the point of
operational planning. We showed what some of the effects might be.
But the real argument we made, and others made behind closed doors,
was that there was no point in ruining the pristine environment of
the moon. There were other ways to impress the public that we were
not about to be overwhelmed by the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel said he worked with the physicist Enrico Fermi at the
University of Chicago and later was a deputy director of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the early
Apollo program.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel's letter was in response to a review of ``Carl Sagan: A
Life'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1999) by Keay Davidson, which sketched
out some of Sagan's involvement in the bomb project. The book said
Sagan had broken security in March 1959 to inform a potential
patron about the secret work, but a reviewer disparaged that
finding.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reiffel agreed with Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to set the record straight,'' Reiffel said. ``There
would have been an outcry if the project had been made public.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The 13 people who were killed by two students at
Columbine High School last year were shot within the first 16
minutes of the siege as the authorities were still assessing the
situation, according to a report issued Monday by the Jefferson
County Sheriff. But it was more than 40 minutes after the shooting
began that the police entered the building, and hours before some
victims were found or rescued.
</P>
<P>
   As the first detailed account of the shootings, the report
offers a timeline that purports to show exactly what happened at
the school on April 20, 1999, when two students carried out a
carefully planned mission in which they hoped to kill hundreds of
students and staff members with guns and homemade bombs. Most of
the bombs did not go off, but the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, succeeded in shooting to death 12 students and a teacher
and wounding 23 other students before they turned their weapons on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of the report _ a CD-ROM that includes text,
photographs, sound recordings and video from surveillance cameras _
the presentation leaves unanswered many fundamental questions about
what drove the two teen-agers to carry out one of the worst mass
shootings in America. Nor did it try to interpret motives from
videotapes the teen-agers made a month before the killings in which
they expressed universal hatreds and showed off their formidable
arsenal of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, as Steve Davis, a spokesman for Sheriff John P. Stone,
said Monday, the purpose of the report was only to reconstruct the
movements of the killers, their victims and the authorities on the
scene. The report made no judgments about the authorities' actions,
which has become a major issue for many families of victims who
feel the authorities did not act fast enough to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which the authorities said was based on 4,500
interviews and more than 10,000 pieces of evidence, included no
major revelations. At the same time, however, it dispelled several
rumors, including the possibility of a third shooter or that anyone
at the school had been accidentally shot by the police.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also reveals how perplexed and uncertain the law
enforcement officers were in responding, especially in the early
minutes, when conflicting information relayed through a barrage of
911 calls left them unsure what they were encountering. For
example, early reports said a shooter was on the roof of the
school, which was not the case. The person on the roof was an air
conditioning repairman, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, as the report reflected, was the number of
agencies responding _ city, county and state _ with little
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the killers take over our school,'' said Judy Brown,
the mother of a Columbine student, expressing anger and frustration
over the police response. ``They stood outside. They let this
happen. They let it continue. They should've gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the report is the chronology, starting with the
times Harris and Klebold, wearing long black coats to conceal their
weapons, arrived at school and, at 11:17 a.m., planted two duffel
bags in the cafeteria, each containing ``enough explosive power to
kill the majority of students who soon would be arriving'' for
lunch. Afterward, they returned to their cars, which were also
rigged with bombs, to await the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities found that ``blending in with 400 other
backpacks and bags scattered throughout the cafeteria,'' made the
duffel bags virtually indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Neither those bombs nor ones in the cars ever went off. But
another did, on a nearby field planned as a diversion, prompting
the first emergency call at 11:19.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Harris and Klebold, standing at the school's
west steps, made their move, the report said. One of them said,
``Go, go,'' and they pulled out shotguns and began shooting ,
killing Rachel Scott and injuring Richard Castaldo, who had been
sitting on the grass together. Within seconds, at least eight more
students were shot, including Daniel Rohrbough, who died. A witness
heard one of the gunmen shout, ``This is what we always wanted to
do. This is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It would still be four more minutes, at 11:23, before the first
law enforcement officer, Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner, arrived at
the school, where calm had turned to chaos inside with loud
explosions, smoke and students cowering in fear. Harris spotted the
deputy and the two exchanged fire before Harris retreated inside
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four minutes, the gunmen walked down hallways,
``firing weapons,'' the report said, adding ``both are laughing.''
Another student and a teacher, Dave Sanders, were shot in a
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen continued shooting at random targets, the report
said, and tossing bombs as they walked toward the library, where
they shot and killed another 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, they had been inside the school only seven and a
half minutes, while, outside, officers were scrambling to assess
the situation. According to the chronology, even after Harris and
Klebold had killed all but themselves, the authorities were only
beginning to amass _ to nearly 1,000 by later in the day _ and none
had entered the school.
</P>
<P>
   The final moments of carnage were almost surreal, as the report
described them. By then, many students had escaped from the school.
The gunmen left the library, making their way toward the science
area, shooting aimlessly and tossing bombs, some exploding. The
report said, ``Their behavior now seems directionless.''
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the cafeteria, where some students were still
hiding. Harris shot several times into the duffel bag left earlier,
but the bomb did not detonate. Then, the report said, ``The
suspects both take a moment to drink from water bottles left by
students on the school lunch tables.'' A witness later told the
authorities that one of them said, ``Today, the world's going to
come to an end. Today's the day we die.'' It was 11:44.  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 24 minutes, as the authorities were still
grappling with the magnitude of events and beginning to get medical
attention to those shot outside the school, the killers roamed
inside with no apparent purpose, finally returning to the library,
where Deputy Kevin Walker ``sees a muzzle flash'' from a window.
</P>
<P>
   That flash, the authorities determined, was the gunfire the
killers turned on themselves. By then, they had fired 188 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 141 times mainly in exchanges before the
gunmen entered the school and as the boys leaned out windows of the
building and fired at officers.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 12:06, several minutes after the suicides, that
the first officers, a SWAT team of five, entered the building. But
almost 25 minutes passed before a second team entered to assist
them.
</P>
<P>
   By then, medical authorities had begun to reach some of the
injured students, more people were evacuated and SWAT teams began a
methodical search of the school. The authorities were still being
warned of possible bombs in the school, but the building was
gradually secured even though some injured students, including Pat
Ireland, who climbed out of a second-floor window at 2:38, were not
rescued until several hours after the shooting stopped. Rescuers
did not reach Sanders, the teacher, until 2:42, when they found him
gravely wounded. But medical personnel could not reach him, and he
was pronounced dead more than two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first SWAT team did not reach the library until
3:22. Besides the dead, officers found at least two other students
who were injured, as well as the teacher, Patti Nielson, who had
made the first 911 call. Nielson was found hiding in a small room
in the library.
</P>
<P>
   It will, no doubt, be left to the growing number of lawsuits to
sort out other details about the siege. So far, 15 families have
sued Jefferson County, alleging negligence by the sheriff's
department for not intervening faster. Also, Gov. Bill Owens of
Colorado has appointed a special commission to investigate the
incident, giving it a much wider mandate than Stone had for his
report, including why the killers' motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably what we really want is not going to be in there,''
said Connie Michalik, whose son, Richard Castaldo, was injured by
gunfire. ``What we really wanted was why they didn't do more to
prevent it before it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shoeles, whose son Isaiah was killed, has been highly
critical of the sheriff's department. He repeated his call for a
federal investigation and said Monday from his home in Houston:
``The truth is not in that report. Bring people in here who did not
botch the investigation.''

PANEL FEARS SECURITY AT LABS HURTS FOREIGN HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A panel of scientists and engineers who advise the president and
Congress issued a statement Monday expressing concern that
heightened security measures at federal laboratories appear to be
damaging their ability to hire and retain foreign-born and minority
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   If the laboratories could not attract those scientists, who make
up a large portion of the technical talent in the United States, it
could threaten the labs' abilities to perform tasks as as diverse
as ensuring the safety of the nuclear stockpile and cleaning up
toxic wastes, said the panel, the National Science Board.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson immediately disputed the
board's contention that the security measures are behind the
laboratories' hiring difficulties, pointing instead to ``an
atmosphere of fear'' generated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which runs the labs, ``is doing its best
to strike the proper balance between protecting that which
legitimately requires protection while encouraging the openness
that science requires,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, was arrested and charged with mishandling nuclear
secrets more than a year ago. Rules involving close scrutiny of
scientists' contact with foreign nationals, polygraph tests and
limitations on scientific collaborations have been imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the measures have been criticized as needlessly
intrusive and unfairly burdensome to Asian and Asian-American
scientists at the laboratories, allegedly creating a hostile and
discriminatory workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a serious one, since, for example, more than a
quarter of all doctorates in technical fields awarded in the United
States each year are given to Asians or Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the National Science Board, which also
governs the National Science Foundation, said that the security
concerns at the labs have led to a ``growing difficulty'' in
attracting foreign-born and minority scientists ``because of
perceptions based on nationality, ethnicity, or other
characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eamon Kelly, president emeritus of Tulane University and
chairman of the science board, said that ``there's an accumulation
of evidence that the current environment is becoming a detriment to
the hiring of foreign-born and minority American scientists. This
can have an impact on the integrity of the scientific process,
which would be detrimental both to our national security and our
economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while the board was mindful of suspicion
surrounding Asian scientists at federal laboratories, its concerns
went further, covering all foreign-born scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also placed a moratorium on visits to the labs by
scientists from numerous countries, except when special waivers are
granted by Richardson. An Energy Department official said that the
routine paperwork generated by the security rules was ``overlaid
with this sense of suspicion'' only because of the intrusion of
needless restrictions imposed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that the security requirements by themselves did
not discourage international collaborations or intimidate lab
scientists. Rather, he said, ``it is Congress, by creating an
atmosphere of fear, that has caused concerns among the foreign-born
scientists.''

BUSH, GORE OFFER DIFFERENT APPROACHES ON SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>

and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush told California senior citizens that
Americans should be allowed to invest part of their Social Security
payroll tax in the stock market. Vice President Al Gore told
Pennsylvania college students that the government retirement plan
is a ``solemn compact'' that should not be risked on the vagaries
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate broke much new ground Monday, but their
speeches on opposite ends of the country underscored Social
Security's place as a central issue in the 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the probable Republican presidential nominee, discussed
his vision for Social Security with a gathering of senior citizens
in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing his opponents of tactics that ``frighten the elderly
for political advantage,'' Bush promised a bipartisan redesign of
Social Security and Medicare if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here with a message for America and to put my opponent on
notice: The days of spreading fear and panic are over,'' Bush said
to an audience of of about 100 at the Rancho Cucamonga Senior
Center. ``When I am elected, this generation and this president
will save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the apparent Democratic nominee, cited a ``fundamental
difference'' between him and his GOP rival, accusing Bush of trying
to create a ``system of winners and losers'' with his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Beaver College in suburban Philadelphia, Gore
advocated shoring up the retirement system by plowing money into it
from the projected federal budget surplus and from the savings
generated by paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   He said this infusion would keep the system solvent into the
middle of the century. The vice president has rejected a major
overhaul of Social Security. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Gore campaign clearly believes that voters will be wary of
the risks of investing their basic government retirement money in
the stock market. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bush is trying to stake out a reform position on a pair of
issues _ Social Security and Medicare _ that Democrats have used in
recent years to drive a wedge between elderly voters and
Republicans. But he said his interest goes beyond politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior Americans are not one more interest group, as far as
I'm concerned, not one more voting bloc to be polled, pandered to,
or written off,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the only way to save Social Security and Medicare
for future generations is to put part of each of the government
programs into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gore countered that privatization would be too risky because it
would no longer guarantee younger people that when they retired
they would receive a set amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently sympathetic to Gore's position was the message on a
banner towed behind an airplane circling the senior center where
Bush spoke: ``Don't Privities (sic) Social Security;
WWW.2030.org.''
</P>
<P>
   The group with that Internet address describes itself as a
``public policy organization for young adults'' with a mission to
``advocate for the economic interest of young workers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Social Security system will go bankrupt by 2037 if
nothing is done to change it because more people will be collecting
benefits than are paying into it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore has a simplistic approach to the problem that
``will eventually require either a 25 percent increase in income
taxes _ the largest in our nation's history _ or a substantial
reduction in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   While offering few specifics of his own plan, Bush promised that
no current retiree or anyone near retirement would have benefits
changed under any reform he would sign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wants to ``lock box'' the current Social Security
surplus to be used only within the Social Security system. He
promised that payroll taxes would not be increased. The program he
proposes, he said, would preserve disability and survivor
components of the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed that a bipartisan commission design a plan to
allow individuals on a voluntary basis to invest a portion of their
Social Security payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the real return people get from what they put into
Social Security is a dismal two percent a year,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey said an individual could
earn 4 percent just by investing in government bonds that are
adjusted for inflation, and he said long-term investing in the
stock market has had a return of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said Bush's plan was economically unsound
because of the transition cost necessary to continue paying seniors
current benefits as younger people diverted their payroll taxes
into the stock market. The vice president estimated that cost to be
as high as $1 trillion. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lindsey said a portion of any increased earnings would be
returned to the system to keep it solvent. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He acknowledged that an unspecified amount of money from the
federal government's general tax fund would be required to support
Social Security during a transition phase from the old program to
the new program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said investing a portion of Social Security into stock
markets would be no more risky than the investment approach now
used by many business and teacher retirement plans, which invest in
diversified portfolios often including stocks. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gore said that while there is nothing inherently wrong with
encouraging people to invest in the stock market, Social Security
was never intended to be a high-risk investment scheme. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Social Security is a solemn compact between the generations.
It is a basic guarantee of retirement security based on a
guaranteed minimum benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have to roll the dice with your basic Social
Security,'' he said, and added that Bush would ``turn the Social
Security system into a system of winners and losers. We will be
jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that Bush, in comments quoted Monday in the Dallas
Morning News, would not guarantee that future Social Security
beneficiaries would receive at least what they would have under the
current system. When asked about such guarantees the governor
replied ``maybe, maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush admits that his plan takes the security out of
Social Security,'' Gore said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But in expanding on Bush's proposal for a bipartisan effort to
redesign the system, Lindsey said that any of six different private
investing plans floated by various Democratic and Republican
lawmakers would keep the system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 Congress members who have endorsed those plans are
Sen. Phil Gramm and U.S. Rep. Bill Archer of Houston, both
Republicans, and Rep. Charles Stenholm of Stamford, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also advocated a bipartisan approach to improving Medicare,
the federal health insurance program for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush in the past has voiced support for a Medicare reform plan
outlined by a bipartisan commission last year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would extend Medicare coverage through the Federal
Employees Health Insurance Program but also would open more private
markets for alternative health care coverage. Medicare would cover
the cost for low-income individuals, but upper-income individuals
who want improved coverage would have to pay additional premiums to
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   The plan died in Congress last year because of a lack of support
from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 elections, Democrats ran television commercials
attacking Republicans over protecting Medicare. The GOP referred
the ads as ``Mediscare,'' designed to motivate elderly voters
through fear.

SOME THINGS BETTER LEFT UNSAID IN LAKERLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Phil Jackson didn't want to say the wrong
thing Sunday, so he said nothing at all. Or, at least, very little.
To his team, and to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A 117-98 loss to the Phoenix Suns had him steamed, so Jackson
kept his halftime and postgame speeches to a minimum. But he did
not avoid the locker room, as some reports indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much you can say in a situation like that,'' he
said. ``Every individual on our team had lapses. ... I mean, you
point one finger, you've got three coming-back-at-yourself type of
thing. So it's better off left unsaid sometimes, and then in a
cooler moment, when you've had a chance to analyze some things,
it's important to then reason with people. And I think that
reasoning takes better, there's more growth that happens from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE CLARIFYING: Jackson said he meant no disrespect to the Suns
by calling two timeouts in the final 18.4 seconds of Sunday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in a game which has been completely ruined for the
viewing audience, it's very important that I get a timeout, because
there's a commercial that I have that might get a chance to run at
that particular time,'' Jackson quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he disagreed with what he termed an
``inconsequential'' foul called on John Salley, and called the
timeout in protest _ ``just to prove a point.'' Suns coach Scott
Skiles called a retaliatory timeout, and Jackson called one more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix, in their own mindset, thought I was insulting them,
which is totally different than what I intended to do,'' Jackson
said. ``But Skiles is hard-headed, so we came back with our own
plan (another timeout) to get that commercial in for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   UNCLARIFYING: Rick Fox left the Lakers' practice site without
speaking to reporters, so it's still a mystery why he intentionally
fouled Clifford Robinson twice late in the fourth quarter, drawing
two technical fouls and an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said referee Joey Crawford, who assessed the technicals,
``jumped the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey said he didn't want anything to happen during the game
which would make a situation flare up,'' Jackson said, ``and so you
have to give him the judgment call. But then again it's Rick Fox,
it's not some hothead, (New York's Chris) Childs or somebody else
that's known for doing that kind of thing. ... I think the
frustration got to him, and there it went.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's frustration might have stemmed from the fact he played
only two minutes in the second half, behind rookie Devean George.
Jackson figured the athletic George could slow up Shawn Marion and
gain some playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick may have registered it wrong,'' Jackson said, ``but he
didn't want to talk about it after the game, so I didn't belabor
the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing on his Web site, Fox was vague about his motives, but he
apologized to fans and said, ``I hope they don't charge me for some
of the stuff I broke in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE TIME: After the Lakers lost twice to Sacramento in the
first round, Ron Harper predicted, correctly, a victory in Game 5.
He was back at it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win tomorrow's game,'' he said. ``No doubt in
my mind. Ain't no guarantee, but we're going to win tomorrow
night's game. ... I will stick by my words.'' &QL;

FINE SUGGESTED FOR KAISER OPERATIONS  &HT;     BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The state agency that regulates health plans says Kaiser Permanente
should be fined $1 million for failures in providing basic health
care, including emergency services, at its Hayward facility.
<P>
   The state Department of Corporations' recommendation, which
would be one of the biggest fines ever levied against an HMO,
revolved around the death of a 74-year-old San Leandro woman.
Margaret Utterback died in 1996 after a blood vessel ruptured
minutes after she was admitted to Kaiser's Hayward emergency room.
The DOC said Utterback had spent more than eight hours on the phone
and in person trying to see her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stewart, spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations,
said investigators found that the patient screening system made it
difficult for Utterback to speak to a doctor or a nurse. ``It's a
major case that uncovered systematic problems that created barriers
to care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser spokeswoman Lila Petersen said the Oakland-based HMO
would ``vigorously contest'' the DOC accusations. ``We have a lot
of empathy for the family that suffered a terrible loss,'' she
said. ``There are some issues here specific to this case, but this
is not a systematic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOC recommendation will now be referred to an administrative
law judge, who will review the state investigation and decide
whether to uphold, reverse or modify the findings. That decision,
however, may be challenged by the department or Kaiser and the case
could end up in the state courts.
</P>
<P>
   But to Terry Preston, youngest of Utterback's five children, and
the one who has spent the past four years urging the state to act,
the DOC decision late Friday evening came as a vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deadline for state action expired on Mother's Day,'' said
Preston. ``Someone up there more powerful than me was working on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   An 18-page DOC report details how Utterback, a Kaiser patient
for 50 years, woke on January 26, 1996 with severe abdominal pain.
Around 8:30 a.m., she called Kaiser seeking an appointment with her
doctor, Kaiser physician Rod Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Utterback, assisted by another daughter, Barbara
Winnie of San Ramon, repeatedly tried to get in to see Perry, but
was rebuffed by the people who handled incoming phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 2:00 p.m., they were told the doctor could see
Utterback at 4:15 p.m., according to the report. Hoping to get in
sooner, Winnie drove Utterback to Kaiser's Point Eden clinic about
2:30 p.m., where they waited for two hours before Perry could see
them.
</P>
<P>
   When the doctor did see Utterback, the state report said, he
immediately and correctly diagnosed that her main abdominal blood
vessel was in imminent danger of bursting. The report also said
that Perry initially suggested that Winnie drive her mother to the
Kaiser emergency room about 1.5 miles away, but soon rescinded that
recommendation and ordered an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report said, Perry did not put Utterback on
intravenous medications to calm her and lower her blood pressure,
even though this is supposed to be standard practice for this
condition and a nurse twice recommended it be done.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ambulance got Utterback to the emergency room
about 5:15 p.m., the blood vessel &UR;  &LR; burst and blood began flooding
into her abdominal cavity, the report said. Doctors were unable to
staunch the bleeding or replace the lost fluid despite giving her
24 pints of transfused blood, the report said. She died about 36
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Madvig, associate director for quality at
Kaiser-Permanente, called Utterback's death ``a terrible
situation'' with ``a terrible outcome,'' but disputed many of the
state's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Madvig said that Utterback had been told to go to the emergency
room earlier, but had insisted on seeing Perry, her personal
physician. He said once Perry did see Utterback, the doctor made
the proper diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medical Board of California reviewed this case some time
ago and did not make any adverse findings,'' Madvig said. Perry has
left Kaiser since this incident, but Madvig characterized that as a
''personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Madvig said Kaiser has made some changes at its Hayward facility
that make it easier for patients to see a medical professional if
they complain of pain while waiting for a doctor's appointment. He
also said Kaiser is also providing callers with more access to
nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Madvig said Kaiser would present its side of the case before the
administrative law judge, who will review the DOC's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Preston, the daughter who kept the case alive with state
investigators, said she persisted in her efforts because Kaiser
refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wouldn't talk to me because I might sue them;''
said Preston, who has not retained an attorney and says she has no
plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't enough money in the world to compensate for my
mother's loss,'' she said. ``I really believe you can make a
stronger impact'' going through state laws designed to assure the
quality of health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the DOC spokeswoman, said she could recall one other
fine larger than the proposed Kaiser penalty, but said she did not
have a record of all the fines the department has levied.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamie Court, a health care activist with Consumers for
Quality Care in Santa Monica, said that according to his records,
the proposed DOC penalty would be as large as all 41 fines that the
DOC has assessed against California health plans since 1996.

CALPERS REJECTS PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING NATIONS  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
For more than a year, the California Public Employees Retirement
System has been trying to come up with a better way to decide which
developing countries are safe and potentially profitable enough to
invest in.
<P>
   The giant pension fund's investment staff finally came up with a
plan, based entirely on economic criteria, and was hoping the
CalPERS board would approve it at their meeting in Sacramento
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was shot down, mainly by State Treasurer Phil
Angelides and other board members appointed by Gov. Gray Davis who
want CalPERS to invest in countries that are socially and
politically correct as well as economically sound.
</P>
<P>
   The staff was essentially told to go back to the drawing board
(negotiating table is more like it) and come back in August with a
plan that includes some sort of social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this battle will affect every current and former
state worker who's counting on a pension from CalPERS, anyone who
cares about human rights abroad, and big state pension funds that
follow CalPERS' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it could affect U.S. companies in which CalPERS
invests. Angelides yesterday proposed requiring CalPERS' corporate
governance staff to ``monitor'' American companies ``and seek, as a
shareholder, to improve the corporate practices of the companies
doing business in the emerging markets in which it invests.''
</P>
<P>
   After State Controller and CalPERS board member Kathleen Connell
put up a big fuss about how that proposal would affect California
companies, Angelides agreed to put it on hold until CalPERS can
first figure out  &LR; where  &LR; it wants to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The staff's biggest blunder was basing its list of
``permissible'' countries in part on ratings developed by the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage rates countries based on their ``economic freedom,''
which includes factors such as trade policy, government
intervention, property rights and wages.
</P>
<P>
   At least four labor unions representing state workers last week
shot off to Michael Flaherman, chairman of the CalPERS investment
committee, saying they were ``alarmed'' or ``appalled'' to discover
that the staff was taking its cues from Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heritage Foundation promotes a hard-right, anti-worker
agenda. Heritage opposes minimum wage increases and child labor
laws,'' wrote Robert Balgenorth, president of the State Building
and Construction Trades Council of California.
</P>
<P>
   The unions preferred a plan from Angelides, which would have
excluded countries that don't uphold democracy, worker rights and a
free press. The Angelides plan was based in part on country ratings
developed by the Freedom House, a liberal think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom House list would exclude six countries permissible
under the Heritage criteria: Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Peru and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides believes that political and social freedom leads to
long-term economic growth. ``There is not a disassociation between
political stability and economic performance,'' he told me during a
break in the action yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But the CalPERS staff cited several studies that show ``linkages
between political and electoral freedom and future growth are weak
or do not exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It noted, for example, that Heritage rates Singapore as one of
the most economically free nations, while Freedom rates it as only
``partly free.'' On the other hand, India is rated ``free'' by
Freedom House and ``mostly unfree'' by Heritage. Yet Singapore has
been far more economically successful than India.
</P>
<P>
   Both the staff and the Angelides proposals would consider
financial criteria such as market liquidity, market regulation,
market openness and transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two sides really boils down to this:
How do you best promote human rights and economic growth _ from
within the country or from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to child labor, slavery and violation of basic
human rights,'' said board member Charles Valdes. But the best way
to correct those injustices is ``through a policy of inclusion
rather than exclusion. The worst way ... is to pick up your marbles
and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions felt otherwise. Human-rights violations in developing
nations ``are so abhorrent'' that state workers should not be
putting any money into them, said Dave Low, assistant director of
the California School Employees Association. ``Our exposure is not
so huge that we can't find alternative investments.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; REAL ESTATE.COM: The CalPERS board had a much easier time
dealing with two other proposals. With little discussion, it agreed
to explore investments in agricultural land, and commit $500
million to tech-oriented commercial real estate in cities such as
San Jose, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS wants to own enough buildings so that it can give
fast-growing tech companies the ability to move from office to
office or to tear up leases. In addition to the usual rents,
CalPERS ``would expect warrants, options or stock'' in tenant
companies, said Mark Albertson, CalPERS portfolio manager.

S.F.'S WILLIAMS-SONOMA TO NAME NEW LEADER  &HT;     BY CAROL EMERT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco's Williams-Sonoma Inc. has settled a long-standing
succession question by naming its head merchant, Gary Friedman,
president of the company.
<P>
   Friedman, 42, is now in line to assume the retailer's reins from
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Howard Lester, 64. An
announcement is planned for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lester was treated for prostate cancer in 1997, although he is
now healthy, he said in a telephone interview Monday.
Williams-Sonoma has not had a companywide president since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who had been chief merchandising officer and president
of the stores division, is credited with revitalizing both the
Williams-Sonoma kitchenwares business and its home-furnishings
chain, Pottery Barn, since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With its stable of strong brands sold via catalog, stores and
the Internet, Williams-Sonoma has become a powerhouse in the
home-goods sector. Sales have doubled since the mid-1990s, hitting
$1.4 billion in 1999. This year, the company forecasts revenues of
$1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street sources cautioned that Friedman has little
background in back-end operations, a crucial aspect of retailing,
in which the company has experienced significant problems in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In another management change to be announced today, Pat
Connolly, 53, was promoted to chief marketing officer from
executive vice president. Connolly and several other top managers
will now report to Friedman instead of Lester.
</P>
<P>
   The management changes are designed to help Williams-Sonoma
leverage its brands across all channels of distribution, Friedman
said in an interview yesterday. Previously, Friedman ran the
stores, while Connolly ran the direct-to-consumer division, which
includes catalogs, the Internet and book and magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more synergistic merchandising and brand messaging in
all the formats,'' Friedman said, adding that by expanding ways to
connect with its customers, the company ``will make our brands more
powerful, relevant, authoritative.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester said he is confident that Williams-Sonoma's operational
side can be handled by Chief Financial Officer John Tate and
supply-chain manager Duane Weeks, although the company may hire a
chief administrative officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tate and Weeks were hired to replace Dennis Chantland, a
respected operations whiz who left the company last summer, causing
the company's stock to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable has been set for Friedman to assume the CEO's post,
Lester said yesterday.
</P>

launch a shelter magazine tied to the Pottery Barn concept,
Friedman said.

BOFA EXEC THRIVES DESPITE TAKEOVER TURMOIL   &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The takeover of Bank of America by NationsBank 18 months ago has
produced its share of surprises. Few seem more unlikely than the
success of Michael Murray.
<P>
   Just a year ago, BofA watchers predicted that Murray, president
of the combined bank's global, corporate and investment banking
operations, was a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only top-ranking executive left from San Francisco's
old BofA. All his former colleagues, including old BofA's Chief
Executive Officer David Coulter, had been forced out or jumped
ship. His operations suffered huge losses when Asian financial
markets crashed in 1998, and some observers pointed fingers at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people write him off,'' said Michael O'Neill, a
longtime friend and chief financial officer of the old BofA, who
quit the combined bank early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom held that Murray would stick around only
long enough for NationsBank executives to get a handle on the
businesses he ran. His replacement had even been identified _ Ed
Brown, the NationsBank corporate banking chief, who was dispatched
to San Francisco as Murray's second in command.
</P>
<P>
   By about now, BofA watchers figured, Murray would be gone. Once
he was out of the way, the &UR;  &LR; headquarters of corporate and global
banking would jump from San Francisco to the bank's home office in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for conventional wisdom. Murray isn't only
surviving _ he's thriving. His businesses are earning big money,
he's developed a close working relationship with Brown and his
position seems solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good rapport between him and other senior
managers,'' said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Catherine Murray,
no relation to the BofA executive.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Michael Murray say they are not surprised by his
survival. They say it reflects adaptability, top-notch management
skills and an unflappable, no-nonsense approach to the job. It
probably also helps that he runs a sprawling network of businesses
that NationsBank executives don't fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a bulldog,'' said O'Neill. ``I've never seen him
lose a bureaucratic battle.``
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Murray said the acrimony that
marked the early days of the BofA takeover haven't scarred his
relations with his NationsBank colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along fine. We've all got a shared goal,'' said Murray,
55, a compact and hearty man with an oval face, eyeglasses and a
full head of salt-and-pepper hair.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's Global, Corporate and Investment Bank is one the
world's largest wholesale banking operations, producing about $8.9
billion in revenue last year. It does business in 38 countries,
vies with Chase Manhattan for the title of largest U.S. corporate
lender and owns the former Montgomery Securities, renamed Banc of
America Securities, a major investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of running such a vast operation is what keeps
Murray on board, he said. ``Why would you get up from the table as
the game becomes more interesting?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the corporate bank will stay in San Francisco for the
foreseeable future. ``This is the headquarters,`` Murray said. ``We
will expand here.``
</P>
<P>
   The presence of BofA's corporate bank is a big deal locally.
Some 2,190 people work for it in &UR;  &LR; the Bay Area, about 175 fewer
than in late 1998. Add in support staff at the bank's Concord
computer center and the current figure rises to about 4,390
employees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Some departments, such as syndicated lending, have closed
shop here. But such job losses have been partly offset by a hiring
binge at BofA Securities. ``We've put a lot of people into the
(Transamerica) Pyramid,'' the investment bank's headquarters,
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   If Murray has kept an even keel over the past 18 months, it's
probably because he's sailed these seas before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the old BofA bought Chicago's Continental Bank, the
institution where Murray built his career. Murray said he expected
to be shown the door once BofA took command.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Coulter became CEO in 1996, he found the bank's
executive suites rife with bureaucratic infighting. So he tapped
two former Continental executives, O'Neill and Murray, as his top
deputies. O'Neill became chief financial officer, while Murray got
the corporate banking job Coulter himself previously held.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, as Coulter was finalizing what he hoped would be a
``merger of equals'' with NationsBank, Murray was one of many
advisers who warned that NationsBank CEO Hugh McColl would &UR;  &LR; eat
Coulter alive, according to people familiar with the situation.
Coulter paid no attention.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank completed its purchase of BofA as markets in Asia
and other developing regions were crashing. The old BofA was losing
hundreds of millions of dollars trading securities in Asia, Russia
and elsewhere, operations Murray supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Murray got through that period by keeping his head down and
concentrating on the job at hand _ combining the corporate and
international operations of two of the nation's largest financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He won the trust of the NationsBank brass by showing a pragmatic
willingness to accept the new order. But he was no sycophant. At a
meeting of top executives in Dallas shortly after the takeover,
Murray quietly told McColl he had been wrong to humiliate Coulter
and force him out, according to several people familiar with the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a year later, ``everybody has reached a modus
vivendi,'' said Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at the New Jersey
brokerage Ryan Beck. ``Mike is well trusted by NationsBank
management and he's learned to live with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's standing stems from his ability to produce strong
profits even as he is overseeing a monumental merger.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Murray's Global, Corporate and Investment Bank earned
$2.6 billion of the bank's total $8.2 billion in profits. That
represented a solid 18 percent return on equity, or &UR;  &LR; 18 cents of
profit for every dollar of capital allocated to the business,
slightly better than the bank as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's division did even better in the first quarter of this
year, earning $960 million and posting a return on equity of 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Strong corporate banking profits largely reflect a booming U.S.
economy, recovery in Asia and a sharp rise in stock price, results
that will be hard to duplicate now that markets have turned more
treacherous. ``The market has frankly been rather kind to us,''
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray produced strong earnings even as he was completely
rebuilding the investment banking operations of Banc of America
Securities. Most of the unit's investment bankers quit after former
Montgomery chief Thomas Weisel left to form his own firm in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York investment banking chief Carter McClelland, BofA
Securities is back in the business of selling merger advice and
managing stock offerings. But the unit remains in the industry's
second tier, far behind leaders such as Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a bow to NationsBank's low tolerance for risk,
Murray has sharply cut back on speculative investments in
developing markets, such as Russia. While the bank remains
committed to the Asian, Latin American and European markets, the
bank sees its most attractive opportunities in expanding business
with traditional U.S. corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   So, will Murray really stick around to see through the
combination of two big banks? ``You come here a year from now and
we'll have another conversation,'' he said, grinning mischievously.
The implication was obvious _ Mike Murray isn't going anywhere.

SAD ENDING FOR A STOCK MYSTERY 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: &LR;  I have two old stock certificates, and am trying to &LR; 
 &LR; trace the companies. One is Great American Bank, the other is &LR; 
 &LR; NVF Corp. I would appreciate any information you can offer &LR;   &LR; about
these companies. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR; A: I'm afraid I can offer you only bad news and worse news.
</P>
<P>
   Great American Bank, a savings and loan based in San Diego, was
seized by federal thrift regulators in 1991 after its finances were
ruined by unwise investments and alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders didn't get anything at that time, but a year or
so later, many of them did recover a pittance _ about 25 cents per
share, after payment of legal fees _ in a class-action lawsuit
brought against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The class action was spearheaded by the law firm of Milberg
Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, of San Diego. You might want to ask
them whether you are one of the shareholders eligible for
settlement money, and if so, how to get it. Their phone number is
(619) 231-1058, cq &LR; and their address is 600 W. Broadway, San Diego,
CA 92101.
</P>
<P>
   Take care not to spend all your settlement money on telephone
tolls and postage.
</P>
<P>
   As for NVF, a maker of fiber insulation, the company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1993. It was reorganized in
1996, and the creditors got 47 cents on the dollar, but the
shareholders got zip.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Basis of Inherited Shares
</P>
<P>
   &LR; q  &LR; Q: A relative of mine passed away on January 29, and I
inherited some stock. I understand that I need to know the prices
of the stock on that date, because that becomes my cost basis in
calculating capital gains or losses whenever I sell any shares. How
do I find out the prices for that date?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: January 29 was a Saturday, so your stocks weren't traded
that day. That means you will want to determine the prices for the
surrounding trade dates: January 28, Friday, and January 31,
Monday. You then must apply an intricate formula prescribed by tax
law to determine your cost basis. (I'll give you the details
below.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Internet, you can get the prices of
your stocks for that date from the Yahoo Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Go to  &LR; www.yahoo.com &LR; . Click on the link for ``Stock Quotes.''
Enter the symbol for the stock in question and click ``Get
Quotes.'' Then click on the ``Chart'' link, and when the next page
comes up, click the link to the ``daily'' table. You then can enter
the date or dates of any prices you are looking up.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have access to the Internet, then one simple
alternative is to go to the nearest public library branch and
examine The Chronicle, the Wall Street Journal or any other
newspaper that provides full, daily stock listings.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, you would look up the high and low prices for
January 28 and January 31. Add the high and low prices for each day
and divide by two. Now, take the result for January 31 and add it
to twice the result for January 28. Then divide that answer by
three.
</P>
<P>
   Voila! That is your cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   The main point of that absurdly complicated exercise is to give
greater weight to the trading session nearest the deceased's date
of death. The date one day away from the death gets twice the
weighting of the date two days away.
</P>
<P>
   When someone is considerate enough to die on a trading day, the
calculation becomes simpler. You would take the high and low prices
for that day, add them and divide by two.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Companies, Credit Cards
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hold a corporate credit card, issued by American Express,
that I use for business travel. There is currently a past-due
amount and my company seems in no hurry to pay it. If my company
remains delinquent, will this reflect badly on my personal credit
rating?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Mie-Yun Lee, editorial director of BuyerZone.com, says
that as a general rule, if a credit card is issued to you
indirectly, through your employer, your credit rating will not be
jeopardized if the employer neglects to pay the balance due. If the
card was issued directly to you, on the other hand, then your
credit could be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not quite that cut and dried in the case of
American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Don Monroe says the responsibility for
delinquent payments can vary from employer to employer. He suggests
that you discuss the matter with your employer's credit-card
program administrator. He says you also should call the toll-free
information number indicated on the back of the American Express
card.

OFT-DELAYED MAC OS IS DELAYED AGAIN 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Apple's next-generation operating system, scheduled for ``next
year'' since the mid-1990s, has been delayed again, at least for
users waiting for a final, fully tested version.
<P>
   Five months ago, the company said the new software, known as Mac
OS X, would go on sale this summer. But Monday, Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs, in an uncharacteristically low-key presentation
opening Apple's annual developers' conference in San Jose, said Mac
OS X 1.0 won't be released until January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient Mac users, however, will still be able to get a taste
of the long-awaited upgrade soon: The revised timetable announced
yesterday adds plans to make a ``beta'' test version available to
the public this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Apple still intends to begin preinstalling Mac OS X on new Macs
early next year, just as previously planned, according to
spokeswoman Nathalie Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS X (pronounced OS 10) promises more stability and higher
performance than the current Mac OS 9, thanks especially to new
technical underpinnings borrowed from the Unix operating system. In
addition, Apple is adding powerful graphics capabilities, plus a
user interface it calls Aqua.
</P>
<P>
   The Aqua interface Apple unveiled last January won only mixed
reviews: Its elegant design, bright colors and slick animated
routines evoked oohs and aahs, but some users and developers
complained that it went too far in modifying the long-established
Mac look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   The new version Jobs showed yesterday appeared to be a response
to that feedback, preserving Aqua's appearance but giving users the
option of making it behave more like the current Mac desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really shooting to give people a level of fit and finish
never seen before in a desktop OS,'' Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will run on all Macs with at least 64 megabytes
of memory and a factory-installed PowerPC G3 or G4 processor,
according to Apple. Virtually all current Mac applications should
be compatible with it, although they'll have to be modified to take
advantage of the system's enhanced features.
</P>
<P>
   To help programmers with that task, Apple delivered a new
``Developer Preview'' version of Mac OS X _ the fourth so far _ to
the 3,579 attendees of this week's conference. Reflecting the
company's recent success, attendance is up sharply _ in 1998 only
1,801 developers showed up, and last year there were 2,563.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 companies have already promised products that take
advantage of Mac OS X, according to Apple. One of the latest is
Alias-Wavefront, which yesterday announced plans to bring Maya, its
high-end 3-D modeling and animation package, to the Mac for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also showed a new version of QuickTime, Apple's multimedia
software for both Mac and Windows. Due this summer, the new version
will let users encode and play back video in the MPEG-1 and MPEG-2
formats, which offer  &LR; provide higher quality than formats in
general use for downloadable clips today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jobs said Apple has slashed the price for an
unlimited, one-server license to WebObjects, its tool kit for
creating Web-based applications, from $50,000 to $699. Users of the
program, which runs on several operating systems, include AT&AMP;T,
Disney, Mercedes and Sony.

   Variable Annuities Are Not for Everyone &HT;       By Arthur M. Louis
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; More than 20 million people have assets totaling $1 trillion
tied up in variable annuities. New money has been flowing into
these hybrid investments _ life insurance crossed with mutual funds
_ at a rate of more than $140 billion per year.
<P>
   Judging from their extraordinary popularity, one might assume
that variable annuities must be a great choice for just about
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   But financial experts suggest that many people who buy variable
annuities would be better off investing in mutual funds alone.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are considerably more pricey than straight
fund investments, the experts point out.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual fee paid by variable-annuity account holders
is about 2.13 percent, compared with about 1.48 percent for
straight mutual-fund investments. Variable-annuity buyers pay extra
for the product's insurance component, which may or may not prove
to be an actual benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors in variable annuities can be hit with
punitive ``surrender fees'' if they close their accounts within
seven years after opening them. The fees range up to 7 percent of
the annuity assets.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback is that variable annuities receive less
favorable tax treatment than mutual funds when you withdraw your
money or pass it along to your heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are so complicated _ and subject to so many
mind-numbing rules _ that many consumers can't properly appraise
them.
</P>
<P>
   Often consumers simply succumb to pressure from
insurance-company salespeople, who emphasize the more enticing
features while soft-pedaling the drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are popular with salespeople because they
generate large commissions. The commission on a variable-annuity
sale is generally equal to between 5 percent and 8 percent of the
assets the buyer invests.
</P>
<P>
   Lately there have been signs that the variable-annuity market is
becoming more friendly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Intense competition has caused some insurers to reduce their
fees and even eliminate surrender fees. And some are offering
expanded product lines that transcend the old rules and allow
buyers more freedom to tailor an annuity to their specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you think a variable annuity might suit you, it pays to shop
around.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are designed primarily as retirement
vehicles: Any benefits they offer go almost entirely to the annuity
holder. They are not a good choice if your principal concern is to
pass money to heirs.
</P>
<P>
   They are offered by most leading insurers, such as Prudential,
Travelers and Equitable, and by the insurance arms of mutual-fund
groups (such as Vanguard and Fidelity) and brokerage firms (among
them, Schwab and Waterhouse).
</P>
<P>
   They allow you to sock away unlimited amounts of money in a
tax-deferred account, with the money invested in your choice of
mutual funds offered by the insurer. When you are ready to retire,
you can withdraw money from the account, usually in a stream of
monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   As with individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans, your
investment gains accumulate untaxed as long as you leave your money
in the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   At retirement, you can choose one of three basic ways to
withdraw money from the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   _You can take it in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   _You can take it in periodic payments _ usually monthly _
continuing for a fixed, limited number of years, with the option
that unpaid installments will go to your heirs if you die during
the payout period.
</P>
<P>
   _You can elect fixed payments continuing to the end of your
life. Their size will depend on your life expectancy and how well
your annuity investments have performed.
</P>
<P>
   With most variable annuities, if you begin receiving lifetime
payments, the insurance company keeps any money remaining in your
account when you die. That could amount to a substantial sum if you
die early.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gamble much like straight life insurance, but in
reverse. With straight life insurance, the consumer makes out
better _ financially, that is _ by dying early rather than late.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest argument for variable annuities, experts agree, is
that they allow you to put aside an unlimited amount of money,
tax-deferred.
</P>
<P>
   With IRAs, you are restricted to legal maximum contributions
totaling $2,000 annually. With 401(k)s, the limit maximum  &LR; is 15
percent of your salary to a maximum of $10,500, whichever is
smaller. (The dollar limit is indexed to rise with inflation.)
</P>
<P>
   If, after maxing out your IRA or 401(k) in any given year, you
still have a chunk of cash that you won't need for a long time and
that you are willing to invest in the market, a variable annuity
may be a viable choice. Bear in mind, however, that your investment
gains in a variable annuity will be taxed at ordinary income rates
when you take your money out. You won't be entitled to the lower
tax rates that apply to long-term capital gains you earn from
direct investments in stocks or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The tax man also takes a big bite if you pass your annuity along
to your heirs. People who inherit annuities are required to pay
taxes _ again, at ordinary income rates _ on any investment gains.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if someone inherits stock or mutual funds, the cost
basis is stepped up to the value of the stock on the day the owner
died. The heir doesn't have to pay tax on any gains that accrued
before the owner's death.
</P>
<P>
   The extra annual fee charged for variable annuities enables the
issuer to guarantee lifetime payments and to promise a rock-bottom
reimbursement to the account holder's heirs, notes Tom Conner, vice
president and general counsel of the National Association of
Variable Annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the heirs will receive no less than the amount that
the annuity buyer contributed to the account, even if the
investments have been eaten away by a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   However, financial experts say this rock-bottom guarantee seldom
is worth much from a practical standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock market tends to move up over the long term,
chances are your annuity will be worth more than you invested by
the time you die.
</P>
<P>
   The rock-bottom feature could make a variable annuity an
attractive choice in the sad, special case where the buyer is
terminally ill, notes Tom Tracy, a financial planner with the
Kochis Fitz firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy explains that variable annuities allow such a person to
take big gambles in the stock market with complete safety.
</P>
<P>
   The annuity holder can choose the riskiest mutual funds. If
their value shoots up, well and good: The heirs will reap the gains
when the annuity holder dies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the investments collapse, the heirs are
entitled to the money-back guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an actual client situation like this,'' Tracy remarks.
</P>
<P>
   While the average 0.65 percent difference in annual fees between
variable annuities and straight mutual-fund investments may not
seem like much, it can amount to a lot over the course of decades.
</P>
<P>
   To take a simple example, suppose one investor puts $50,000 into
a mutual fund charging annual fees totaling 1.25 percent, while
another buys a variable annuity charging annual fees of 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If both investments grow at a steady 10 percent annually, the
annuity will be worth $30,000 less than the straight fund
investment after 20 years because of the higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   This comparison glosses over the fact that the gains in the
variable annuity will be tax-deferred for the 20 years, while an
un-deferred fund investment will be subject along the way to taxes
on dividends and capital-gains distributions.
</P>
<P>
   However, someone who invests directly in mutual funds can
minimize the tax impact by choosing index funds. Index funds _
consisting of stocks that emulate a particular stock-market index,
such as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 _ are passively managed, and
capital-gains distributions are relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds also tend to have exceptionally low management fees
_ usually less than 0.2 percent of assets annually.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco financial planner Norm Boone says that investors
who take the trouble to do the math _ admittedly, a difficult
proposition, because few people know for sure how long they will
live _ may find that a buy-and-hold, unsheltered investment in a
mutual fund will do better, bottom line, than a tax-deferred
annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Annuity investors also must take into account the &UR;  &LR; large
surrender fees.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, if you don't stick with your annuity for more
than seven years _ if you need to close the account sooner to meet
unforeseen expenses, such as a medical emergency _ the insurer will
confiscate a substantial portion of your investment.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, you will lose 7 percent of your annuity assets if you
close your account during the first year; 6 percent during the
second year, and so on down the scale until the fee phases out
after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Danville retirement planner Richard DelMonte points out that
most buyers of variable annuities also get locked in at the other
end of the line when they start receiving periodic payments.
</P>
<P>
   Under most annuity contracts, once the account holders begin to
get their payments, they cannot withdraw the rest of their money no
matter what. They must stick with the predetermined payment
schedule, whatever crises they face.
</P>
<P>
   However, this rule is beginning to bend, thanks to the pressure
of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Conner notes that some insurers have begun selling annuities
that allow account holders to withdraw all their funds even after
the periodic payments have begun.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules are bending as well: Some insurers now guarantee
that annuity payments will not fall below a certain minimum level
no matter how the investments perform.
</P>
<P>
   And some insurers are throwing in bonus features that might
appeal to prospective retirees, such as long-term care insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been some significant price breakthroughs. By
and large, annual management fees have been coming down, and some
issuers are either reducing or eliminating surrender fees.
</P>
<P>
   TIAA-CREF, based in New York, now charges fees ranging from a
stunningly low 0.37 percent of assets per year to 0.59 percent,
depending on which mutual funds the account holder selects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it does not charge surrender fees.
</P>
<P>
   TIAA-CREF is a not-for-profit organization _ the world's largest
retirement system _ primarily serving educators. It can charge
bargain rates because it doesn't have a paid sales force, says
Dennis Foley, vice president for annuities and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the TIAA-CREF annuities are not available to the
general public. But they soon will be, Foley notes.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is seeking approval for this change from all
the state insurance departments.
</P>
<P>
   Other issuers with particularly low variable-annuity fees
include the Vanguard and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the
Waterhouse brokerage firm.

LYCOS, SPANISH TELECOM FIRM MAY MERGE  &HT;     BY VERNE KOPYTOFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Terra Networks, the Internet arm of Spanish telecommunications firm
Telefonica, is negotiating to buy Lycos, the giant Web portal, in a
deal that could be worth nearly $10 billion.
<P>
   If the merger is approved, the combined companies would create
an international Internet powerhouse that would rank among the top
five Web properties in terms of users.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Fuentes, a spokesman for Terra Networks, would not talk
about the negotiations other than to say that they are in progress.
Lycos refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos has seen America Online and Yahoo shoot right past
them,'' said Emily Meehan, an Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a technology research firm in Boston. ``Wall Street is
looking for Lycos to differentiate itself from its competitors.
This seems like a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   By buying Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., Terra Networks would
be able to expand beyond its roots in offering Internet access,
Meehan said. The company could immediately take advantage of Lycos'
strength in online retailing and advertising revenue, she said.
Last quarter, Lycos had revenue of $44.3 million from advertising
and $24.2 million from e-commerce licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan added that the deal gives Terra Networks, which has 2
million mostly Spanish and Portuguese language-speaking
subscribers, greater reach into Latin America, Europe and the
English-speaking world. Lycos has a strong international presence
with, for example, a third-place ranking in Germany, according to
Media Metrix, an online ratings service.
</P>
<P>
   uncx In March, Lycos was the forth-most-visited U.S. Web site
behind America Online, Yahoo and Microsoft. However, Meehan said
Terra Networks should not expect Lycos to gain much ground in the
United States because the Internet portal field here is already too
crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Quinn, an analyst with the Yankee Group, said the deal
also positions Terra Networks to offer Lycos as the Internet portal
on wireless telephones. That market, she said, is particularly
profitable and has a big potential for growth, especially in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Terra Networks and Lycos follow a
series of big acquisitions in the Internet industry as companies
try to increase their reach and offerings. In January, America
Online announced its intention to buy Time Warner, the media giant,
while Disney bought Infoseek, an Internet portal, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, USA Networks, the cable television company headed by
Barry Diller, considered acquiring Lycos. But Lycos shareholders
ultimately rejected the idea because they thought that the $22
billion offered was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock has surged by nearly a third over the past few days
in response to the possible merger. Monday, the stock increased
about 14 percent, from $54.13 to $61.56.

BOFA TOPS ITS STATE GOAL FOR COMMUNITY SPENDING 
 &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bank of America said Monday that its 1999 California community
development spending handily beat the target it set when the North
Carolina bank bought San Francisco's BofA and took its name 18
months ago.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The bank's $12.3 billion of community lending and investment
in the state last year far exceeded the $7 billion minimum bank
officials had promised to spend annually before the takeover. About
$6.6 billion was spent in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's 1999 results in the state _ the first full year following
NationsBank's purchase of the old BofA _ represented about 31
percent of its nationwide total of $39.6 billion in community
development financing.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, bank officials said, community development spending in
the state rose between 10 and 15 percent last year compared with
1998. The bank is using 1999 as its benchmark year and said
premerger comparisons are not accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Loans for affordable housing represented about three-quarters of
the bank's community development spending in the state last year.
BofA's $9.1 billion in affordable housing credits in California
represented a 7.4 percent rise from 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   But small business loans dropped slightly in 1999 to $2.28
billion. Bank officials said they are taking steps to increase
small business lending.
</P>
<P>
   Activist groups said they were impressed overall. The disclosure
appeared to ease fears that the bank would shortchange communities
in a state across the continent from its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of two of the most influential community
coalitions, Greenlining Institute and California Reinvestment
Committee, said they were troubled by several apparent
shortcomings, such as a decline in small business credits and low
lending levels in some black and Latino neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early in the process to congratulate them, but we're
not willing to criticize them,'' said Greenlining policy director
Robert Gnaizda.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did not publicly break out loans by race or ethnic
group. But activists who have met with bank officials said data on
the bank's loans to Latinos and blacks were disappointing. ``The
numbers were very low,'' said Greenlining member George Bivins, a
black businessman from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups say they also worry that BofA headquarters may
be imposing its community development priorities, making it tougher
to tailor programs just for California. ``They have to say,
`Mother, may I' now,'' said Gelly Borromeo, president of the
National Council of Asian-American Business Associations.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, BofA officials emphasized the sheer size of the
bank's investment in California low-income communities. ``We
honored our commitments at a faster clip than the market was
expecting,'' said Connie Beck, the bank's regional president for
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   When NationsBank's purchase of BofA was pending in 1998, the
bank pledged $350 billion for low-income and minority communities
over 10 years, the largest such commitment ever made by a bank. No
amount was formally earmarked for California, but bank officials
said they considered the old BofA's 10-year $70 billion program a
minimum they hoped to beat.

WIT, E-TRADE TEAM UP IN E-OFFERING DEAL  &HT;     BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Wit Capital Group, one of the more prominent investment banks
specializing in online stock offerings, said Monday that it will
buy E-Offering, a smaller online investment bank founded by Menlo
Park's E-Trade Group, in a stock deal worth $370 million.
<P>
   As part of the deal, E-Trade _ the second-largest online broker
after Charles Schwab _ will acquire the accounts of Wit's 100,000
brokerage customers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither E-Offering nor the Wit brokerage operation have proved
particularly successful. The two firms figure that Wit's
investment-banking expertise will breathe life into E-Offering and
that E-Trade's brokerage expertise will optimize Wit's brokerage
base.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Wit nor E-Trade would say so, observers suggest
that the transaction _ which the firms described as a ``strategic
alliance'' _ could lead &UR;  &LR; to an eventual merger between the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that there is a great likelihood they will
merge,'' said Scott Appleby, an analyst with Robertson Stephens in
San Francisco. ``It may take two years. They will have kind of a
courting period during which the synergies between the firms will
become evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Wit, based in New York, and E-Trade certainly will be on
exceptionally cozy terms after the deal closes, sometime during the
third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of E-Offering _ the largest being E-Trade, General
Atlantic Partners and Softbank _ will receive 32 million shares of
Wit stock, or roughly 25 percent of the total outstanding. In
addition, E-Trade will buy 2 million additional shares more &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Wit stock closed at $11.56 on Nasdaq Monday, up $1.31.
</P>
<P>
   Wit _ through its Wit SoundView subsidiary _ will become the
exclusive provider of initial public offerings, secondary offerings
and other investment banking products to E-Trade's 2.6 million
customers. E-Trade customers also will gain access to Wit's
proprietary research.
</P>
<P>
   Christos M. Cotsakos, chairman and chief executive of E-Trade,
will join Wit's board of directors, as will Bill Ford of General
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this strategic alliance, we are creating an
Internet-driven category killer that offers investors an expanded
world of financial opportunities,'' Cotsakos said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald W. Readmond, co-chief executive of Wit SoundView,
predicted a big improvement in E-Offering's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-Offering is where we were a year and a half ago,'' he said.
``We have the experience and know the positives and negatives. The
negatives are minimal, the positives are spectacular. This deal
gives us a West Coast presence, really good people and E-Trade's
technology perspective.''

AP USES FILES IN DEBATE ON MASSACRE IN KOREA WAR  

</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press released detailed evidence Monday to rebut
critics of its Pulitzer Prize-winning news report that said
American soldiers, acting under orders, killed hundreds of South
Korean civilians in July 1950, in the early days of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence released Monday was a document that cast
doubt on part of a critical article by U.S. News &AMP; World Report
that said records showed that one witness had been evacuated a full
day before the shootings began. An editor for the magazine said the
document was not included in its report through ``an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the AP released full-length quotations from two
former servicemen who said in the pages of U.S. News that the AP
had misquoted them. In both cases, the full quotations tended to
refute that claim.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling documents and interviews are part of a controversy
that is being closely watched by journalists, military observers
and diplomats, because the outcome of the debate over the report
could affect United States-South Korean relations. If a
Pentagon-authorized commission that is investigating the case
determines that the soldiers had been given orders to fire, that
could mean that a war crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials told The New York Times last week
that they had confirmed the central element of the report, that
United States troops had fired on unarmed civilians, killing
hundreds. But on the crucial question of whether the troops were
acting under orders, the evidence provided in the dueling
journalistic accounts is both ambiguous and contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline ``Doubts about a Korean `Massacre,''' a U.S.
News reporter, Joseph L. Galloway, wrote, ``There is little doubt
that something terrible happened there.'' But the article offered
evidence from military documents that indicated that three
witnesses quoted by the AP _ Edward Daily, Delos Flint and Eugene
Hesselman _ were not at the scene at No Gun Ri at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The AP rebuttal reported that the magazine, in its suggestion
about Flint, relied on a ``war diary'' written days later at the
regimental level and ignored a ``morning report'' filed daily from
the front. The morning report, indicating the location and status
of GIs, indicates that Flint was wounded on July 26, the day of the
reported shooting, and could have been there to witness it.
</P>
<P>
   The executive editor of the magazine, Brian Duffy, said Monday
night, ``We should have cited the morning report that said he was
wounded on the 26th, and on our part it was an oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran who served in one of the units said to be
involved in the killings, gave conflicting accounts to the
reporters for the AP and Galloway. On Monday, the AP released the
full text of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The text indicates that when the veteran, Herman Patterson,
said, ``It was just wholesale slaughter,'' he was speaking of the
events at No Gun Ri, not another battle. Patterson told U.S. News
that those remarks were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   A second witness who is being challenged, Edward Daily, told the
AP and other news organizations, including NBC News, The Washington
Post, The New York Times and U.S. News, that he was a machine
gunner at No Gun Ri and that he fired, under orders, into the
refugees huddled under the stone bridge there.
</P>
<P>
   But Daily's service records, obtained by U.S. News, ``show that
Daily was not at No Gun Ri on July 26, 1950; nor was he a machine
gunner,'' the magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   The wire service account acknowledges the discrepancy in the
records. Both the wire service and U.S. News have reported that the
original personnel records were lost in a fire in 1973 at the Army
personnel records center in St. Louis. The current personnel
records have been reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported Monday that other veterans said they had seen
Daily at No Gun Ri. The wire service also said Daily had showed
them a variety of documents attesting to his service in Company H,
one of the units involved, in the months before the attack. Those
papers included a driver's license and a menu from a dinner held by
Company H at Christmas in 1949 that lists him with the company.

<P>
   SANTA CLARA PUEBLO, N.M. _ The battle to contain the wildfire
here has broken down into several diverging fronts, with modest
signs of hope in the city of Los Alamos, where most residents were
allowed to return Monday, but also growing anger over the threat to
ancient Indian dwellings and lands that tribal officials say had
initially not been well protected.
</P>
<P>
   A visit Monday to the Santa Clara canyon, at the northern
perimeter of the fire, brought encounters with swirls of thick
white smoke, brush fires just yards from the road, occasionally
exploding pine trees and nervous teams of firefighters known as
hotshots. Some of them conceded that they were able to do little
more than hope that blazes along the southern edge of the canyon
would not be blasted by the winds toward the invaluable
archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Los Alamos, at the southern edge of the wildfire,
and at the nuclear weapons laboratory nearby, officials said the
fire was largely contained and that about two-thirds of the 11,000
evacuated residents were permitted to return Monday afternoon,
earlier than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   But officials continue to take stock of the staggering losses,
which include 405 housing units and, at the lab site, five
dilapidated but historic structures where parts of the original
atomic bomb were assembled for the Manhattan Project during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the old wooden structures remained, the building
where the conventional explosives portion of the first bomb, known
as Trinity, was put together. The actual building where the Trinity
bomb was assembled, a simple wooden structure, was taken down years
ago, said Turnel Martinez, a lab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said in Los Alamos that while the fire had
consumed at least 44,323 acres the pace of desctruction had slowed.
More important, they said, the fire was 28 percent contained,
mostly along the southern and southeastern edges, near the town of
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,268 firefighters are now battling the blaze in the
wooded areas, and 250 or so protecting homes and other structures
in populated areas, a level that Jim Paxon, the Forest Service
spokesman, said would likely be the peak.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set 11 days ago by the National Park Service as a
prescribed burn in an effort to thin dense ponderosa pine forests,
before high winds helped create a blaze out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news was generally good on the level of containment
in the south, winds are expected to pick up, and a cold front is
predicted for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have continued fear possible leaks of radiation
from the grounds of the lab, either from structures that might have
been damaged by fire, or from old dump sites where, years ago, the
lab put low-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the lab said no buildings containing radioactive
materials had been damaged and that their sensors had detected no
radiation leaks. In addition, Gregg Dempsey, the director of a unit
at the Environmental Protection Agency that monitors radiation,
said the government had placed 20 more monitors around the Los
Alamos region.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we're not seeing any cause for concern for
radiological release,'' said Jim Straka, a Department of Energy
official involved in the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   But to the north, Indian officials expressed concern over what
they said was a slow initial response to the fire in their area,
and the heavy blow they could suffer if the fire jumped across the
Santa Clara canyon, on the pueblo, or reservation, northeast of Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara Pueblo covers almost 50,000 acres and has about
1,500 residents. It is also home to spectacular ancient dwellings
that are believed to have been built about 800 years ago into the
buff-hued sandstone of the Puye cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose that canyon and the creek, we lose quite a bit of
our resources,'' said Denny Gutierrez, the governor of the Santa
Clara Pueblo tribal authority.
</P>
<P>
   He said a major source of revenue for the tribe were the fees
for permits to hunt, fish and camp in the canyon and for visits to
the Puye cliffs. A big concern is that the fire could dump huge
amounts of ash into the Santa Clara creek, in the bottom of the
canyon, choking it off and making it unusable for irrigation or
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, that would probably devastate the pueblo,'' said
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   He said firefighters were doing an excellent job, but that when
the fire first burst out of control, firefighters were slow in
responding to suggestions that they build fire lines to the north,
not just in the south near Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sounded to us like this was not a priority,'' said
Charles Sisneros, a tribal council member. ``That's not the way we
see it. This is our home and we have an obligation to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Baca, another member of the tribal council, stood in the
bottom of the canyon Monday watching the blaze send up huge plumes
of white smoke and brush fires burn to the road, and said he was
also angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indecision was the problem,'' he said. ``We asked them to
cut the fire lines on the Forest Service land and they just said
they hadn't gotten the permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon of the forest service said the firefighters had done
everything they could. ``Our object is to minimize the impact on
the Santa Clara Pueblo,'' said Paxon. ``We do take their needs to
heart. We feel we have adequate resources there. We didn't delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the pueblo lands were now among the most
vulnerable, particularly if the wind does whip up as expected.
Jerry Soard, a member of a hotshot crew from Carson City, Nev.,
watched as the fire spread its dark fingers down the canyon and
tightened its grip over the heavily wooded Indian land. He
expressed some optimism because the fire was moving slowly and
burning highly combustible brush that could feed an even fiercer
fire if the winds picked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing pretty much what we want it to do at this point,''
said Soard. ``This is beneficial. It's a real nice backing fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this meant the fire might be brought under control
here, another hotshot team member, Chris White, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control? You can't say that,'' said White. ``Not with these
winds. The problem is that when they get into the canyon they get
so squirrelly. They blow every direction.''

<P>
   Dong Kingman, an American-born watercolorist known for
humorously illustrational cityscapes, magazine covers and
contributions to Hollywood films, died on Friday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman was born in Oakland, Calif., in 1911. His father was a
Chinese immigrant who worked as a laundryman and dry goods
merchant. The family returned to Hong Kong when the artist was a
child. There he studied traditional painting and calligraphy, as
well as European styles, and worked briefly in an architectural
drafting office and with a motion picture company. His early
ambition was to direct films.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States during the Depression and
supported his painting by working in his brother's factory and as a
houseboy for a San Francisco family. After a successful first show
of watercolors in 1933 he joined the Works Progress Administration
for five years, while also teaching at the Academy of Advertising
Art in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought one of Kingman's
paintings, and later two more. His New York solo debut was at
Midtown Gallery in 1942. In the same year he was awarded the first
of two Guggenheim Fellowships. After serving in the Army during
World War II, he moved to New York, where he taught at Columbia
University and Hunter College, and at the Famous Artists School in
Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman also showed with Wildenstein and Hammer galleries in New
York, but magazines and films expanded his audience. He did many
illustrations, including covers for Time, Life and Saturday Review.
</P>
<P>
   His urban scenes have a cheery, gently humorous flavor, best
sampled in a 40-foot rice-paper scroll that he created in 1954
while on a cultural exchange program sponsored by the State
Department. The scroll was published in Life.
</P>
<P>
   He also painted mood-setting scenes for films like ``Flower Drum
Song'' (1961) and ``55 Days at Peking'' (1963), and was technical
and promotional adviser for ``The World of Suzie Wong'' (1960). The
paintings appeared in the films or were records of production. A
1997 book on Kingman is peppered with photographs of the artist
posing beside Hollywood celebrities. This summer the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is organizing an exhibition of his
film-related work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of
China arranged a show of his paintings in Beijing. The Taipei Fine
Arts Museum in Taiwan organized ``40 Years of Watercolors by Dong
Kingman'' in 1994; in 1999 a retrospective was organized by the
Taichung Provincial Museum in Taiwan. Another retrospective is
scheduled to tour in the United States in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings by Kingman are owned by the Metropolitan Museum, the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Whitney Museum of American
Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts,
Boston, and are in private collections.
</P>
<P>
   Kingman's first wife, Janice Wong, died in 1954. His second
wife, Helena Kuo, died in 1999. He is survived by two sons, Dong
Jr. of Manhattan and Eddie of Garden Grove, Calif.; four sisters,
Sylvia Wong of Hong Kong, Esther Fong and Lily Tang of Sacramento,
and Oi-Ying Ho of Malaysia; and four grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: AT INDIANA, THE TOADIES ARE SHOCKED  

</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story comes down to 2.3 seconds of hard-core evidence that
could not be swept away with contemptuous denial, the kind that Bob
Knight's toadies in Bloomington, Ind., directed at the young man
whose neck fit so snugly into Knight's steel grip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even when the sickening video flashed across the
country's television and computer screens, the toadies practically
celebrated the almost irrelevant discrepancies in Neil Reed's
account of the incident. The truth they'd been living with for so
long was apparently too painful to see.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 29 years of being held hostage by a basketball
coach, Indiana University has been compelled by a videotape to
investigate Knight, and Monday the school announced the results in
the way medical experts unveil the cracking of genetic codes.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Bob Knight had engaged in a ``lengthy pattern
of troubling behavior?''
</P>
<P>
   Myles Brand, the university president, and John Walda, the
president of its board of trustees, sat through a news conference
with straight and solemn faces and claimed this was news to them.
They implied they had no idea that a man who'd habitually become
unglued in public was capable of much worse behind closed offices
and gymnasium doors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they had some idea, but never all the sordid, embarrassing
details, and even with the investigation complete and thoroughly
impartial, ``the pattern'' was the main problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``No incident by itself rose to the level of termination,''
Brand said, after declaring that Knight had accepted a three-game
suspension, a $30,000 fine and a zero-tolerance policy in exchange
for ``one last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The choking of a student-athlete was not enough for them to
dismiss this ``man of integrity,'' as described by Brand. Nor the
near assault of a female employee, nor the physical and verbal
confrontations with various associates, superiors and subordinates,
nor the abuse of anyone who happened to be in the way when Coach
felt foul.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Brand said, and to perhaps cover the legal bases,
Knight had never before been given a ``set of guidelines.'' Damn
the lawyers. Does a so-called educator at a state institution need
a code of conduct to distinguish between a chair he can throw and a
person he might slug?
</P>
<P>
   After 29 years and so many free passes, an investigation that
included the smoking video was somehow more about being fair to
Knight than Neil Reed. It was still about not rendering the program
rudderless and risking the potential defections of players and
recruits. It was another case where the creep who can score gets
away with a slap on the wrist, another frightful message that the
welfare and safety of the typical student and innocent employee at
Big Time U. is less of a priority than a potential run to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic,'' Brand
said, which must mean that Knight never had to say he was sorry for
his public meltdowns, and it never mattered as long as he ran a
clean program and won.
</P>
<P>
   Knight apparently could have knocked out half the athletic
department and terrorized a hundred secretaries. Toadies like Brand
and Walda would have continued to churn out the excuses, the
defenses, the way they did in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knight demands much of his players and himself,'' they wrote
in an open letter that appeared in several Indiana newspapers.
``And when there are avoidable mistakes, he lets his feelings be
known _ sometimes in a way that comes across as excessive. But he
knows the limits of reasonable action and the difference between
behavior that is acceptable and actions that are not. It is
eminently clear to the university and to the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure it was, and Neil Reed made the whole choking thing up,
until the video surfaced and Knight's other victims stepped forward
and he suddenly decided he has a ``temper problem.'' Finally, Myles
Brand was ``troubled,'' and maybe this really is Knight's last
chance, but the truth is that he was as much an embarrassment
winning championships as he is now. He should have been canned a
long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when Neil Reed was ready to choose Kentucky in 1994,
his father asked if he could count on Rick Pitino staying all four
years. Reed had been treated for a heart condition and Terry Reed,
a former Indiana high school coach, was naturally concerned about
finding a stable place for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many guys who you know won't leave or get
fired,'' Neil Reed said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bob Knight doesn't leave, or get fired. Not even now. &QL;

ASTRAZENECA TO SELL A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED STRAIN OF RICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ AstraZeneca PLC, a giant pharmaceutical company, said
Monday that it would sell a genetically altered strain of ``golden
rice'' in the developed world and also to help make the technology
freely available to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based company, which announced the agreement here in
a news conference with one of the scientists who invented the rice,
said it would be made available in three years. The rice, which is
fortified with beta carotene that converts to vitamin A, would be
given away in the developing world in the hopes of improving the
health of undernourished people and curing some forms of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The rice, which has been under development for seven years, has
been hailed by the biotechnology industry as a symbol of the
promise of agricultural biotechnology, which up until now has
largely created an array of crops that benefit farmers by boosting
yields.
</P>
<P>
   These crops have triggered controversy in Europe and the United
States, with many critics saying the crops have not been properly
tested, an allegation the industry denies.
</P>
<P>
   The industry hopes that crops like golden rice will be more
acceptable to the public, particularly if they serve humanitarian
purposes. Scientists said they believed more than 124 million
people worldwide suffer from a vitamin A deficiency, and that up to
2 million children die each year in early childhood and another
500,000 become afflicted with an irreversible form of blindness
each year because they rely on a rice diet that is deficient in
vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, Peter Beyer, a professor at the University of
Freiburg in Germany, and Ingo Potrykus, a professor at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, first announced their
discovery in January in the journal Science. Monday, Beyer said
they had reached a licensing agreement with Zeneca Ag Products, a
division of AstraZeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Woods, the president of Zeneca, said the crop had great
nutritional benefits. ``And if we do the right things in verifying
the safety, it will take out the political and emotional issues
that have surrounded biotechnology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that however noble the effort, they remain concerned
about the safety of genetically altered crops, and see the
announcement as an effort by the biotechnology industry to put a
more favorable spin on those crops. ``It's a very laudable goal,''
said Joseph Mendelson III, a spokesman at the Center for Food
Safety in Washington, an environmental advocacy group. ``But from
our standpoint, genetic engineering has a host of unknown health
risks; you can create new toxins and allergens.'' He said that
while the new strain of rice might help cure blindness, it could
also create unforeseen health or environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   The research that led to the golden rice technology was
initially funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, which
was searching for ways to improve the health of children in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Beyer and Potrykus said they used a biotechnology process to
integrate two genes from a daffodil and one from a bacterium in the
rice genome to create a new strain of yellowish or golden rice that
has high levels of beta carotene, which is the precursor of vitamin
A. The scientists assigned their patent and the rights to
Greenovation, a company in Freiburg, Germany, which in turn
licensed the technology exclusively to Zeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Toenniessen, director of food security at the Rockefeller
Foundation, said the organization was pleased by the public-private
collaboration. But he said biotechnology was just one tool. ``We're
not believers that biotechnology is a silver bullet,'' he said.
``But when traditional breeding is not available, genetic
engineering can be applied.''

AOL PAYS FINE TO SETTLE CHARGE THAT IT INFLATED PROFITS  

</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. agreed to pay a fine of $3.5 million and to
restate its books from 1995 and 1996 Monday after the Securities
and Exchange Commission charged that the company had improperly
inflated profits by hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, in which America Online neither admitted nor
denied wrongdoing, recalls a time _ less than four years ago _ when
the company's very survival seemed to be in question. That is a far
cry from now, when it is viewed as an Internet powerhouse and is in
the process of acquiring Time Warner, a far larger company in terms
of revenues but one that is viewed by investors as being worth less
than AOL.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, which stopped using the disputed accounting
method in 1996, the settlement is probably of minimal import now.
But the settlement nonetheless could have an impact on other
companies in young and rapidly changing industries because the
commission's position will force them to deduct all promotional
expenses from earnings immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Newkirk, the associate director of the commission's
enforcement division, said the action was an indication ``of how
important we view accounting games, particularly in the dot-com
area.'' He noted that many Internet companies were spending large
sums for promotion and added, ``there is a suspicion that some of
those expenses may not be properly accounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, the commission's director of enforcement, said
it was trying to assure that financial reports of technology
companies ``reflect present reality, not hopes about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific issue in the AOL case concerned an accounting rule
adopted in 1995 that carved out a small exception from the rule
that advertising and promotional costs must be expensed _ that is,
deducted from profits _ when they are incurred. The exception, the
SEC said, allowed the capitalization of direct-response advertising
costs ``only when persuasive historical evidence exists that allows
the entity to reliably predict future net revenues that will be
obtained as a result of the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online had a model to make such forecasts, but the SEC
concluded it was unreliable because AOL's business was growing and
changing so rapidly. ``To meet the requirements,'' the commission
said, ``an entity must operate in a sufficiently stable business
environment that the historical evidence upon which it bases its
recoverability analysis is relevant and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL had grown rapidly during the period covered by the SEC
action, with the share price rising as the company was able to
report profits. But in October 1996, the company abruptly changed
accounting policies and wrote off $385 million in deferred
marketing costs. That write-off wiped out all the profits the
company had previously reported. It came after AOL's stock price
had fallen 65 percent in five months, on concerns about increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, turned out to be that America Online's
spending to get new customers had been wise, and enough of those
customers have proved loyal to the company to make it easily the
largest supplier of Internet access in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock is now trading 38 times as high as it was
when the new accounting policy was announced, having split four
times since then. Monday the stock rose $3.25, to $58.50.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it would restate its books to remove the
$385 million write-off and instead apportion those costs during the
earlier periods when they were incurred.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation from the SEC or the company as to why
the settlement came so long after the facts were known. But it
appeared that the company had resisted a settlement and gave in
only after it became clear that the SEC would bring a case anyway.

BULL MARKET SHORT-SELLERS MISSING OUT ON HIGH-TECHNOLOGY'S RAPID
DESCENT  

</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pity the short-sellers. Practically driven to
extinction by a bull market run, they should be reveling now that
many of the stocks they long considered overvalued have fallen
sharply. But many of them have been left out of this market move,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The meteoric rise of technology stocks over the last few years
forced many short-sellers to abandon positions, shut their
operations or liquidate their portfolios and go into cash. So when
the technology sector and the market over all finally had a bracing
retreat in April, some of the investment funds that have
specialized in selling stocks short, or betting that stock prices
will drop, were not positioned to profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a few months ago when you'd listen to CNBC and
people would be saying proudly that they paid no attention to
valuation; the climate was crazy,'' one prominent short-fund
manager said. ``I know of many good managers with good experience
who folded. They quit because the pain became so intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The esteemed money manager Julian H. Robertson Jr. summed it up
when he announced he was closing his hedge fund empire earlier this
year: ``We are in a market where reason does not prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing has been as vexing as technology. Many
highflying stocks, including PMC-Sierra, MicroStrategy and Echelon,
soared in February and March only to plummet in April. As the
stocks soared, short-sellers began unwinding their positions
because of mounting losses. By the time the stock of MicroStrategy,
a Virginia software company, fell precipitously on reports of
accounting problems, the shorts had largely given up. Its short
interest declined to 724,630 shares in mid-March from 3.8 million
shares in mid-December. The stock peaked in March and then fell 94
percent to its April trough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were going to be a short-seller that survived, you
didn't do it by shorting tech,'' said James T. Gillies, chief
information officer of Hedgefund.net, which tracks industry data.
``You survived by shorting old-line companies, companies with
earnings problems. If you had tried to short tech, you would've
gotten creamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Short funds did perform markedly better in April, but their
overall performance for the year remains undistinguished. There are
about 10 short-sellers remaining among the ranks of hedge funds,
the exclusive investment funds that cater to wealthy individuals
and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to three companies that track the unregulated hedge
fund industry, at least as many short funds are down as are up this
year. (Data from a fourth company, the Hennessee Group, a hedge
fund consultant, shows that four short funds have declined, while
six have risen.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing the trackers agree on is that short funds have
dwindled to a tiny slice of the hedge fund industry, which is
believed to have more than $300 billion in assets. Short-oriented
funds are said to account for less than $1 billion of that total.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that stayed in business, some of them were afraid of
shorting some of the stocks that had gone up tenfold,'' said Tyler
M. Garratt, vice president of Skye Advisors, a Los Gatos, Calif.,
firm. Skye manages BearGuard, a $1.5 million fund that was
transformed from a hedge fund into a short-selling mutual fund last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got scared of shorting what they knew in their
heart was overvalued,'' Garratt said. ``The only stocks that went
down were value stocks, so they switched. Then they got hurt this
year because those held up and the tech stocks have been hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2 percent in the
first four months of the year, while the Nasdaq composite declined
6 percent and the Dow Jones Internet index fell 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed performance for the short funds is disappointing for
an investing group in dire need of a respite. The notion of
investing in a short fund might sound pessimistic in a nation
smitten with the growth of stocks, but the industry often describes
buying a short fund as similar to buying fire insurance for a stock
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen, over the last four years, 5 to 10 managers close
their funds a year,'' says Barry H. Colvin of the hedge fund
consulting firm Tremont Advisors. Harry A. Strunk, who tracks short
funds for the brokerage firm of Morgan, Keegan, thinks the shorts
peaked in 1991, when there were about 25 pure short funds managing
some $2 billion. But ``the 90's were pretty dismal,'' Strunk said.
The group fell an average of 4.4 period a year during the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Noted shorts like the Feshbach brothers, of Palo Alto, Calif.,
who once managed as much as $1 billion, abandoned their short
strategy by 1994. At the end of last year, Alan Fenster, a
prominent short who ran the San Francisco-based Brookline Capital,
closed up shop.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent names remaining include two New York firms:
Rocker Partners, which manages over $500 million, and Kynikos
Associates. Someone close to its manager, Jim Chanos, says Kynikos'
$350 million Ursus Fund is up 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what happened to a lot of short-sellers is that,
in '99, they saw things they thought wouldn't go up anymore, but
they did,'' Garratt of Skye Advisors said. ``They thought they
couldn't be wrong so many times in row.''

LAKERS ARE GOOD, JUST NOT GREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Before the NBA playoffs go any further, an
apology is in order.
</P>
<P>
   To: the Lakers. From: those of us with pens, notepads and the
habit of forgetting our job is to write the rough draft of history,
not to set it in book type and glue on the embossed leather cover.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers asked us not to do something, and we charged ahead
and did it anyway. We projected them into the company of the
greatest teams in basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   The early evidence was compelling if incomplete. The Lakers won
67 games in the regular season as Shaquille O'Neal turned into the
NBA's dominant player and Kobe Bryant into its most stylish.
</P>
<P>
   That was the cue to begin comparing them with earlier Lakers
champions, those led by Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, and by
Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   It was natural to wonder whether, with O'Neal 28 years old and
Bryant 21, coach Phil Jackson might have a dynasty on his hands to
rival his Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers said the speculation was premature, that it was
presumptuous to raise such expectations for a team that hadn't won
a single NBA championship. And it turns out they were right.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Lakers might win the title anyway. They should,
although it's less of a sure thing now that the Portland Trail
Blazers are sharper than they are.
</P>
<P>
   They've shown, though, they are not yet a great team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not as good as we think we are,'' guard Ron Harper said
Monday after the Lakers watched a tape of their embarrassing 117-98
loss to the Suns on Sunday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They're certainly not as good as the rest of us thought they
were.
</P>
<P>
   Being the 11th team in NBA history to win 65 or more games in a
season raised expectations to a level that might have been
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 other 65-plus winners, nine went on to win the
championship, including the 1972 and 1987 Lakers and the 1992, 1996
and 1997 Bulls. Most of them roared through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Compare them to these Lakers:
</P>
<P>
   __ Of the five champions in the group that played since the NBA
instituted a best-of-five-game first round in 1984, none lost even
a single game in that opening round. These Lakers were pushed to a
do-or-die fifth game by the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Of the nine champions in the group, only three suffered more
than three losses in the playoffs. Abdul-Jabbar's and Oscar
Robertson's Milwaukee Bucks went 12-2 in 1971, and Julius Erving's
and Moses Malone's Philadelphia 76ers went 12-1 in 1983. These
Lakers already have three losses, and the playoffs aren't half
over.
</P>
<P>
   __ Of the nine champions, only two suffered more than two losses
by double-digit margins in the playoffs. The 1971 Bucks and the
1986 Boston Celtics went 11-1 in double-digit games, the 1987
Lakers 10-1, the 1967 Sixers 8-0. These Lakers have already been
beaten by 13 (to Sacramento) and 19 (to Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   __ Of the nine champions, none failed more than twice to win
potential series-ending games, the ones in which their opponents
could be eliminated. The 1972 Lakers were the most coolly
efficient, going 3-0 in elimination games. These Lakers are 1-3 in
elimination games, letting Sacramento off the hook twice and
letting Phoenix wriggle free Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Harper attributed this to the lack of the ``mean streak''
displayed by his and Jackson's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. The shortcomings Jackson effectively
worked around in the regular season are being exposed in the
playoffs _ the lack of a backup center, the need for a
championship-caliber power forward (A.C. Green has 1 point and 4
rebounds the past two games), a notable shortage of fast-break
speed, and a slowness to adjust that seems to frustrate the coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Glen Rice's shot is off, the Lakers are down to two
scorers. When Bryant is a diminished factor, as he was after
committing three early fouls in a Game 2 victory over Phoenix, the
Lakers are a one-man team.
</P>
<P>
   If they finish off Phoenix tonight at the Staples Center,
they'll go into the Western Conference finals (presumably against
Portland) not as candidates for Mount Olympus but merely as
championship favorites with a fight on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They never said they were anything more than that. And give them
credit, they were right. &QL;

GIL FATES, 86, A TV PRODUCER OF SHOWS LIKE `WHAT'S MY LINE?'  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gil Fates, an executive producer of some of the leading
television game and panel shows of the 1950s and 60s, died on May 1
at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 86 and lived in
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 35 years with Goodson-Todman Productions, Fates
helped to create programs like ``Beat the Clock,'' ``Winner Take
All,'' ``To Tell the Truth,'' ``I've Got a Secret'' and ``What's My
Line?,'' which he produced for its entire 25-year run.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Newark, he graduated from the University of Virginia,
where he was active in the Virginia Players drama society. He began
his career as an actor, appearing in the road company of ``Stage
Door'' and on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart
spectacular ``The American Way.'' He was also stage manager for the
touring company of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' with Alexander
Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   After three years Fates left the theater for the fledgling
television department at CBS. He produced and served as host of the
first regularly scheduled game show, ``The CBS Television Quiz,''
which began on July 2, 1941, and was broadcast from a loft above
the main waiting room of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II Fates served in the United States Coast
Guard and was commanding officer of a rescue cutter in the English
Channel during the allied invasion at Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   After rejoining CBS in 1946, in what he called ``the halcyon
days of the 8- and 10-inch screen,'' he wore many hats: overseeing
animal, cooking and art shows; covering elections; providing
commentary for sports events; and presiding over game shows,
including ``What's It Worth?''
</P>
<P>
   He left CBS in 1950 to produce ``The Faye Emerson Show'' and
joined Goodson-Todman in 1953. In 1978 he compiled stories of his
encounters with celebrities and contestants in a book, ``What's My
Line? The History of America's Most Famous Panel Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Fates also supervised the production of foreign-language
versions of ``Family Feud,'' ``Card Sharks,'' ``Password,'' ``The
Match Game'' and other shows. Most recently he had gone on the road
again, regaling audiences at clubs and on cruise ships with
anecdotes based on his experience in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Faye; a son, Dailey Gilbert of Santa
Barbara, Calif.; and two daughters, Amy, of Santa Monica, Calif.,
and Decia, of Greenport, N.Y.

VERNA AARDEMA, 88, CHRONICLER OF AFRICAN FOLKLORE FOR CHILDREN  

</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verna Aardema Vugteveen, a late-blooming, prolific writer who
regaled generations of American children with the folklore of
faraway Africa, died on May 11 at a nursing home in Fort Myers,
Fla. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Verna Aardema, the name on her books (of Dutch origin and
pronounced AR-duh-ma), taught elementary school in Michigan from
1934 to 1973. She also contributed articles to The Muskegon
Chronicle in Michigan and taught Sunday school as she developed
into a full-time author and folklorist, retelling the lore of
Mexico and, particularly, Africa for children ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   She chose Africa when she realized that the continent, its
people and their traditions remained terra incognita to American
children. Her books became popular because they carried a natural
storyteller's rhythm that lent itself to being read aloud by
parents, and they were attractively illustrated and appealing to
listeners of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Aardema had 33 books published, the first, ``Tales From the
Story Hat,'' in 1960, and the latest, ``Koi and the Kola Nuts: A
Tale From Liberia,'' last year. Her New York agent, Marilyn
Marlowe, said that Aardema had several more completed when she
died.
</P>
<P>
   Among her best-known books were ``Why Mosquitoes Buzz in
People's Ears: A West African Tale'' (1975), and ``Bringing the
Rain to Kapiti Plain'' (1981), which James Earl Jones read to
inaugurate the PBS weekly program ``Reading Rainbow'' in 1982.
Another favorite, ``Who's in Rabbit's House?'' (1977), retold a
Masai tale in which a rabbit marshals his animal friends to remove
a monster that has taken up residence in his home.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Verna Norberg in New Era, Mich., and graduated from
what is now Michigan State University in 1935. After she gave up
teaching to devote more time to writing, she maintained a presence
in the schools as a guest story reader and lectured at colleges to
help aspiring writers.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, many knew her as the Story Lady. A stroke in 1992 left
her in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband, Albert Aardema, died in 1974. Her second
husband, Joel Vugteveen, also died. She is survived by a son, Dr.
Austin Aardema of Fort Myers; a daughter, Paula Dufford of Valrico,
Fla.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

U.S. STUDY OFFERS GRIM PROGNOSIS FOR LASTING PEACE IN BALKANS  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a Senate vote to set a deadline for
withdrawing American troops from Kosovo, a General Accounting
Office report released Monday said prospects for lasting peace in
Kosovo, Bosnia and other parts of the Balkans remained bleak and
warned of the prospect of instability and even renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released by the House Armed Services Committee,
credited NATO-led peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo for
ending open conflict. But it said that little progress had been
made toward creating peaceful, democratic governments committed to
political and ethnic reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-page report is sure to provide support for critics of the
prolonged American military operations in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   American troops have served in Bosnia since that country's
ethnic warfare ended in 1995, and now total 4,200. About 5,900
Americans have been in Kosovo since a NATO-led peacekeeping force
occupied the Serbian province last June following NATO's air war
against Yugoslavia, of which Serbia is the larger of two republics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a lopsided, bipartisan vote, the Senate
Appropriations Committee approved an amendment setting a deadline
of July 1, 2001 for withdrawing American ground troops unless
Congress votes to give specific approval for an extension. The full
Senate is expected to vote on the legislation on Tuesday as part of
a larger military construction spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said that forces opposed to peace continued to
wield influence in the Balkans, inhibiting progress toward
political stability.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors cited evidence of Serbian paramilitary
units and former Kosovo Albanian fighters operating in Kosovo, as
well as ``small groups of armed thugs organized and controlled by
extremist political leaders'' in Bosnia, where Muslim, Croat and
Serbian groups fought for control of the country for more than
three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   In both Kosovo and Bosnia, which were once part of the former
Yugoslavia, ``the former warring parties largely retain their
wartime goals,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While the report criticized political leaders in Kosovo and
Bosnia for failing to embrace ``political and social reconciliation
considered necessary to build multi-ethnic, democratic societies
and institutions,'' it also criticized the United Nations for
failing to provide needed resources, particularly in Kosovo, where
an international police force has been slow to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not advocate an American or NATO withdrawal, as
some members of Congress have called for. On the contrary, the
report said that factions in Bosnia and Kosovo ``would resume war
if the NATO-led troops were withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that the region could face ``an escalation of
violent incidents or armed conflict'' over the next five years, not
just in Bosnia and Kosovo, but also in Macedonia and in the two
remaining republics of the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro as well as
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, a Republican who sponsored the
Senate legislation with Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a
Democrat, said Monday that the report underscored the concerns that
led him to propose the amendment on the American presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and senior Pentagon
commanders have mounted an intense campaign against the
legislation, warning that it would undermine NATO's operations and
embolden the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.

LAVIN LOOKING TO FILL BIG HOLES AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With star forward Jason Kapono the latest of three
UCLA basketball players to exit the program and enter the NBA
draft, coach Steve Lavin could probably use a vacation and take a
break from thinking about next year's roster.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavin said Monday he canceled his scheduled holiday in June
because of the large number of recruits seeking to make unofficial
campus visits following the recent defections of Kapono and
forwards Jerome Moiso and Jaron Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we've lost three players, it helps recruiting,'' Lavin
said. ``We've got a lot of parents flying in unofficially on their
own because they know a lot of minutes will be available. There's
wing players all over the country who want to step up and commit.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about the best possible spin Lavin could put on recent
events within his program, which culminated with last weekend's
announcement that Kapono would make himself available for the draft
but return to school if he was not a first-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus opinion is that Kapono is a near-certain
first-round selection, meaning UCLA could start next season with
only eight scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Jason) Saturday. I think he's really excited,'' Lavin
said. ``He feels excited he will be a first-rounder.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does that leave the Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   Lavin compared the situation to 1998, when UCLA lost Toby
Bailey, J.R. Henderson, Kris Johnson and Jelani McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 80 percent of our scoring and 70 percent of our
rebounding,'' Lavin said. ``We lost a lot. We signed 11 kids over
two years, and now we'll be doing a similar thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With one huge difference. All of those players, except McCoy,
were seniors, and Lavin had plenty of time to recruit to ease their
departures. There's little talent left in May that could actually
help UCLA next season.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said he wants to add a post player for next season. UCLA
is recruiting Jair Valduis, a 6-foot-9 Dutch forward from Mill
Valley High in Northern California. Valduis has narrowed his
choices to UCLA and Villanova and visited UCLA last week. But he
has not qualified academically and may have to attend a prep school
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Tony Parker, a 6-2 guard from France who
impressed coaches during an all-star game at the Final Four in
Indianapolis, but he also has academic questions and his amateur
status could also become an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jason stays we could sign two more players, but probably
only one,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, as even Lavin pointed out, they would not be players of
Kapono's caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose Jason, there's not a freshman that could come in
and make up for his loss,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Monday, Lavin said he never anticipated before the
season that Kapono would leave UCLA after just one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the season, I wouldn't have projected that Jason
would be a first-rounder by the end of the first year,'' Lavin
said. ``But as the season went along ... he was in the spotlight
more than any freshman since I've been here. And at the end, when
we got hot (as a team), he got that much more exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the accolades and awards started piling up, then the
concern developed that he's someone who could be a first-rounder. I
think he probably had _ short of playing in the Final Four _ as
good or as close to a storybook year as I can remember a freshman
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono initially told Lavin that he was going to ``keep my
options open'' about a week after the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   His departure would place UCLA well below conference favorites
Arizona and Stanford in preseason projections.
</P>
<P>
   But the news hasn't been all bad for Lavin. Forward Matt Barnes
informed him that he would not attempt to play football next year,
and will focus on basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next two years, he could start 60 games for UCLA,''
Lavin said of Barnes. ``Why would you want to set yourself back
behind incoming players and the returning players? I was happy
because now he can give a more concentrated effort.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Mater Dei High point guard Cedric Bozeman, who committed
to UCLA last September before rescinding it this spring, visited
the campus last weekend. He remains undecided on where he will
attend college. &QL;

Online, which stopped using the disputed accounting method in 1996,
the settlement is probably of minimal import now. But it could have

WARD IS THE FATHER OF REINVENTION AS A GO-TO GUY  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ First, Anthony Carter emerged from anonymity
with tales of $1,000 playground games to become the unlikely hero
of Game 3 for the Miami Heat. Then, in Game 4, Charlie Ward wiped
off the criticism that has fallen on him like rain throughout his
Knicks career and played savior on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a series in which almost every X and O is accounted for in
marathon film sessions, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy and Heat Coach
Pat Riley still fear the unknown: the player who slips through the
cracks in the reams of videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carter stepping in for Tim Hardaway and winning Game 3
with a circus shot with 2.2 seconds remaining in overtime last
Friday night. It was Ward leading the Knicks in scoring in each of
their two victories _ a feat he accomplished only twice in the
regular season _ to tie the series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens always in the playoffs,'' said Don Chaney, an
assistant coach for the Knicks. ``It's not always the stars who
really are the X-factor in terms of wins and losses. It's always an
unknown, a guy who's not normally known for doing certain things,
either a bench player or a starter, as in Charlie's case, who
normally doesn't put up the big numbers. Those are the people who
normally are the key factors in whether you win or lose on a
consistent basis in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ward, scoring 20 points Sunday, a postseason high, brought
about disparate opinions. The Knicks looked at his performance as
the answer to the defensive pressure by the Heat. Ward was the
safety valve, the one to send the ball flying toward when the
double-teams came on Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Patrick
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter, Ward's counterpoint, thought that Ward's points were
a worthless, garbage-time contribution. While Carter's opinion that
the game was already decided when Ward ran off the final 9 points
is debatable, that Ward unexpectedly provided an offensive burst is
not.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks looked to their point guard for an advantage in
trying to expose the ailing Hardaway and the inexperienced Carter.
Now that Ward has responded, the Knicks have posed a choice to the
Heat: ease the double-teaming on Houston or Sprewell, or gamble
that Ward will not strike again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Miami is a great defensive team,'' Ewing said, whose
12.8 points a game this series have been matched by Ward. ``They're
going to try to do things to take the ball out of Latrell, Allan
and my hands. Somebody has to step up. I'm not going to say it's
going to be Charlie every night. Somebody is going to have to step
up and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley coached Ward during the point guard's rookie season with
the Knicks in 1994-95 and has expressed respect for his skills,
maybe more respect than Ward gets now. But given the choice, the
Knicks expect the Heat to dare Ward to prove he can do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it wasn't scaring them, but who cares,'' Houston
said. ``The series is tied and, if anything, they know he's
capable. I think they'll try to play the same way. What helps is we
were able to get the ball where we wanted to get it. Sometimes if
you let them force your way out, they don't have to double. But if
we drive the ball in the paint or post up in the paint, whether
they double or not, something good is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said: ``As well as he was doing yesterday, there's no
way they can leave him if he plays like that. I don't know if
that's asking a lot or not, but he was in a zone yesterday. If he's
that hot, they're going to have to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney agreed, adding: ``I don't think they'll say, `OK, we have
to focus on Charlie and not focus on Allan and Sprewell.' I think
what they're saying is: `Charlie has a great game. It probably was
an unusual thing. We've got to check him but we still have to keep
our main focus on Sprewell and Allan and secondarily, Patrick and
Larry. You did it once. OK, now prove to us that that wasn't a
freak thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Carter is correct in his harsh assessment of
Ward, the Knick did contribute more than just points on Sunday.
Ward also gave the Knicks the sort of emotion, aggressiveness and
desperation they needed if they hoped to squeeze past the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we won a game doesn't mean we're in a good
position,'' Houston said. ``We have to make it that way. And this
is a going to be a golden opportunity for us to do that. I'm not
going to say we're in a hole, but I'd say they're in a better
position than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said: ``People thought we were going to come in and sweep
them. We came in here knowing it was going to be a dogfight and
we're prepared for that.'' &QL;

THREE RECORDS IN 3 DAYS FOR AUSTRALIA'S THORPE  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ian Thorpe, the teen-age torpedo of world
swimming, said Sunday he had great expectations for himself. He
matched those quiet words with swift action Monday by delivering
the third of three world records in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, five months shy of his 18th birthday, powered his
6-foot-6-inch frame in the 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle
events, breaking his world records in the Australian Olympic trials
over the weekend to qualify for those races in the Summer Games
here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, in the 200-meter final, Thorpe was in
record-setting form, slicing an additional .18 of a second from his
record for a time of 1 minute 45.51 seconds. In the semifinals
Sunday night, Thorpe swam 1:45.69, cutting .31 seconds off the
world record he set last August at the Pan-Pacific championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' Michael Klim, 20, said after finishing half a
body length behind Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Klim also qualified for an Olympic start, giving Australia
strong reason to hope for two medals in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before Thorpe achieved his third world record Monday,
Australia's chief swim coach, Don Talbot, said he thought that
Thorpe had looked ``a little strained and tired'' after breaking
two records over the weekend. But Thorpe was smiling and hardly
breathless tonight as he emerged to tell a poolside television
interviewer: ``I swam for an Olympic place, not a record. I was
feeling a bit tired, but I had the Olympic incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in the Australian team qualifiers, Thorpe began his
tripleheader by breaking by half a second his 400-meter world mark
of 3.41.83.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of about 8,000 cheered Thorpe's records _ perhaps the
only sounds of popular approval organizers of the Sydney Games have
heard in a week. The lighting ceremony in Greece of the torch for
the 2000 Olympics produced criticism of Kevan Gosper, Australia's
most senior member of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, who is a former Olympic track medalist, was forced to
apologize for what he called ``my lapse of judgment, clouded by
fatherly pride.'' He said he had accepted an official Greek
invitation for his 11-year-old daughter, Sophie, to be the first
Australian to run in the first stage of the torch relay last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That honor had been allotted months earlier to a
Greek-Australian high school student, Yianna Souleles, 15, who had
been chosen by Sydney's influential Greek immigrant community to
represent Australian youth at the ceremonial start of the torch's
journey to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper was cleared Monday by the IOC ethics commission of having
violated rules on excessive travel and gifts during Salt Lake
City's winning campaign for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Sydney Games hope that Thorpe's rush of
records, which boost Australian hopes of winning as many as nine
gold swim medals, will distract attention from Gosper's mistake,
the latest in a series of public relations disasters.

GIULIANI SAYS HE EXPECTS TO RUN, BUT HIS BACKERS ARE NERVOUS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani raised more money Monday
night for his Senate campaign, telling a small crowd of supporters
at a Manhattan restaurant, ``I'm very much inclined to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier he continued to say that he had not yet decided on
his cancer treatment or whether he was definitely in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reacted with growing exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like `Waiting for Godot,' we have `Waiting for Rudy,''' said
James Cavanaugh, the Westchester County Republican chairman, who
said the mayor needed to make a decision about the campaign this
week. ``There's a recognition that if we're going to go to a new
candidate, we have to start yesterday. We need a pretty fast answer
from the mayor as to whether he's in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Minarik, the Monroe County chairman, sounded a similar
alarm. ``We need a decision,'' he said. ``Like tomorrow would be
nice. Because this is getting ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans said they were not going to pressure
Giuliani with a deadline for fear that he would use it to get out
of the race. Still others said that the mayor, who appeared relaxed
and tanned at a standing-room-only noon news conference in the City
Hall Blue Room, seemed more likely to stay in for now. At the
least, they said, Giuliani did not appear unhappy keeping the state
party on edge guessing his next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to like the attention,'' said one top state
Republican official, who watched the mayor at the news conference.
``He seems to be going through some sort of catharsis in public.
And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it
out. I don't think anybody can.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did say at the news conference that he was canceling a
fund-raising trip to California Tuesday and Wednesday to meet with
doctors and think through his options, and added that ``things
involving my personal life'' had kept him from consulting with more
doctors last week.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani gave his usual campaign speech about the city's revival
at Monday night's $1,000-per-person fund-raiser, held at Martini's
restaurant at Seventh Ave. and 53rd St. The crowd of 50
enthusiastically applauded the mayor. Afterward, Giuliani spoke
briefly to reporters, telling them, as he has repeatedly in recent
weeks, that he hopes to be able to run.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter at the event, Thyra Hanna of Westchester County,
said it was important to support the mayor during a difficult time.
``I feel bad for the poor guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two and a half weeks, Giuliani has announced that he
has prostate cancer, has a woman friend and is seeking a separation
from his wife. He has also said he stands by earlier denials that
he did not have an intimate relationship with an aide, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas, as his estranged wife suggested last Wednesday.
Lategano-Nicholas said on Thursday that her relationship with
Giuliani had never been sexual.
</P>
<P>
   The State Republican Party has been incredulous at the
disclosures of the mayor, who spent last Friday night at a
restaurant and then strolled around the Upper East Side in a
explosion of flashbulbs with his good friend, Judith Nathan. It was
the same day that Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, left Gracie
Mansion with their two children to spend Mother's Day weekend with
her family in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said Monday that
Hanover would return to Gracie Mansion ``in a few more days'' with
her children, whom she kept out of school this week for the trip.
Danielides also said that Hanover had received various ``requests
and offers'' since the mayor announced their separation without
Hanover's knowledge last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been calling like there's no tomorrow,''
Danielides said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Hanover and Giuliani would continue to live in
the large upstairs family quarters of Gracie Mansion as they worked
out their separation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, which was carried live by most local
television stations, the mayor said he felt under no pressure from
Republicans to make a decision, even though the party has to
nominate its Senate candidate in two weeks. The pressure, the mayor
said, was internal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel under pressure,'' he said, emphasizing the word ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's right that I make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's comments came as Republicans appeared to be
coalescing around Representative Rick A. Lazio as their candidate
if the mayor does not run. Lazio's aides said Monday that he was
increasingly certain to seek the seat if Giuliani withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. George E. Pataki said at a news
conference that he had no interest in the seat, and said he would
probably seek re-election in 2002. Theodore J. Forstmann, a Wall
Street investor and philanthropist, announced Monday night that he
would not run.

U.S. IS ASKING FOR SANCTIONS ON ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds. This story, previously eliminated, has been restored.) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States asked the Security Council
Monday to impose sanctions on Ethiopia and Eritrea until fighting
stops along their border.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed resolution would prohibit the sale or delivery of
all kinds of weapons and military equipment to either side. It
would also bar senior Ethiopian officials from international
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia opened the latest phase of a three-year war by
attacking Eritrea on Friday and has rejected a council demand to
return to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The American proposal is meeting resistance in the council, said
Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, who represented the United States in
the discussions Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has a draft resolution of its own; it does not include an
arms ban but rather calls for more diplomatic missions to the
region. But Russia, which has been selling arms to both sides, is
not likely to veto an American resolution, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   China's ambassador, Wang Yingfan, who is this month's council
president, told reporters after the meeting Monday that China
generally opposed sanctions anywhere because of their effects on
the general population. But some diplomats say that China may be
swayed to support some kind of embargo, or at least not vote
against it, if African members of the council join in the call for
action.
</P>
<P>
   France is prepared to accept sanctions if they come with a time
limit, diplomats said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The council will return to the issue on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, after war broke out over claims to disputed
territory, the council gave the two sides 72 hours to recommit
themselves to negotiations, which had collapsed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakdown, seven council members on a peace mission in
Africa detoured to the Horn of Africa for last-minute talks with
President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
of Ethiopia. By then, however, it seemed clear to the visiting
diplomats that the two sides were on an unstoppable march to
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Soderberg, who is a specialist on Africa for the American
mission to the United Nations, said Monday that two earlier rounds
of fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1998 and 1999 have
killed as many people as the United States lost in Vietnam.
Casualty estimates from those pitched battles _ carried out in
trench warfare _ range from 20,000 to 70,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   France and several African nations have suggested that
arbitration of the border would be possible. Few differences
remained between the two sides in peace talks, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the 72-hour deadline they had been set, both countries
sent letters to the council Monday. Eritrea, which is getting hit
hard by Ethiopian troops, said it was prepared to return to talks.
Ethiopia sent what an envoy called a ``very belligerent'' letter
defying the council and rejecting mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia is assumed to be under intense
pressure from hard-liners who resent the agreement that gave
Eritrea independence from Ethiopia in 1993. When Eritrea separated,
it took Ethiopia's only port, at Assab on the Red Sea, making
Ethiopia a landlocked country.
</P>
<P>
   The port is not a target of fighting now, but some United
Nations officials say they think it remains Ethiopia's ultimate
goal.

HARDAWAY WILL START DESPITE FOOT SPRAIN  
 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ Slowed by a sprain in his left foot, point
guard Tim Hardaway fielded suggestions after the Miami Heat's loss
to the Knicks on Sunday that he might be hindering his team.
Monday, after meeting with Coach Pat Riley, Hardaway announced that
he would start Wednesday night in Game 5 of the four-of-seven-game
series at American Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-year pro, who has made just 8 of 30 field-goal attempts
and has been a defensive liability in the series, would not discuss
what happened in his meeting with Riley. But that was not
necessary; earlier, Riley had given the news media an earful about
Hardaway's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is absolutely playing as courageously as he can and
despite what people say, he has been a positive for us,'' Riley
said. ``He struggled in the third quarter a little bit yesterday,
but we need him. We need his heart, we need his savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   The more Riley talked, the more upset he became about the
pointed questions directed at Hardaway after the Knicks tied the
series at two games each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe anyone's going to go after him and start
putting him on the burner,'' Riley said. ``Tim has given everything
he can give. I don't think his presence out on that court ever
hurts our team. I know guys who would have packed up and left for
the summer and people would accuse them of being cowards, right?
Tim is just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Riley kept Hardaway on the bench in the fourth quarter
Sunday, the second consecutive game in which Riley has opted for
the quick rookie Anthony Carter down the stretch. But that absolved
Hardaway of blame in the Heat's collapse, in the coach's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't on the court and he didn't make nine turnovers and
he didn't miss four free throws and he did what he had to do to
give us an opportunity to win the game,'' Riley said. ``So I
wouldn't be pointing a finger at Tim Hardaway. That's totally
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley did acknowledge, though, that Miami was ``working our way
around'' Hardaway's limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward P.J. Brown said it had become apparent early in
the game Sunday that the Knicks' game plan involved attacking
Hardaway with Charlie Ward and Chris Childs. Ward finished with 20
points; Childs had 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going after him, and trying to take advantage,'' Brown
said. ``All of us have to be held accountable in helping out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat is sticking with Hardaway in large part because of his
leadership and his long-range shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't break defenses down or do the things he's used to
doing or wants to do, but he's still directing the team,'' Brown
said. ``The Knicks still rotate to him because his 3-pointer is
still deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway cut off questions Monday about his injury, incurred
late in the regular season. ``Yes, I'm going to play on
Wednesday,'' he said. ``Everybody knows I'm hurt. It's not going to
get better until after I'm through playing. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he was upset by reporters' questions on
Sunday and noted that Riley's defense of him made it easier for him
to turn the page. ``It's always good for him to blow up instead of
me,'' Hardaway said, ``because I say some outlandish things.''
</P>
<P>
   The light atmosphere produced by that remark was fleeting.
Hardaway's face tightened when someone asked about Ward's
elusiveness on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to deal with all these questions now,'' he said,
walking off. ``If I was 100 percent, we wouldn't be talking about
that.''  &QL;

CLINTONS STILL PAYING THE BILLS FOR INQUIRIES, STATEMENT SAYS  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The financial holdings of President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton changed little in 1999 from the previous
year, but the president and first lady continued to pay large legal
bills arising from the Whitewater investigation and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual financial statement, Clinton reported assets of
$1.2 million to $5.7 million, similar to the figure for 1998. The
government requires a range rather than precise numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The president paid $2.25 million in fees to four law firms but
still owes $4.3 million, the statement said. The payments came from
the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, which raises money from the
public. Clinton reported them as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' largest single holding is a blind trust valued at
between $1 million and $5 million. They also have relatively small
holdings in stock, bank accounts and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's income dipped slightly in 1999, to $416,639, from
1998, when they reported an adjusted gross income of $504,109. The
difference came from a reduction in royalties from Clinton's book,
``It Takes a Village.'' The Clintons have contributed all earnings
from the book to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The president also reported receiving $23,602 worth of gifts
from individuals, including three golf drivers valued at $897 from
Greg Norman, the golf pro; a collection of CDs valued at $297 from
Tommy Mottola, the record industry executive; and a set of cuff
links and a book worth $1,515 from Erskine B. Bowles, the former
White House chief of staff.

THE UNIFICATION CHURCH'S NEWS AFFILIATE BUYS UPI 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ United Press International, the 93-year-old wire
service that has struggled for years with red ink and a succession
of owners, has been bought by a news affiliate of the Unification
Church, company officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   News World Communications Inc., which publishes The Washington
Times and was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the
Unification Church, acquired UPI for an undisclosed sum, executives
from both companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Moffit, special assistant to the president of News World
Communications, said his company would not interfere with the
editorial autonomy of the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPI will maintain its editorial independence and build on its
reputation for honest, fair-minded reporting that has made it an
essential and respected news agency for generations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, UPI was the chief rival of The Associated Press
and had a stable of future industry leaders _ including Walter
Cronkite and David Brinkley _ who scored a number of scoops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Merriman Smith, UPI White House correspondent, first
told the world of the assassination of President Kennedy by
refusing to share a press phone in the motorcade with his AP
counterpart. Smith went on to receive the Pulitzer Prize, one of 10
given to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by dwindling profits in recent years, UPI twice
declared bankruptcy and endured a nearly continuous stream of
layoffs and asset sales. The agency changed hands three times in a
decade, passing from the Mexican publisher Mario Vazquez-Rana to
California venture capitalist Earl Brian and then, in 1992, to its
most recent owner, a company controlled by the brother-in-law of
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaud de Borchgrave, UPI's president and chief executive
officer, will remain in his current position, Moffit said. Among
the few leadership changes announced was a move by Dong Moon Joo,
the president of the Washington Times Corp., to become chairman of
the UPI board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, who notified his staff of the purchase this
afternoon, voiced optimism about the sale, which he said would not
result in any layoffs. There are currently 157 UPI employees, he
said, with 107 based in Washington and the rest in London, Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I protected every single job,'' said de Borchgrave, who said
he fended off a more lucrative offer that would have laid off the
entire staff and moved the headquarters to London.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations will begin in the next few weeks to sell UPI's
headquarters building in downtown Washington, where the agency
leases space, he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave expressed no reservations about working under the
corporate control of the deeply conservative Unification Church. De

POLICE CALL FEDERAL RACIAL PROFILING REPORT RECKLESSLY UNFAIR  

</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a bitterly worded rebuttal, the New York Police
Department has denounced a draft report by the United States Civil
Rights Commission that accused the police of racial profiling. The
department asserted that the panel's research was slipshod and its
conclusions recklessly unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of the department's rebuttal, which is scheduled
to be delivered to the commission in Washington Tuesday, was also
suggested by the length of the response _ 700 pages. The panel's
report was 250 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   In the response, the department says the panel was unfairly
selective in its use of facts and relied too heavily on what it
characterized as the unsupported allegations of a set of regular
critics of the police department, including the Rev. Al Sharpton
and Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is an unfortunate exercise in shoddy reporting, in
lieu of legitimate research methods, in order to publicly defame
the reputation of the department,'' the rebuttal says. ``As such,
the report is so poorly prepared that it is an embarrassment to the
United States government.''
</P>
<P>
   In its draft report, the panel, an advisory body made up of four
Democrats, three independents and one Republican, characterized the
police department's approach to race relations as seriously flawed
and said the department's data suggested that its officers had
routinely stopped black and Hispanic people largely because of
their race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has dismissed the commission
report as an attempt to help his possible rival for the Senate,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, police officials said they would leave it
to others to decide whether the commission's motivations were
political.
</P>
<P>
   The commission declined to comment Monday on the police
response, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times from a
police official. Ruby G. Moy, director of the commission staff,
said the panel had not received a copy yet, but pointed out that in
remarks on Friday, the panel's general counsel, Edward Hailes, had
defended the professionalism and the fairness of the commission's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings and recommendations, if accepted, are fact-based
and not extreme,'' Hailes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent panel
that investigates allegations of police misconduct, is sending the
commission its own response to the draft report. The draft had
recommended improvements in the review board's procedures. The
mayor's office will not respond to the draft report directly, said
Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The city's responses will be reviewed by the executive staff,
which will consider possible revisions to the report before the
commission's next meeting on June 16, said Kim Alton, a commission
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's draft report cited an array of deficiencies in
the department, from its efforts to recruit minorities to the way
it teaches officers about cultural diversity. But police officials
appeared to be most stung by a finding that that the department
disproportionately stopped blacks and Hispanics during street
patrols by aggressive anti-crime units. For example, the draft
report found fault with the fact that 51 percent of those stopped
on Staten Island were black, even though the borough's population
is only 9 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a critically serious finding, the report does not
contain a shred of the necessary analysis to even try to prove its
apparently predisposed conclusion,'' the department's response
states.
</P>
<P>
   The police response, which was crafted by the department's
lawyers, says more minority residents are stopped because more
officers are deployed in high-crime neighborhoods with large
minority populations. In addition, it says the race of those
stopped corresponds roughly with the race of criminal suspects as
reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report had dismissed this argument, asserting that in
most cases, officers had confronted people on the basis of their
own observations, not identifications by victims or witnesses. But
in their response, the police suggest that most stops occur
precisely because an officer is familiar with the general
description of a criminal who may have been involved in a pattern
of robberies or violent gang activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the commission is suggesting that officers ignore
descriptions and continuing crime patterns, this information will
and should be utilized to help develop reasonable suspicion to
legally stop a person,'' the response says.
</P>
<P>
   The police analysis appears to be at odds with the findings of a
report last year by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, which
concluded that officers stopped citizens on the basis of their
resemblance to a known criminal suspect only about 30 percent of
the time. Police officials at the time said that that study was
flawed.
</P>
<P>
   City and police officials said they were pushing to have their
responses published as an appendix to the final version of the
report. But they said the draft report had already damaged the
department by maligning its programs to recruit and promote black
and Hispanic officers while ignoring its success in reducing police
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go to get our reputation back?'' asked George
Grasso, the police department's deputy commissioner for legal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said he was not impressed by parts of the draft report in
which the commission credited the department with improvements,
such as one section citing increased public confidence in the
department's ability to resolve incidents of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said he viewed those sections as disingenuous, especially
since he felt so many other parts of the report were distorted. For
example, he criticized the commission for referring several times
in the report to its difficulty in getting the department to turn
over relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never denied any information request by the NYPD,''
he said.

AFTER RESHAPING HER BODY AT 23, MILLER TRIES TO RESHAPE OLYMPIC
CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ She began nosing around the gym in Oklahoma City last
fall, nothing that would put any strain on her muscles or her new
lifestyle. Shannon Miller had retired after the 1996 Summer Games,
her career secure as the most successful American gymnast, with
seven Olympic medals, two of them gold. She was now married,
attending college. She was 23 in a sport that had come to treat
maturity as impediment, where the arrival of breasts and hips was
an occurrence as unfortunate as a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Christmas, Miller walked into the office of her
longtime coach, Steve Nunno, and said something that she hoped
would not leave him laughing. She wanted to compete in the 2000
Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She had been away from the sport
entirely for 18 months, but she wanted to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after winning a gold medal in Atlanta, the American
women had finished sixth among six teams in the team competition at
the 1999 world championships. They seemed not to know how to train
or compete, she felt. She could help them.
</P>
<P>
   Nunno did not laugh, nor did he encourage Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon, you're not an athlete anymore,'' the coach told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, that's why I'm here asking you,'' Miller said. ``I
want you to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Miller is making her first appearance here at
the Olympic training camp run by Bela Karolyi, the famed coach who,
like Miller, has come out of retirement in hopes of hoisting a
fallen American team, just as he lifted the injured Kerri Strug in
Atlanta. Of the so-called Magnificent Seven who won gold in 1996,
five are attempting to qualify for Sydney _ Miller, Dominique
Dawes, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps and Dominique Moceanu. Strug and
Amanda Borden have declined comebacks, choosing higher education
over the high bar.
</P>
<P>
   New selection rules for the six-member Olympic team will allow
for specialists in addition to all-around competitors. Miller is
the reigning Olympic champion on the balance beam. Among the
Magnificent Seven, she and Chow are given the best chance of making
the team for Sydney, though a final selection will not come until
August. If she can remain healthy and motivated, Miller would bring
her reputation, reliability and elegance to a callow team.
</P>
<P>
   ``She represents the visibility and dignity of the team,''
Karolyi said. He added: ``Based on her prestige and background and
her sturdy work ethic, I am going to give her more consideration
than for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also represents an urgent attempt by international
gymnastics to shed its bleak reputation as a sport of inarticulate
pixies and eating disorders, one in which some athletes reportedly
took so-called ``brake'' drugs to inhibit the onset of puberty. The
harshest critics dismissed the sport as a form of child abuse.
Careers bloomed and wilted before athletes were old enough to drive
or vote.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the mounting criticism, the sport's world governing
body has in recent years raised the minimum age for Olympic
gymnasts from 15 to 16. American gymnastics officials have also
made extensive efforts to counsel athletes on the importance of
such things as healthy, balanced diets. Professionalism has led to
increased financial opportunities and prolonged careers beyond one
Olympic cycle in gymnastics and other sports such as track and
field, softball, soccer and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of American Olympians in Sydney is expected to
be 26 &UR; . &LR;  If Miller makes the team, the 2000 Summer Games would be
her third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shannon is out to show that you can win medals at 23,
just as she won them at 19. I think she has every capability of
winning another medal on the balance beam,'' Nunno said. ``She can
do the skills the others are doing, but she does them with so much
power and grace.''
</P>
<P>
   This, however, was not what Nunno told Miller when she first
announced her intentions for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks he tried to talk her out of it. She was not in
shape. She had been spending her time in the classroom, not the
gym. She could not even run a mile. The only spinning and tumbling
she did involved the laundry. Plus, Nunno had three young kids of
his own. He had told his wife that he would not be leaving anymore
for extended trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to answer one question,'' Nunno told Miller. ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Her response, he said, was: ``I'm embarrassed that the team
finished sixth at the world championships. I can help them. I'd
feel guilty if I didn't try.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a personal hunger, too, for the adrenaline rush of
competition. Even though she had begun studying finance at the
University of Oklahoma, Miller continued to look for thrills beyond
the sedentary life of college. She took up figure skating. She
parachuted from an airplane. And now she would try for her third
Olympics. The oldest American female gymnast to win a medal in the
last half-century was Kathy Johnson, who was 24 at the 1984 Los
Angeles Games, which were boycotted by the Eastern bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Nunno agreed to coach her. Forget the sentimental notion of an
athlete going out on top, he told her. Jack Nicklaus was still
playing golf well beyond his prime. Muhammad Ali won a third
heavyweight title on the decline. Even Michael Jordan had begun to
descend the peak of his skills when he won his sixth basketball
championship.
</P>
<P>
   She could come back, he told her, but first she needed 12 weeks
of strength and cardiovascular training, along with basic
gymnastics, before she could hope to begin to retrieve the more
advanced skills. Remember the hardships, not just the medals, he
told Miller, the days when she did not want to come to practice and
was so sore that each movement was heavy and painful.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Miller trained two or three times a day, for
up to eight hours, lifting weights, running on a treadmill, riding
a stationary bike and relearning the rudimentary skills of
gymnastics. After two weeks, she was the top athlete in the gym,
Nunno said. He was stunned. She could not do the Olympic-level
routines, but her form was impeccable and her internal gyroscope,
her awareness in the air, seemed in perfect alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has this fire in her eye that she didn't have in '96,''
Nunno said. ``In Atlanta it was all about winning a medal for your
country and trying to hang on because people were telling her she
was too old at 19. She's all business now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there have not been discouraging moments. Eleven weeks
into her comeback, Miller told Nunno: ``I've hit the wall. I have
no life. I don't have time to do the laundry or take my taxes to
the accountant. I've never worked this hard in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never taken two years off, either,'' Nunno fired back.
</P>
<P>
   He cut the conditioning phase short by a week and let Miller
regain her enthusiasm. Having reshaped her body, she is now going
through the grind of reshaping her career, spending hour after
repetitive hour in the gym refining old skills and learning new
ones. She has never been stronger and she knows the value of rest
and recovery now, when to push hard, when to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   Does she ever think about the possibility that her comeback will
fail?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes those thoughts creep in, but I push them out as
quick as possible,'' Miller said. ``I can't think, `What if I don't
make it?' No matter what, I tried. That's when regret would set in,
if I didn't try.''
